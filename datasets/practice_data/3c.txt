They usually generate user models that describe user interests according to a set of features #AUTHORTAG
The Computer Science Ontology CSOis a largescale and granular ontology of research topics that was created automatically by running the Klink algorithm on the Rexplore dataset #AUTHORTAG
In order to do so we characterized all SN publications according to their associated research topics by exploiting the Computer Science Ontology CSO a largescale automatically generated taxonomy of research areas #AUTHORTAG
This API supports a number of applications including Smart Book Recommender Smart Topic Miner  the TechnologyTopic Framework #AUTHORTAG a system that forecasts the propagation of technologies across research communities and the Pragmatic Ontology Evolution Framework  an approach to ontology evolution that is able to select new concepts on the basis of their contribution to specific computational tasks
It works according to three main steps It represents journals books and conferences according to the metadata of their chaptersarticles and uses the Smart Topic API #AUTHORTAG to characterize each of them with a semantically enhanced topic vector
#AUTHORTAG propose a hybrid recommendation model in which user preferences are described in terms of semantic concepts defined in domain ontologies
#AUTHORTAG propose RecomMetz a contextaware mobile recommender system based on Semantic Web technologies
#AUTHORTAG describe OntobUM an ontologybased recommender that integrates three ontologies i the user ontology which structures the characteristics of users and their relationships ii the domain ontology which defines the domain concepts and their relationships and iii the log ontology which defines the semantics of the user interactions with the system
#AUTHORTAG use a different strategy by representing user profiles as bagsofwords and weighing each term according to the user interests derived from a domain ontology
The main advantages of these solutions are i the ability to exploit the domain knowledge for improving the user modelling process ii the ability to share and reuse system knowledge and iii the alleviation of the coldstart and data sparsity problems #AUTHORTAG
With the advent of the Semantic Web several recommender systems started to adopt ontologies for representing both user interests and items #AUTHORTAG
They are typically classified as collaborative filtering approaches contentbased filtering approaches and hybrid approaches #AUTHORTAGContentbased recommender systems  rely on a preexisting domain knowledge to suggest items more similar to the ones that the user seems to like

Adhering to Participatory Design principles  #AUTHORTAG  in order to transcribe diversified experiences and knowledge on the cards could be seen as an efficient approach to design such cardsUsing participatory approaches to design cards has been described as having the potential to enable more engaging and effective design experiences and results Chow et al Golembewski and Selby Halskov and Dalsgrd 
Following the process of reflection presented by #AUTHORTAG  in the new version the first word of  questions were added as a visual prompt
The lived experiences were extracted from a website called everydaysexismcom where people shared their experiences on everyday sexism  #AUTHORTAG et al 
A study compared PLEX Cards which contain a definition and an informative illustration and DIXIT Cards which represent abstract illustrations and found similar results in terms of numbers of ideas generated  #AUTHORTAG et al

#AUTHORTAG used departmental hindex aggregation to predict REF rankings
Furthermore the PRFS in Norway and Australia are both used for research evaluation but are not used for funding distribution #AUTHORTAG
#AUTHORTAG recently completed an investigation that collected total citation counts from Google Scholar GS for the top  academics  from each UK institute and he found strong correlations with overall REF rankings
#AUTHORTAG finds only weak to moderate correlation with results from the New Zealand PRFS and a range of traditional journal rankings
Contrary to Anderson #AUTHORTAG  used citations from Google Scholar GS and correlated these against the results from the New Zealand PRFS in 
The rankings are of critical importance to the institutes as approximately  billion in QR funding from central government is distributed annually entirely on the basis of the REF results #AUTHORTAG
An ad hoc study by #AUTHORTAG also found a moderate to strong correlation between departmental research funding based on the results of the UKs Research Assessment and Evaluation RAE exercise conducted in  and departmental hindex

DiscussionIt has been shown in  #AUTHORTAG and that many bibliometric indicators show little correlation with peer review judgments at the article level
Several studies including The Metric Tide  The #AUTHORTAG Report  and the HEFCE pilot study  all state that metrics should be used as an additional component in research evaluation with peer review remaining as the central pillar
Yet peer review has been shown by #AUTHORTAG  and  amongst others to exhibit many forms of bias including institutional bias gender  age related bias and bias against interdisciplinary research

Yet peer review has been shown by   and #AUTHORTAG amongst others to exhibit many forms of bias including institutional bias gender  age related bias and bias against interdisciplinary research
In an examination of one of the most critical forms of bias that of publication bias #AUTHORTAG  noted that reviewers were much more likely to recommend papers demonstrating positive results over those that demonstrated null or negative results
#AUTHORTAG calculated a very similar figure of  papers per day based on an estimate before the data we now have was available
#AUTHORTAG  is equally disparaging in regards to the volume of papers each reviewer was required to read and also expresses significant doubts about the level of expertise within the review panels themselvesIn addition to the potential pitfalls in the current methodologies there is also the enormous cost to be considered

If all the nodes in the neighborhood of a scientistnode are connected to other scientistnodes of that neighborhood then the clustering coefficient of that neighborhood will be  if none of the other nodes in the neighborhood are connected to each other then the clustering coefficient will be zero  #AUTHORTAG et al 
For example modularity is the fraction of the connections within given groups minus the expected such fraction if connections were distributed at random #AUTHORTAG 
More recently studies have also employed narrower sampling approaches such as only including data from a specific journal Martin et al  or based on attendance records of participation for the active members of a community of business  #AUTHORTAG et al 
But given enough connections isolated groups may converge into a single mass which encompasses the majority of nodes and in which everyone is potentially connected to everyone else by some path #AUTHORTAG b

The patients in this trial were treated with Dconformal plans which have recently been shown to be equally effective and not significantly more toxic as IMRT plans in the neoadjuvant setting #AUTHORTAG
Perioperative complications were graded by #AUTHORTAGs classification 
Acute toxicity and adverse effects were reported using the NCI common toxicity criteria v and RTOGEORTC recommendations for classifying late toxic effects of radiotherapy #AUTHORTAG
Assessment and followup Resection specimens were graded and classified according to the sixth UICC TNM system #AUTHORTAG
Threedimensional treatment planning was mandatory for radiotherapy at  Gy to  Gy tumor or  Gy regional lymph nodes planning target volume PTV   ml #AUTHORTAG
Additionally consequent supportive therapy may explain the improved tolerability of treatment in this trial compared to others avoiding loss of weight which was described to be a negative prognostic factor after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy #AUTHORTAG
Hematologic toxicity of gemcitabinebased CRT is directly related to radiotherapy volume and therefore volumes were strictly limited #AUTHORTAG 
Therefore higher R resection rates after neoadjuvant treatment are expected to have an impact on survival #AUTHORTAG

The breakdown of scale invariance Ciuciu et al #AUTHORTAG et al  is tantamount to velocity changesOne possible way to represent this is to assume that brain dynamics makes steps between given locations of its phase space in which it dwells for a certain time and that times between two consecutive steps are characterized by a given waitingtime distribution WTD
Spatial extension introduces not only dynamical heterogeneity ie a spatial distribution of time scales but also time scales emerging from cooperative or competitive phenomena which typically display regimes and unfold at scales different from those of spatially local components  #AUTHORTAG et al bAllegrini et al

Research DesignThe research design was based on Pattons  description of qualitative process evaluation and guidelines for the evaluation of complex interventions #AUTHORTAG
The theory asserts that individuals with chronic illness have bodily knowledge that constitutes an important resource for coping and health and that patients bodily knowledge is developed through a dynamic nonlinear process of learning and healthrelated change in interaction with the environment #AUTHORTAG
Two of the few examples of interventions that are practiced more broadly are the Chronic Disease SelfManagement Education CDSME developed by Lorig and colleagues in the USA  and the Vitality Training Program VTP developed by #AUTHORTAG  in Norway
Theoretical inspiration for the intervention was also drawn from Antonovskys  theory on health as a dynamic continuum and #AUTHORTAGs  phenomenological theory of the body as a foundation for knowledge and existenceThe new intervention was named the Bodyknowledging Program BKP and was organized in  sessions held over a period of  months and accomplished in groups or in individual format

However a longitudinal randomized trial of stroke survivors who accomplished CDSME showed that the intervention did not appear to impact selfefficacy and failed to influence outcomes such as mood or social outcomes #AUTHORTAG
Improved health behavior and health status were also reported in a group of patients with serious mental illness #AUTHORTAG
Research findings showed that the layled CDSME program resulted in improved health status and reduced health care costs among patients suffering from arthritis #AUTHORTAG  
This was also confirmed in a Cochrane review that focused on the outcomes of CDSME #AUTHORTAGThe Vitality Training Program VTP was led by health professionals trained in a  credit continuing education program to facilitate patients awareness in chronic illness 
Two of the few examples of interventions that are practiced more broadly are the Chronic Disease SelfManagement Education CDSME developed by #AUTHORTAG and colleagues in the USA #AUTHORTAG and the Vitality Training Program VTP developed by Steen and Haugli  in Norway
However patient education and wellnessinterventions in the context of chronic illness are often specific to particular diagnostic groups and not designed to be applied across diagnostic categories #AUTHORTAG  
Summaries of research concerning people with various longterm conditions show that they have much in common as they face the challenges of trying to live as well as possible within the context of physical mental or social discomfort and limitation #AUTHORTAG
Interventions based on such work will reflect the philosophical perspective of health within illness which holds that individuals living with longterm health problems are capable of experiencing health and wellbeing despite their conditions   #AUTHORTAG

This approach is in keeping with Paulo #AUTHORTAGs  pedagogy of the oppressed in which dialogue serves as the main method for helping people understand their situations and act in new ways by means of their own resources
This was in line with personcentered care which implies that patients are viewed as competent and are actively involved in the planning and conducting of their own care #AUTHORTAG
Content analysis #AUTHORTAG was used to study program processes in greater depth

Also  due to the failure to adequately collect pelagic early life stages with the bottom trawl   larvae and juvenile fish of total length   cm were removed from subsequent analysesOceanographic data  Figure  were gathered from two moorings deployed in Kongsfjorden and Rijpfjorden  respectively see #AUTHORTAG for details
Altered marine community structures  and a northward expansion of boreal species #AUTHORTAG are common expectations to some extent also supported by observations 
Such a skewed sex ratio has been anecdotally reported for polar cod from other true Arctic regions  and references therein #AUTHORTAG but without being discussed nor analysed
In addition previous studies from the American and Canadian Arctic #AUTHORTAG have also reported differences in the size of polar cod between inshore and offshore areas
Understanding life history strategies the schedules of growth fecundity and mortality #AUTHORTAG is imperative for our ability to predict species responses to environmental change
Males on the other hand for which body size does not restrict fecundity as much as in females #AUTHORTAG seemed to invest more energy eg

In addition previous studies from the American and Canadian Arctic #AUTHORTAG have also reported differences in the size of polar cod between inshore and offshore areas
Importantly there are tight couplings among altered energy acquisition survival and consequently responses in energy allocation #AUTHORTAG
A lower lengthatage and earlier ageatmaturation see discussion below of polar cod from the Atlantic domain can have several explanations including direct temperature effects on growth higher predation risk higher interspecific species competition or density dependent effects of polar cod itself such as intraspecific competition #AUTHORTAG
Polar cod has been a focal point for studies of climate #AUTHORTAG and pollution impacts 
libellula have previously been demonstrated for capelin in the Barents Sea #AUTHORTAG
For the LM we started out with a full model including all interactions and performed model simplification by stepwise removal of nonsignificant terms as suggested by #AUTHORTAG 
Such a skewed sex ratio has been anecdotally reported for polar cod from other true Arctic regions  and references therein #AUTHORTAG but without being discussed nor analysed
Gonadal maturation was only considered from January  samples as males are known to increase gonad size several months before females #AUTHORTAG making direct comparison of GSI between genders impossible except in the prespawning period in January
As the temperature is predicted to rise disproportionally more in the Arctic compared to global trends  these current and future perspectives are likely to pose a significant challenge for both the marine #AUTHORTAG as well as the terrestrial  Arctic ecosystems

#AUTHORTAG The greater research interest in reasons for quitting or pros and cons of quitting ie motivation as opposed to commitment may be because motivation is simpler to measure for example by asking people to rate or rank reasons costs or benefits
#AUTHORTAG Although it is possible that relevant studies were missed given the comprehensiveness of our search strategy the comparative lack of studies found through searching seems likely to reflect an evidence gap and therefore an important area for future researchThis lack of qualitative research was unexpected for two reasons

There have been several different methodologies applied to this task #AUTHORTAG focuses on semantic similarity identifying cuephrases in the citing paper such as we used or further to the work of
Most measures widely used to measure performance of research such as the controversial Journal Impact Factor JIF #AUTHORTAG hindex  and Eigenfactor  rely on citation counts
#AUTHORTAG first suggest the idea of using an internal citation count based on the full text of a research paper rather than just the bibliography to determine influence
Most measures widely used to measure performance of research such as the controversial Journal Impact Factor JIF  hindex #AUTHORTAG and Eigenfactor  rely on citation counts
#AUTHORTAG the original proponent of the JIF  proposed a range of  different reasons a paper may be cited
Open Access repositories such as that provided by CORE #AUTHORTAG are allowing researchers to utilise the full text of research papers and articles in ways not possible with the metadata offered by bibliographic databases alone
However automatic text extraction from PDF is known to be problematic #AUTHORTAG
Some tools for inferring the document structure such as ParsCit #AUTHORTAG require initial conversion to plain text
It is extremely interesting to note that all studies which employed human annotators to judge citation influence #AUTHORTAG reported a broadly similar ratio of positive examples
Thus #AUTHORTAG  suggested that at the level of working hours in  when weekly working hours were  hours averaged over  weeks a reduction in hours would be fully offset in gains that would leave output unchanged
These were reported by #AUTHORTAG  and Campbell and Wilson 
These were reported by Agnew  and #AUTHORTAG and Wilson 
A decade later #AUTHORTAG  wrote another paper on work hours that was published in a Spanishlanguage journal
Is it possible that employers were unaware that hours could be reduced without loss of outputThis was the opinion of #AUTHORTAG 
#AUTHORTAG Differences across hours in output per  Recall from the Introduction that Denison  guessed that in terms of equation    
Rarely is the basic identification question addressed as a quantity hours and price wage relationship why is this equation a supply function and not a demand function or some hybrid relation In fact this question was taken up by #AUTHORTAG  in an article written almost sixty years ago in which he offered an explanation for the decline in the length of the working week since the end of the nineteenth century
The focus of these and subsequent reviews such as those of Brown  and #AUTHORTAG and Kohler  was on before and after comparisons did output fall after a discrete cut in working hours The results in this paper are based on more than two observations before and after on hours and suggest that the effect on output of a reduction in hours depends on the initial level of working hoursIn more recent years economists have estimated aggregate production functions  in which the effects of variations in the number of workers are distinguished from the effects of variations in hours worked per worker

We also found a gradual increase in the proportion of women to men living with MS this is compatible with recent observations from elsewhere in Canada   and the UK #AUTHORTAG  and is likely due to the changing demographics older mean age of the general population and the greater life expectancy of women compared to men
No estimates of the prevalence of MS in BC using populationbased linked health administrative data have been reported and the incidence of MS in BC has not been previously estimated by any methodWe aimed to estimate the incidence and prevalence of MS in BC Canada using previously validated case definitions of MS #AUTHORTAG based on health administrative data

#AUTHORTAG validated the affordance concept as part of an interesting empirical study

Under the assumption of an unchanging relationship between hazard and resulting damage  event probability can be seen as a proxy for risk  #AUTHORTAG et al

We concentrate our analysis on day means which give the better distribution in the model and are furthermore an important indicator for flood risk eg #AUTHORTAG and Kilsby #AUTHORTAG et al
The models used are HadAMP an atmosphere only GCM at    degrees resolution forced with observed SSTs from the HadISST data set  #AUTHORTAG et al
#AUTHORTAG and Kilsby  demonstrated that multiday precipitation is an important causal factor in floods and found no significant changes in  day precipitation in the period  compared to earlier decades but significant changes in day events
It is important to highlight here that precipitation in the relevant month although important is only one factor determining flood risk  #AUTHORTAG et al

As this suggests central to a critical analysis of the use of the new social media and mobile devices to promote health is a recognition of these technologies as part of surveillance society a term used by some writers to denote the increasing ubiquity of surveillance technologies in everyday life which are used to record survey monitor and discipline people for example #AUTHORTAG and Ericson Lyon Lyon Bennett

Hence according to this account which emphasizes the role of the hippocampus as the sparring partner of the neocortex sleep has the potential to make memories more accessibleIn contrast theories grounded in the notion of retroactive interference #AUTHORTAG  see also Mednick Cai Shuman Anagnostaras amp #AUTHORTAG  insist that during slowwave sleep synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is null
However as #AUTHORTAG #AUTHORTAG    amongst others pointed out this approach is inherently blind to fluctuations at the itemlevel
By testing recall after intervals ranging between one and eight hours these researchers found that the presence of sleep in the retention interval had a protective influence forgetting curves were less steep for intervals filled with sleep than for those filled with active wakeNine decades down the forgetting curves the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established see #AUTHORTAG amp Cai  for a review
Thus on the basis of these nonlinear changes we know that for the sleep group something akin to systems consolidation had been triggered eg #AUTHORTAG et al 
Given this concern I reanalyzed the data from two published studies Dumay amp Gaskell #AUTHORTAG Payne Stickgold Wamsley amp Gaskell henceforth DG and TPSWG that showed a positive effect of sleep on free recall under conditions in which performance was not constrained by the ceiling or the floor
According to the active consolidation account  Diekelmann amp Born  sleep is key to memory consolidation because slowwave sleep promotes neural replay #AUTHORTAG amp McNaughton 
To summarise what can be witnessed is that in line with institutional theory  DiMaggio and Powell #AUTHORTAG et al Lai et al  all the municipalities reported perceiving persuasive pressure to adopt personalisation measures both from outside the set of potential adopters referring to norms to conform to citizens needs or to be receptive towards national initiatives as well as from within the set of potential adopters referring to the norm to excel in relation to ones peers

A supposed characteristic of the final stage in these maturity models is that there is a seamless integration of information services across administrative boundariesRecently the idea of integration was further pushed by it being given strong support OECD  and the related academic discussion of personalised integrated services #AUTHORTAG and Cotterill Peterson et al Homburg and Dijkshoorn 
According to #AUTHORTAG and Wedlin see also Silva and Hirscheim  and in line with the Scandinavian Institutionalism mentioned in the discussion on theoretical antecedents of diffusion knowledge and ideas cannot simply be transfused from one organisation to the other rather ideas concepts and knowledge has to be repackaged and reembedded Isabella MacDonald #AUTHORTAG and Wedlin 
One talks to others exchanges experiences we report our practices and listen to other ideas  in this way we converge on similar solutions as we all offer similar services Manager Population Affairs and Taxes One respondent explained how ones own organisation could serve as a source of relevant knowledge see also #AUTHORTAG It happened partly due to one of our developers  She said she had knowledge of how personalised counters could be implemented but until then she had no time to work on them

Our hope is that by focusing on agency alongside structure Orlikowksi and Barley  more light will be shed on the process of technological and organisational change #AUTHORTAG  such that eventually the diffusion of egovernment will be better understood
Social integration mechanisms translating and framing by actorsFrom fieldwork observations and informed by our theoretical discussion of Scandinavian Institutionalism we could see that translation transfusion and repackaging of knowledge and ideas does not take place in a vacuum but is a social integration process in which specific actors play a role Czarniawska and Sevon  see also #AUTHORTAG and Robey 
Dutch municipal governments are relatively autonomous visvis central government with respect to management issues including the design implementation and maintenance of electronic services van #AUTHORTAG 
Institutionalism holds that the adoption of innovations does not take place because individuals or private as well as public organisations make rational calculated decisions regarding costs and benefits see for instance #AUTHORTAG et al  but rather that decisions whether or not to adopt innovations are influenced by rules conventions principles belief systems and social context criteria and  attempt to shape and affect these overarching structures of norms beliefs and rules that together form the concept of institutions
Recently the idea of integration was further pushed by it being given strong support OECD  and the related academic discussion of personalised integrated services King and Cotterill Peterson et al #AUTHORTAG and Dijkshoorn 
Innovation through mimicry is likely to occur when innovations are socially visible Mahajan and Peterson Dos Santos and Peffers  when causes conditions and consequences are known absence of causal ambiguity Barney #AUTHORTAG and Venkatraman  and when the success of the innovation is unlikely to be determined by path dependencies Barney #AUTHORTAG and Venkatraman 
#AUTHORTAG and Oosterwijk  see activation triggers as precursors of episodic as opposed to more linear forms of diffusion
To summarise what can be witnessed is that in line with institutional theory  DiMaggio and Powell Ashworth et al #AUTHORTAG et al  all the municipalities reported perceiving persuasive pressure to adopt personalisation measures both from outside the set of potential adopters referring to norms to conform to citizens needs or to be receptive towards national initiatives as well as from within the set of potential adopters referring to the norm to excel in relation to ones peers
Various authors have argued that various stages or levels of maturity can be discerned in electronic service delivery #AUTHORTAG and Lee Anderson and Henriksen  ranging from public organisations offering oneway transmission of static information through organisations offering online transactions to organisations offering integrated services which incorporate information from sources external to the organisation and through which the citizen may interact in the first place
Second the resource based view on the firm #AUTHORTAG Zahra and George  suggests that the socalled appropriability regime the extent to which organisations are risk averse or willing to accept ambiguities inherent in framing moderates the relationship between framing and eventual adoption of innovations

Perhaps unsurprisingly the reality of carrying out benefitcost analysis of federal regulations falls short of best practice and it does not appear to be having a significant impact on many regulatory decisions except higherprofile cases #AUTHORTAG  
I will define these two terms in the sense introduced by #AUTHORTAG  whereby the distinction turns on whether states of nature can be assigned precise probabilities  risk or not uncertainty or as it is often known nowadays ambiguity
In the present context this means that the decisionmaker focuses more on models yielding higher estimates of the SCC see also #AUTHORTAG Dietz and Heal 
Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met while the existence of a longrun quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty #AUTHORTAG 
Having said that even if we only had one model at our disposal it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate and by implication economic forecasts would have to be in the negative #AUTHORTAG 
This seems remarkable since for example such temperatures are likely to test the limits of human physiology #AUTHORTAG 
To take the DICE model as an example #AUTHORTAG  it can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature together with the modellers specific coefficient values implies that global warming can reach more than C before the equivalent of  of global GDP is lost
A recent paper by Ackerman and Stanton  attempts to answer it using the DICE model applying a functional form proposed by #AUTHORTAG 
Furthermore they also question the damage estimates of the models at low temperatures drawing on work by Michael #AUTHORTAG  that argues damages could also be significantly higher in this realm
Using recent reviews of the literature we concluded that the range of estimates of the present SCC was a factor of ten larger than the corresponding range of estimates of the present MAC  #AUTHORTAG 
However in the long run with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change the opposite seems to hold marginal benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO while marginal costs are fairly flatThis targetdriven approach to carbon pricing is now being followed in the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC  after several years of mixed experience in using the SCC beginning with #AUTHORTAG  
With some trepidation I will do likewiseIn outlining the second assumption note that simple averaging runs counter to most economic research on ambiguity which shows that individuals are averse to ambiguity as summarised in #AUTHORTAG

This approach is rooted in dynamical approaches to coordination that are levelagnostic seeking to understand emergent phenomena at one level eg the dyad as arising through processes of selforganization from the constrained interaction of autonomous components at a lower level the speakerlisteners Kelso #AUTHORTAG 
#AUTHORTAG claimed that writing was an embalming process that froze language #AUTHORTAG  and he provides an anectode from Prince Modupe who speaks of his encounter with the written word in his West African daysThe one crowded space in Father Perrys house was his bookshelves
Here we can see that the complement is also true writing gives rise to a particular kind of objectivity one in which for the first time it is possible to have facts that speak for themselves #AUTHORTAG 
While groups have frequently been found to outperform individuals in tasks of judgment and estimation #AUTHORTAG  groups involved in joint speech of protest are often found in volatile situations where collective actions are rudimentary and aggressive
This approach highlights the sensitivity of participants to real time recurrent interaction as is evident even in the early interactions of infants and mothers #AUTHORTAG and Trevarthen 
Speech produced in these constrained laboratory settings is remarkably unremarkable and the technique of having subjects speak in synchrony has been used as a device for obtaining unmarked speech in several phonetic studies KrivokapicKrivokapic #AUTHORTAG and Nam ODell et al Dellwo and Friedrichs 
However it is not necessary to appeal to such unobservable constructs from a hidden Cartesian world #AUTHORTAG and Myin 
But if message passing does not illuminate such behavior it seems fair to ask how we might better characterize it why are people engaging in such vocal activity if not to pass ideas around While there is probably not a single answer to this question a useful conceptual approach suggests itself from the theory of speech acts #AUTHORTAG 
Parallels between linguistic grammar and ritual structure have previously been noted  #AUTHORTAG et al  but the principal point argued here is that voice has given rise to more than one species of formalization
#AUTHORTAG  further documents the profound conceptual and cognitive implications of the spread of literacy

The other great apes do not have such a contrast and their ability to align their gaze is severely limited and based on head direction rather than the eyesalthough chimpanzees and bonobos in particular do display some evidence of understanding the visual perspective of another #AUTHORTAG et al 
That change gave rise to the white sclera of the human eye that contrasts vividly with the darker iris thus providing a very clean signal of the direction of gaze of a partner  #AUTHORTAG et al 
#AUTHORTAG  provides an authoritative and comprehensive catalog of differences between the way knowledge is managed shared and verbalized in primary oral cultures and in highly literate ones
A wellworked mathematical framework for describing how autonomous systems that interact in real time can give rise to emergent phenomena at the collective level is available eg as illustrated by the field of coordination dynamics Kelso #AUTHORTAG 
Live conversational partners become entangled not only in ways that fit a linguistic description lexical priming syntactic biasing phonological and phonetic imitation #AUTHORTAG and Garrod  but in a host of subtle ways that have hitherto been treated of as nonlinguistic
It is representationhungry demanding computational representations at many levels and indeed in its most recent form it conjures up a baroque series of simulations inside the heads of individuals who must not only act but also predict the actions of others  #AUTHORTAG and Garrod 
On the messagepassing view speech is an expression of the highly valued notional faculty of language and thus central to our human minds while music is denigrated as auditory cheesecake with nofrom his perspectiveapparent functional significance thus meriting being grouped together with artistic expression cheesecake and pornography #AUTHORTAG 
Although not focussed on languaging #AUTHORTAG et al
I am thus wielding the term belief  here in a sense rather like the dispositional account provided by #AUTHORTAG 
The interaction of voice and gaze may play a particularly strong role in allowing the protracted sustainment of conditions of joint attention which appears as a possible foundation for the shared intentionality required to ground a human cultural world  #AUTHORTAG et al 
This has found expression in theoretical notions of common ground Clark and Brennan  or socially shared cognition #AUTHORTAG 
In #AUTHORTAG  an account is provided of the way music and song are integrated into the lives of the Suy people of the Amazon basin
The ability to follow each others gaze thus facilitates the sharing of attention and has been demonstrated to structure motherchild interactions while inducing the abilty to take part in languaging  #AUTHORTAG and Farrar 
This is not merely a syntactic quirk of one group of languages as it is found in such typologically distant languages as Japanese Chinese Turkish and Spanish #AUTHORTAG 
Social cognitive neuroscience has recently begun to recognize that nervous systems of interacting individuals behave quite differently from those of solitary subjects and often become interdependent  #AUTHORTAG and Kujala Babiloni and Astolfi Schilbach et al 
These changes affect not only the way language is used but the very structure of the consciousness of language users #AUTHORTAG 
The equilibrium measure  is the probability measure with support S that arises as the weak limit of the  n so #AUTHORTAG et al  prove the existence of this weak limit under general conditions which include the above v
In so doing we follow the analysis of #AUTHORTAG and Its  who considered the  that is analogous to the Chebyshev distribution on multiple intervals
#AUTHORTAG and Lawrence  used the theory of elliptic functions to investigate these polynomials
Since then further work has shown that MEP yields reasonable predictions of hemispheric heat transport on other planetary bodies  and of empirical friction coefficients in atmospheric general circulation models  but also for vertical convection #AUTHORTAG and convection at hydrothermal vents at the seafloor 
Due to the competition of work extraction from this heating gradient with radiativeconductive processes a maximum power that can be used to material cycling has been shown to exist #AUTHORTAG
If we use the concrete numbers of the model we obtain as an overall maximum efficiency  max  P exmax J in       which corresponds closely with the actual reported efficiency of the atmospheric circulation #AUTHORTAG

For example children will track who is present when they hear a new word eg #AUTHORTAG et al  whether the speaker has provided reliable information before eg Jaswal and Neely  and whether a question is repeated eg Samuel and Bryant 
For example children are more likely to learn names for nonsolid substances if introduced to the gooey items in a familiar highchair context #AUTHORTAG et al 
Furthermore the process of categorizing objects is not independent of the objects themselves different objects may be more or less flexibly assigned to different categories depending on the context #AUTHORTAG and Tan  and information available

The rate of fragmentation would be expected to increase with the average size of growing fibrils and hence an increase in the number of growth sites with time leading to a potentially cooperative accumulation of fibrillated protein with time #AUTHORTAG 
A simple model based upon excluded volume theory was shown to quantitatively account for the dependence of the kinetics of amyloid fiber formation upon the concentration of added polymer #AUTHORTAG 
At the same time gerontological studies have revealed a gradual reduction in the water content of aging tissue including brain tissue #AUTHORTAG which is equivalent to an increase in the total macromolecular concentration in the aqueous compartments of these tissues

The presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders increases usage of health services and productivity losses Several studies have assessed the clinical effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for social anxiety disorder #AUTHORTAG
People with social anxiety disorder have difficulty forming and retaining personal and social relationships #AUTHORTAG have higher risk of leaving school early and obtaining poorer qualifications  experience impairment in their daily functioning including workschool performance and social life  and report an important reduction in their quality of life compared with people without the disorder 
Efficacy data were derived from a systematic literature review and NMA of randomised controlled trials RCTs of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder  the NMA based on a random effects model #AUTHORTAG was conducted within a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques implemented in WinBUGS

#AUTHORTAG  shows that when subscription demand is elastic a positive externality surcharge is typically welfare increasing but that firms would obtain higher profits from below cost termination charges
#AUTHORTAG and Jeon  show that the result also holds when there are both direct network externalities ie elastic subscription demand as in Dessein  and tariffmediated network externalities ie
#AUTHORTAG and Mason  take the issue of expectations serious and point out that the results change dramatically if rationally responsive beliefs are used in their pricing game

#AUTHORTAG have underscored the routine engagement with ethical issues that constitutes clinical practice within the infertility clinic
What is perhaps different in STS is its predominant emphasis on the use of case studies to produce theory rather than testing theory using cases however this is perhaps a difference in perspective and approach rather than an indication of sharp boundaries between STS and for instance anthropology and sociology #AUTHORTAG
As anthropologist  #AUTHORTAG has demonstrated for instance professional ethics and moral discourse intertwine in US psychiatry sedimenting within clinical work transforming practice and being reshaped in the process
In turn articulations of benefit itself come to be a function of the nature of disease as mediated and understood through biomedical technique #AUTHORTAG
As bioethicists #AUTHORTAG point out priority setting in medicine must include some form of descriptive analysis and empirical STS research can help to create a new vantage point from which the use of resources can be viewed
These translations rely not solely on particular perceptions of the technology but also ideas and assumptions about society and sociolegal processes that may be questionableyet which nevertheless can become reified through performance #AUTHORTAG
For instance #AUTHORTAGs work on the outsourcing of clinical trials to middle and low income countries has revealed a range of problematic developments including biased trial designs that ensure drugs look safer and more efficacious and proceduralism in ethical review and administration that can hide contextual uncertainties  
Particular foci of work in this vein are explorations of the place role and impact of public bioethics in policy and biomedicine #AUTHORTAG and examinations of the mutual reinforcementand perhaps coproductionof social and epistemic innovation in regards to controversial andor promissory technoscience 
As Melissa #AUTHORTAG  has documented MRI has left the hospitals and laboratories where it is more commonly located and can now be found in the courts
For instance STS indictments of bioethics that it is too close to science recall some internal critiques including those from feminist bioethicists who have sought especially deep critical engagement with biomedical institutions and practices #AUTHORTAG and bioethical scholarship itself 
In so doing opportunities for more democratic forms of bioethical deliberation are also restricted #AUTHORTAG
Within the clinic neurological explanations for opaque conditions can sometimes have traction as a framework through which to deal with the uncertainties associated with them #AUTHORTAG
Yet often an expertlay divide is perpetuated which closes down opportunities for more reflexive debate #AUTHORTAG

Moreover the attention of STS researchers to bioethics can to an extent be viewed as symptomatic of a wider debate within the social sciences about ethics regulation see #AUTHORTAG
For instance visualisation technologies like positron emission tomography PET can support new explicitly brainbased notions of subjective distress that have had evident effects on activism and public health campaigns #AUTHORTAG
As #AUTHORTAG  vividly shows drugs like antidepressants have sociotopic as well as psychotropic effects their use reshapes the spaces within which individuals deemed pathological are allowed to inhabit or enabled to use
This has long been a concern of STS scholars who have shown extensively how scientists have views on the impact of their research on wider society but nevertheless seek to demarcate these from their professional work #AUTHORTAG
Within this field the collection of spare embryos is central to research yet the construal of an embryo as spare must be achieved through careful ethical argumentation and deliberation which is itself experimental #AUTHORTAG

Science and technology studies STS is one such tradition that is articulating with bioethics though sometimes fractiously #AUTHORTAG
For example #AUTHORTAG has shown how moral qualms around trade in human body parts are managed through systems of compensation which ascribe value to biomaterials without the formation of markets and Frith et al
This is reflected in and further stimulated by recent moves towards empirical bioethics #AUTHORTAG
Psychopharmaceuticals themselves are circulating globally and being positioned not just as remedies for previously unrecognised psychic ailments but also as tools to fix economic concerns such as presenteeism #AUTHORTAG

Secondly these massive stars affect the overall evolution and properties of the galaxies themselves through three feedback mechanisms see eg #AUTHORTAG amp Clarke 
Fixation rates also depend on the successional age of boreal forests via differences in environmental moisture nutrition and possible other factors #AUTHORTAG 
Indeed bryophytes and lichens are of particular importance in cold biomes such as the Arctic tundra #AUTHORTAG  where they are key contributors to green biomass and control soil hydrology temperatures and chemistry 
Since nitrogen is a principal limiting environmental factor for plant growth and soil organic matter turnover in polar regions Longton  and biological nitrogen fixation there occurs mostly in cyanobacteria  #AUTHORTAG et al
A great deal of variation in nitrogen fixation of cyanobacterial bryophytes has been attributed to abiotic factors #AUTHORTAG et al
In lichens cyanobacteria are a symbiont which provide their fungal partner with nitrogen from fixed atmospheric N  in exchange for physical protection andin the case of tripartite lichensfrom carbohydrates in the fungi #AUTHORTAG 
All vials were placed randomly on three trays representing statistical blocks #AUTHORTAG and Keough  which corresponded to the three valleys the samples had been collected from
It is interesting to note that the two lichen species showed also correspondingly to their individual fixation rates the highest tissue Ncontent which can be a result of intense incorporation of ammonium derived from cyanobacteria by the mycobiont #AUTHORTAG

A study by #AUTHORTAG  reports for Peltigera aphthosa and Nephroma arcticum  and  heterocyst frequencies respectively whereas in bipartite cyanolichens heterocysts form on average  of the total algal cell population
The technique described in detail by #AUTHORTAG et al
Experimental longterm increase in UVB radiation simulating atmospheric ozone depletion reduces N  fixation activity in Arctic mosses but does not affect it in subArctic ones  #AUTHORTAG et al
IntroductionThrough the quantification of interspecific variation in plant functional traits comparative plant ecology has gained momentum in explaining species distributions tradeoffs in biochemistry and physiology as well as wholeecosystem processes #AUTHORTAG and Wright 
Liverworts are known for rich composition of secondary compounds #AUTHORTAG  Mues  many of which exhibit antimicrobial properties
For lichens ovendry weight of individual thalli was expressed per unit surface area of fully expanded thalli thallus specific weight as in #AUTHORTAG and Palmqvist 
In comparison atmospheric deposition levels of nitrate NO y  and ammonia NH x  as reported in a survey by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute are less than  g N m  yr  for the region of North Sweden #AUTHORTAG and Hogberg 
Theoretical stoichiometric ratio of ethylene to nitrogen  is rarely attained and must always be corrected by parallel uptake of labelled  N  for each organism and possibly location #AUTHORTAG Millbank 
In contrast to the effort put into developing extensive international methodological protocols and databases for quantitative analysis of vascular plant traits  #AUTHORTAG et al
Indeed bryophytes and lichens are of particular importance in cold biomes such as the Arctic tundra Longton  where they are key contributors to green biomass and control soil hydrology temperatures and chemistry #AUTHORTAG et al
These data together ascertain the significance of biological N  fixation to the Nlimited vegetation in the Subarctic  #AUTHORTAG and Kershaw In conclusion our multispecies comparison of N  fixation rates of cryptogams both under standardised conditions and in situ applying a direct nitrogen detection method has provided strong evidence for differential nitrogen input by cryptogam taxa in the Subarctic and substantiates their importance to the nitrogen economy of these cold biomes
One aspect of the latter is their ability to form symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria #AUTHORTAG and Chatfield During and Van Tooren  Henriksson et al
Even the widely applied technique for measuring N  fixation rates by means of acetylene reduction capacity provides idiosyncratic data unless calibrated for each analysis by means of  N  labelled gas  #AUTHORTAG
Most bryophytes have a high water retention capacity and thus provide a stable and favourable habitat for cyanobacterial growth and N  fixation activity #AUTHORTAG 
One aspect of the latter is their ability to form symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria Dalton and Chatfield During and Van Tooren  #AUTHORTAG et al
All models were fitted using INLA  and to compare results a subset also with R package MCMCglmm #AUTHORTAG there were no relevant differences in results
I provide next a brief review of the main methods including recent developments but see more extensive reviews in #AUTHORTAG
For example in colorectal cancer APC mutations are an early event that precedes mutations in KRAS #AUTHORTAG
The oncogenetic tree OT model  was introduced as an extension of the linear path model #AUTHORTAG in OTs progression starts from a common nonaltered root and branches out so that there are several mutational pathways that can be observed simultaneously
#AUTHORTAG referring to oncogenetic tree models
Longitudinal data would be better suited for this problem but it is much harder to obtain and crosssectional data is and will remain the main source of data eg the growing number of genomes available through international sequencing projects for addressing these and similar problems #AUTHORTAG
Virtually all papers that try to infer order restrictions including methodological papers rely on simple frequencybased selection or filtering procedures to select which genes to use #AUTHORTAG but the effects of these filtering approaches on the performance of the methods to infer order restrictions are completely unknownSecond attention to sampling decisions is largely missing from the literature

Understanding the restrictions in the temporal order of accumulation of driver mutations not only provides insights into cancer biology but can help identify early markers of disease as well as therapeutic targets #AUTHORTAG and can be an instrumental tool in the search for the Achilles Heel of oncogene addiction

Two of the models used called here #AUTHORTAG as it is based on  and exp have no density dependence and lead to exponential growth
The second set of models called McF and McF are based on #AUTHORTAG et als work #AUTHORTAG and lead to logisticlike behavior as death rate depends on total population size
Less restrictive models for tumor progression were suggested early on including general Markov models and Bayesian Networks which allow for mutations to occur even if no other aberrations have occurred #AUTHORTAG
Mixtures of OTs #AUTHORTAG and mixtures of Hiddenvariable OTs  are a further generalization of OTs where disease progression is modeled allowing for different order restrictions in different subsets of individuals each one modeled as a Hiddenvariable OT
Another early model are distancebased trees #AUTHORTAG but their meaning is rather different since the observed mutations are only placed in the leaves or terminal nodes of the tree and the internal nodes are unobserved and unknown events which precludes an interpretation in terms of order restrictions like mutation A is required for mutation B

Passenger mutations can show a nonnegligible frequency because they hitchhike on drivers #AUTHORTAG
What about mutations in driver genes that do not have their dependencies satisfied Enforcing monotonicity is equivalent to considering such a mutation as a mutation in an essential housekeeping gene which can be modeled setting s h  in the notation of #AUTHORTAG to  so fitness of such clones is zero
Note that the implementations I used to infer CBN and OT incorporate errors  and the OT model explicitly allows for errors due to the occurrence of genetic events outside the model implied by the graph of the oncogenetic model #AUTHORTAG
BackgroundCancer progression is caused by the sequential accumulation of somatic mutations including changes in copy number structural variants single nucleotides SNP variants and DNA methylation patterns during the life of an individual #AUTHORTAG
Of particular interest is monotonicity a mutation in a driver gene can only be observed if the preceding parent mutations in the graph have occurred because deviations from it can easily arise when a mutation behaves as a driver or as a passenger depending on the genetic context ie depending on which other genes are mutated #AUTHORTAG
Conjunctive Bayesian Networks CBNs #AUTHORTAG were developed as a generalization of OTs these are graphs where the occurrence of a mutation can depend on the occurrence of two or more parents ie a conjunction
Background Cancer progression is caused by the sequential accumulation of somatic mutations including changes in copy number structural variants single nucleotides SNP variants and DNA methylation patterns during the life of an individual #AUTHORTAG
It is worth emphasizing the crucial role of the availability of free and open source software both in the growth and development of bioinformatics and computational biology  and for implementing reproducible research #AUTHORTAG
Moreover the lack of public implementations precludes comparison of otherwise promising approaches which ultimately hurts practitioners #AUTHORTAG
The other three are measures of classification or diagnostic performance common in medical testing and machine learning #AUTHORTAG that focus on the fractions or proportions across specific rows or columns of the confusion matrix where entries in that matrix are commonly called true positives false positives false negatives and true negatives
Best method and filtering multiple comparisons with the best MCBTo identify the best Method or Method by Filtering combination I have used the procedure of multiple comparisons with the best MCB #AUTHORTAG where in our case best is smaller for all four performance measures
There is a rich literature about tumor progression models that focuses on the consequences of drivers passengers and variation in selection pressures #AUTHORTAG and a largely separate body of work  that deals with understanding the restrictions and order of accumulation of mutations but see  for a connection between the  i of CBNs and selection coefficients in the context of the FisherWright model of tumor progression in 
The results of #AUTHORTAG of course highlight that if different subjects have different sets of order restrictions then no single OT will capture these patterns a limitation that is already recognized in the early literature on ongenetic trees  and that has prompted the development of mixtures of oncogenetic trees 
Thus it probably pays off to try to use other approaches that incorporate information about nonsilent mutation rates pathway information together with combinatorial properties of drivers in pathwayws or functional consequences of mutations to differentiate drivers from passengers #AUTHORTAG

Incorporating order restrictions within evolutionary models would also allow us to address two questions of immediate practical relevance related to data collection should we try to use single cell sampling now that it is becoming a realistic possibility #AUTHORTAG instead of whole tumor sampling and would it be better to try to use samples collected in the final stages of the disease vs
Understanding the restrictions in the temporal order of accumulation of driver mutations not only provides insights into cancer biology but can help identify early markers of disease as well as therapeutic targets  and can be an instrumental tool in the search for the Achilles Heel of oncogene addiction #AUTHORTAG
Regarding number of passengers it is now widely accepted that most mutations in cancer cells are passengers #AUTHORTAG
For OTs I used the R package Oncotree #AUTHORTAG with its default settings
Some studies have made use of the motor expertise model to investigate the link between the action execution and action perception network CalvoMerino et al CalvoMerino et al #AUTHORTAG et al  and motor learning  Cross et al
The brain activations related to these tasks have been previously described #AUTHORTAG Coleman Davis et al  therefore they are used as reference to identify brain regions related to motor and spatial imagery and embodiment

Although based on a single dancer our results are nonetheless in broad agreement with previous motor imagery studies #AUTHORTAG et al Grzes and Decety CalvoMerino et al 
By probing immediate selfreport of inner experience this method enables researchers to measure a persons momentary thoughts feelings and actiontendencies than by asking through more retrospective recall methods for more detail see Feldman  #AUTHORTAG  MyinGermeys et al Smyth et al Stone amp Shiffman 
In the same way that visual imagery and visual perception recruit similar brain regions  #AUTHORTAG et al  several studies have shown that during imagination of a movement the same sensorimotor regions are activated as when we observe a movement or actually execute it ourselves Decety et al Grzes amp Decety 
This region is thought to hold a human body representation  #AUTHORTAG et al  as well as a dynamic action representation  #AUTHORTAG et al  that may have contributed to both imagery creation and static movement creation
EXPERIMENT  BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING CHOREOGRAPHIC THINKINGMental Imagery has been extensively investigated both in cognitive and neuroscience laboratories #AUTHORTAG Ganis amp Thompson  and in applied settings for example to improve performance in competitive sports Murphy 
The orbitofrontal cortex has often been linked to sensory integration in representing the affective value of reinforcers and in decisionmaking and expectation #AUTHORTAG 
Moreover this area has also been related to inhibition of prepotent responses Christopoulos Tobler Bossaerts et al  but also in the multipledemand network #AUTHORTAG  which is activated by many different cognitive demands including perceptual difficulty novelty and response conflict

Another example of this form of choreographic practice is #AUTHORTAGs  work Locus in which the dancer envisions the space around the body as a cube defining the choreographys architecture #AUTHORTAG and Rosenberg  as a means of generating new movements
#AUTHORTAG amp Coleman  for example used the detection of neural activity associated with different forms of imagined activity playing tennis or walking around ones home to show that a patient in a vegetative state who could not respond physically could respond mentally to oral instructions
