To summarise what can be witnessed is that in line with institutional theory  DiMaggio and Powell Ashworth et al Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies et al  all the municipalities reported perceiving persuasive pressure to adopt personalisation measures both from outside the set of potential adopters referring to norms to conform to citizens needs or to be receptive towards national initiatives as well as from within the set of potential adopters referring to the norm to excel in relation to ones peers	0	0

I will define these two terms in the sense introduced by The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  whereby the distinction turns on whether states of nature can be assigned precise probabilities  risk or not uncertainty or as it is often known nowadays ambiguity	0	1
In the present context this means that the decisionmaker focuses more on models yielding higher estimates of the SCC see also The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Dietz and Heal 	3	1
Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met while the existence of a longrun quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	5	1
 Having said that even if we only had one model at our disposal it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate and by implication economic forecasts would have to be in the negative The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	0	0

To take the DICE model as an example The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  it can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature together with the modellers specific coefficient values implies that global warming can reach more than C before the equivalent of  of global GDP is lost	5	1
A recent paper by Ackerman and Stanton  attempts to answer it using the DICE model applying a functional form proposed by The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	5	1
Furthermore they also question the damage estimates of the models at low temperatures drawing on work by Michael The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  that argues damages could also be significantly higher in this realm	0	0

However in the long run with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change the opposite seems to hold marginal benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO while marginal costs are fairly flatThis targetdriven approach to carbon pricing is now being followed in the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC  after several years of mixed experience in using the SCC beginning with The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  	0	0

Another early model are distancebased trees Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression effects of passengers evolutionary models and sampling but their meaning is rather different since the observed mutations are only placed in the leaves or terminal nodes of the tree and the internal nodes are unobserved and unknown events which precludes an interpretation in terms of order restrictions like mutation A is required for mutation B	0	0
Virtually all papers that try to infer order restrictions including methodological papers rely on simple frequencybased selection or filtering procedures to select which genes to use Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression effects of passengers evolutionary models and sampling but the effects of these filtering approaches on the performance of the methods to infer order restrictions are completely unknownSecond attention to sampling decisions is largely missing from the literature	5	0

Of particular interest is monotonicity a mutation in a driver gene can only be observed if the preceding parent mutations in the graph have occurred because deviations from it can easily arise when a mutation behaves as a driver or as a passenger depending on the genetic context ie depending on which other genes are mutated Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression effects of passengers evolutionary models and sampling	0	0

The results of Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression effects of passengers evolutionary models and sampling of course highlight that if different subjects have different sets of order restrictions then no single OT will capture these patterns a limitation that is already recognized in the early literature on ongenetic trees  and that has prompted the development of mixtures of oncogenetic trees 	0	0
