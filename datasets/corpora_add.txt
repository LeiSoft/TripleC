The present study builds on the existing literature that underscores the value of fuzzyset qualitative comparative analysis fsQCA eg Fiss      amp Zhang   and shows that the proposed methodological tool offers much in terms of understanding causal relationships by virtue of providing information that is unique in comparison with the information conventional correlational methods provideMoving beyond multiple regression analysis to algorithms Calling for adoption of a paradigm shift from symmetric to asymmetric thinking in data analysis and crafting theoryExamining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzyset qualitative comparative analysis
As such fsQCA is a proficient tool that helps supplement traditional correlational analyses in three main ways :   asymmetry ie the relationships between independent and dependent variables are treated as not symmetric   equifinality ie multiple pathways and solutions lead to the same outcome and   causal complexity ie combinations of causal antecedent conditions lead to the outcome and thus the researcher focuses not on the estimation of independent net effects but on the estimation of combinatorial effects    Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis An introductionExamining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzyset qualitative comparative analysis

Hence according to this account which emphasizes the role of the hippocampus as the sparring partner of the neocortex sleep has the potential to make memories more accessibleIn contrast theories grounded in the notion of retroactive interference     see also Mednick Cai Shuman Anagnostaras amp     insist that during slowwave sleep synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is nullThe psychology and neuroscience of forgettingSleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible
However as         amongst others pointed out this approach is inherently blind to fluctuations at the itemlevelIntratrial and intertrial retention Notes towards a theory of free recall verbal learningSleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible
By testing recall after intervals ranging between one and eight hours these researchers found that the presence of sleep in the retention interval had a protective influence : forgetting curves were less steep for intervals filled with sleep than for those filled with active wakeNine decades down the forgetting curves the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established see    amp Cai   for a reviewMemory consolidationSleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible
Thus on the basis of these nonlinear changes we know that for the sleep group something akin to systems consolidation had been triggered eg    et al Shift from hippocampal to neocortical centered retrieval network with consolidationSleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible
Given this concern I reanalyzed the data from two published studies Dumay amp Gaskell    Payne Stickgold Wamsley amp Gaskell henceforth DG and TPSWG that showed a positive effect of sleep on free recall under conditions in which performance was not constrained by the ceiling or the floorSleep spindle activity is associated with the integration of new memories and existing knowledgeSleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible

In the present context this means that the decisionmaker focuses more on models yielding higher estimates of the SCC see also    Dietz and Heal Ambiguity and climate policyThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis
Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met while the existence of a longrun quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty    The Economics of Climate Change The Stern ReviewThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis
Having said that even if we only had one model at our disposal it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate and by implication economic forecasts would have to be in the negative    What might we learn from climate forecastsThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis

A recent paper by Ackerman and Stanton   attempts to answer it using the DICE model applying a functional form proposed by    GHG targets as insurance against catastrophic climate damagesThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis
Furthermore they also question the damage estimates of the models at low temperatures drawing on work by Michael     that argues damages could also be significantly higher in this realmWhat is the economic cost of climate change The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis
Using recent reviews of the literature we concluded that the range of estimates of the present SCC was a factor of ten larger than the corresponding range of estimates of the present MAC     Environmental prices uncertainty and learningThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis
However in the long run with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change the opposite seems to hold : marginal benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO while marginal costs are fairly flatThis targetdriven approach to carbon pricing is now being followed in the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC   after several years of mixed experience in using the SCC beginning with     Estimating the social cost of carbon emissions Government Economic Service Working Paper The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis

to provide great exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses Huelsenbeck   Rannala   and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships Kuhner   Felsenstein   Huelsenbeck   Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions but almost no published quantitative results It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times will exhibit too few dierences to contain useful evolutionary information Equally sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change high rates or long times become saturated with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise Consequently a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence but the symptotic results for extreme high and low levels of divergence give no clue as to where this lies Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms see Hillis et al   pp   for an extensive list of studies where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchersa priori expectations In addition a large laboratory eort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the eects of varying levels of divergence They conrm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang   This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful treetopology inference The approach may be extremely timeconsuming for realistic problems The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed Li et al   considered the eects of adding outgroup taxa and Ritland   Clegg   and Maddison et al

For example Kawato et al   suggested that movement trajectories can be projected using critical viapoints through which the trajectory has to pass at a certain time rather than in terms of the momentbymoment dynamics of the implemented movement trajectory Optimal trajectories can then be learnt by applying local optimising principles for getting from one viapoint to the next In this way impoverished predictions can be used to monitor rich implementations In the same way language users might predict particularly crucial aspects of an utterance but the aspects that they predict will depend on the circumstances More generally Meyer   Hagoort question the value of predicting ones own utterance They argue that prediction is useful when it is likely to differ from the actual event This is the case when predicting another persons behaviour or when the result of ones action is uncertain eg moving in a strong wind But they argue that people are confident about their own speech Meyer   Hagoort admit that they will tend to be less confident in dialogue and we agree But more important we argue that the behaviour of the production implementer is not fully determined by the production command because the complex processes involved in production are subject to internal neural noise or priming ie influences that may not be a result of the production command Assuming that these sources of noise do not necessarily affect forward modelling as well predicted speech may differ from actual speech In addition prediction is useful even if the behaviour is fully predictable because it allows the actor to plan future behaviour on the basis of the prediction In fact we made such a proposal in relation to the order of heavy and light phrases see sect   target article Hartsuiker claims that our account incorrectly predicts an early competitor effect in Huettig and Hartsuiker   His claim is based on the assumption that ResponsePickering   Garrod : An integrated theory of language production and comprehension

multiple equilibria see Albanesi et al   King and Wolman   and Blake and Kirsanova   and a simple New Keynesian model is not appropriate to investigate many consequences of policy delegation As there is no particular reason to assume one equilibrium will prevail any more than another even if the delegation schemes behave locally as intuition might suggest globally could be a different matter The central questions addressed in this paper follow on from this How do delegation schemes affect the likelihood of obtaining multiple equilibria in more realistic models ? If multiplicity survives how should we quantify the welfare implications of choosing one of these delegation schemes ? Can any of these schemes affect the likelihood that economic agents successfully coordinate on the best equilibrium ? To address these questions we study a version of the familiar sticky price model modified to incorporate capital accumulation Sveen and Weinke   Woodford   This model contains all the features as at the heart of many DSGE models used in policy analysis which makes it a representative agent for our policy analysis Moreover we choose a set up which encompasses the worst case scenario : there are expectation traps and economic agents may be more likely to coordinate on the worst equilibrium Dennis and Kirsanova   We confirm the previous results that all these delegation schemes can improve social welfare but we show that they only unequivocally improve welfare if the economy remains in the best equilibrium At the same time we demonstrate that none of the considered delegation schemes eliminates expectation traps moreover new equilibria arise under delegation Whether there is a gain associated with a transition to a delegation scheme will depend on which equilibrium under the original unmodified objective one starts from and to which equilibrium one transitions More encouragingly all delegation schemes reduce the range of parameters which ensure the unique worst equilibrium thus increasing the likelihood of coordinating on the Paretopreferred equilibrium We also argue that a delegation scheme can change the way how agents coordinate on an equilibrium In particular we show that price level targeting increases the likelihood that the best equilibrium realizes The paper is organized as follows In the next section we outline the model and discuss the calibration Section   recapitulates the analysis in Blake and Kirsanova   for our stickyprice model with capital showing how multiplicity arises when monetary policy is conducted under discretion and with an unmodified monetary policy objective

br A recent work Bhuiyan et al   in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their nontransfected counterpart regardless of passage number early or late More likely discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type transfection protocols Bhuiyan et al   NT methods and donor cell culture conditions Wells et al   Miyoshi et al   Furthermore the site of genes integrations the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results Hodges and Stice   Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes since Heyman et al   found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates ranging from   to   and Khholzer et al   even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy   day   of gestation rates between transfected and nontransfected donor cells which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al   In contrast Forsberg et al   reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of nontransfected cells In our study the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and nontransgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term Nevertheless we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability since nontransgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation though one initial TFCE pregnancy   days of gestation was interrupted On the other hand two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al   and Brophy et al   who observed a lower pregnancy rate   day   of gestation and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their nontransfected counterpart

to provide great exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses Huelsenbeck   Rannala   and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships Kuhner   Felsenstein   Huelsenbeck   Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions but almost no published quantitative results It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times will exhibit too few dierences to contain useful evolutionary information Equally sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change high rates or long times become saturated with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise Consequently a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence but the symptotic results for extreme high and low levels of divergence give no clue as to where this lies Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms see Hillis et al   pp   for an extensive list of studies where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchersa
priori expectations In addition a large laboratory eort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the eects of varying levels of divergence They conrm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang   This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful treetopology inference The approach may be extremely timeconsuming for realistic problems The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed Li et al   considered the eects of adding outgroup taxa and Ritland   Clegg   and Maddison et al   are agreed that if outgroups are to be added they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa a conclusion that is conrmed in this paper More recently consideration of the estimation of large phylogenies has led to the contradictory advice that the number of sequences included in a study be reduced Kim   and increased particularly to break long branches in trees Hillis   in order to improve inferences see also Hillis   Although it is not clear that the latter strategy will always be successful Zharkikh   Li   Kim   Strimmer   von Haeseler   and Hillis

to provide great exibility in testing evolutionary hypotheses Huelsenbeck   Rannala   and simply to give excellent results in the inference of evolutionary relationships Kuhner   Felsenstein   Huelsenbeck   Constraints imposed by computational complexity are becoming less restrictive as computers improve Given the recognition of phylogenetic inference as being inherently statistical in nature it is surprising that so little attention has been paid to experimental design A number of topics of relevance to experimental design in phylogenetics have been discussed previously There is something of a folklore surrounding the choice of genes or other genomic regions for investigating particular evolutionary questions but almost no published quantitative results It is widely accepted that sequences that have undergone very little evolutionary change since their divergence from a common ancestor through low substitution rates or short evolutionary times will exhibit too few dierences to contain useful evolutionary information Equally sequences that have undergone very large amounts of change high rates or long times become saturated with changes and no evolutionary signal is detectable amid the noise Consequently a happy medium is expected at some intermediate level of sequence divergence but the symptotic results for extreme high and low levels of divergence give no clue as to where this lies Although there is considerable experience with particular genes and organisms see Hillis et al   pp   for an extensive list of studies where comparisons among genes have been made they tend to be evaluated empirically by the congruence of the results obtained among themselves and with researchersa priori expectations In addition a large laboratory eort is needed before even these qualitative conclusions can be reached The methods introduced in this paper can quantify the eects of varying levels of divergence They conrm the belief that intermediate levels of sequence divergence are most useful and are able to give estimates of optimal levels of divergence The necessary analyses can be done before any data are collected The only other method for assessing which genomic regions are likely to be most useful in phylogenetic questions is that of Yang   This uses simulation to estimate probabilities of successful treetopology inference The approach may be extremely timeconsuming for realistic problems The choice of taxa to include in phylogenetic studies has also rarely been discussed Li et al   considered the eects of adding outgroup taxa and Ritland   Clegg   and Maddison et al   are agreed that if outgroups are to be added they should not be too distantly related to the ingroup taxa a conclusion that is conrmed in this paper

Many techniques for bone defatting are described in the literature including mechanical cleaning with water or air jet acetone   ethanol solution enzyme detergents hydrogen peroxide aqueous sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite NaOCl We adopted the latter technique because it has been found suitable for formalinized specimens is safe for personnel and is very low cost
However the relationships between those polymorphisms and susceptibility to AS remain unclear some studies on association between PD CTLA polymorphisms and AS risk had used comparatively small samples   and the results about the role of PD or CTLA gene polymorphisms in AS patients are inconsistent and inconclusive
Intuitively this is done by using packed secretsharing   where several values are packed and then shared in a single instance of secretsharing
The FE model predicted that the piston stapes prosthesis implantation would affect the RW membrane displacements which is consistent with the experimental data reported by Wysocki et al   and Stenfelt et al b
It has also been shown that rapamycin can prevent chronic mechanicaloverloadinduced increases in fiber size ie hypertrophy Bodine et al   Goodman et al a
these traits are strict seasonal breeding cathemerality equal activity during both day and night low basal metabolic rates a low degree of frugivory a highly variable food source for primates of their body size female dominance and a lack of sexual dimorphism reviewed in Wright
In   Sigurjonsson and Kim obtained bounds on the capacity region for twouser MACs with identical causal side information at the transmitters
We used the apparent modulus to estimate apparent bone strength ultimate stress MPa according to previously determined linear relationship between these two outcomes
This deceleration can be caused by the structural change of the MnCaO catalyst that occurs upon the S   S transition andor by the additional oxidation of the OEC
Importantly the results of Pascalis et al   also revealed that the now   montholds ie those infants who received additional exposure to the monkey faces still showed reliable discrimination of monkey faces whereas a second group of montholds who did not receive the   months of
As suggested by Nguena et al there is a need to educate health professionals in remote areas and to develop a simpletofollow algorithm to aid in the accurate diagnosis of OSSN The use of smart phone applications that are available in ophthalmology to transmit images from the field to the referral centers would be another way to improve early diagnosis of OSSN
Skeletal muscle is also a primary site of disease in mouse models of ALS Dobrowolny et al   Wong and Martin   Luo et al   and possibly in human ALS Vielhaber et al
ACTIVATION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS Roles for several transcription factors have been demonstrated in TLR activation including APbinding proteins such as cjun and cfos and NFB Akira   Kawai and Akira   and some of these have been implicated in TLR signaling in the mast cell
Most studies focused on the relation between brain activation and motor function Guzzetta et al   Staudt et al   or the effects of intervention on brain activation Golomb et al   Sutcliffe et al   Walther et al   You et al   Cope et al
