Three possible mechanisms by which the colony collectively chooses the better of two nests have been proposed: i)

Emigrating social insects are a good model system for the study of collective decisionmaking, because all members
share the aim of coming to a consensus about a new, good nest site as soon as
possible, but the information about available site quality is distributed very unevenly within the colony [15Strategies for

In addition, peroxiredoxins being abundant in brown adipose tissue contribute to the seasonal behavior under conditions
in which the coordination by the suprachiasmatic nuclei is weak ( Epperson et al., 2004), being
reminiscent of those in which the time-keeping mechanisms are challenged ( Redefining the limits of day
length responsiveness in a seasonal mammal et al., 2008) and circadian desynchrony is likely to emerge
(van Oort et al., 2007)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood
These findings suggest that brown adipocytes and circadian clocks, of whose components the cryptochromes do react to ultraviolet
radiation (Human cryptochrome exhibits light dependent magnetosensitivity et al., 2011), are not only relevant to survival and adaptation,
but also targeted by natural selectionHypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and
The proteins encoded by the cryptochrome genes ( Hsu et al., 1996) are likely to be of key importance
here, because of their unique role in the core of circadian transcriptional feedback loops ( Identification of small molecule
activators of cryptochrome et al., 2012;Padmanabhan et al., 2012), via their interaction with 5 -AMP-activated protein kinase (Um et
al., 2011; for review, see Jordan and Lamia, 2012) whose activity in turn controls the activity of brown adipocytes
( Lpez et al., 2010)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related Behaviors
The circulating blood is a carrier of heat which follows not only the circadian rhythm of core body temperature
guided by the suprachiasmatic nuclei ( Buhr et al., 2010), but also the ultradian fluctuation in non-shivering thermogenesis generated
by brown adipose tissue ( Brown adipose tissue thermogenesis heats brain and body as part of the brain coordinated
ultradian basic rest activity cycle et al., 2009)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood
The genetic basis for adaptation to the climate-mediated selection was elucidated in a recent scan of
the human genome using 61 worldwide populations (Adaptations to climate mediated selective pressures in humans et
al., 2011)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related Behaviors
I hypothesize that the CRY1 and CRY2 proteins play this key role in brown adipose tissue, similar
to their role in other tissues analyzed so far, where CRY1 (and possibly CRY2 as well) after
the encoding gene being induced by melatonin ( Molecular characterization of the long day response in the
Soay sheep a seasonal mammal et al., 2004) might mediate the inhibitory effect of melatonin on cyclic
adenosine monophosphate reactions in brown adipocytesHypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood
The proteins encoded by the cryptochrome genes ( Hsu et al., 1996) are likely to be of key importance here,
because of their unique role in the core of circadian transcriptional feedback loops ( Hirota et al., 2012;Feedback regulation of
transcriptional termination by the mammalian circadian clock PERIOD complex et al., 2012), via their interaction with 5 -AMP-activated protein kinase
(Um et al., 2011; for review, see Jordan and Lamia, 2012) whose activity in turn controls the activity of brown
adipocytes ( Lpez et al., 2010)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related Behaviors
It appears that a non-transcriptional pathway for the metabolic cycle engages the circadian clock, thereby
enhancing clock performance (Where clocks are redundant weak circadian mechanisms in reindeer living under polar
photic conditions, 2012)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and
Under the short photoperiod the melatonin signal is not sufficient to inhibit the cyclic adenosine monophosphate
response during the second half of the night (A physiological model of a circannual oscillator, 2008),
but adenosine elicits through the melatonin-sensitized adenosine A 2b receptor an increase in the transcription of
cyclic adenosine monophosphate-inducible genes (von Gall et al., 2002), which characterizes the so-called sleep-sensitive circadian period
of the individualHypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related
On the other hand, cryptochromes directly take part in glucocorticoid-receptor-mediated repression of glucocorticoid synthesis (Lamia et al., 2011),
and in blockade of the NF-B signaling pathway ( Circadian clock protein cryptochrome regulates the expression of proinflammatory
cytokines et al., 2012)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related Behaviors
ONCE BEING ACTIVATED BROWN FAT IS NOT EASILY QUENCHEDBrown adipose tissue may in fact be an active pacemaker
tissue, having activity in a range of ultradian ( Ootsuka et al., 2009) to infradian ( Seasonal variation
in the effect of constant ambient temperature of 24 C in reducing FDG uptake by brown adipose tissue
in children et al., 2010) oscillationsHypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and
This effect can be achieved directly through interaction of the CRY1 and CRY2 proteins with the G
s  subunit of heterotrimeric G protein ( Cryptochrome mediates circadian regulation of cAMP signaling and hepatic
gluconeogenesis et al., 2010) or that of CRY1 (and possibly CRY2 as well) with adenylyl cyclase (
Narasimamurthy et al., 2012)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related
Changes in the cellular metabolic state could be the cause, not just the result, of
neuronal activity ( Circadian rhythm of redox state regulates excitability in suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons et
al., 2012), and if this holds true, then the ultradian rhythms in brown adipose tissue
may lead neuronal activityHypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood
It is currently evident that brown adipose tissue is a highly active tissue, rather than only
"a form of embryonic adipose tissue" (Sheldon, 1924) or the so-called hibernating gland, and it is
highly prevalent in adult humans ( High prevalence of brown adipose tissue in adult humans et
al., 2011)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related Behaviors
It is strengthened further by those which show that the CRY2 gene expression is abnormal when inbred-strain
mice with the intrinsic level of high anxiety are deprived of sleep ( Sleep deprivation effects on
circadian clock gene expression in the cerebral cortex parallel electroencephalographic differences among mouse strains et al., 2008),
and when humans with bipolar type 1 disorder do remain depressed after the antidepressant sleep deprivation (Lavebratt
et al., 2010).If both CRY1 and CRY2 feedback loops are intact, the nuclear ratio of CRY1 to
CRY2 proteins controls the period of the circadian clock, more CRY1 causing longer periods and more CRY2
causing shorter periods ( Hirota et al., 2012)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and
On the other hand, cryptochromes directly take part in glucocorticoid-receptor-mediated repression of glucocorticoid synthesis (Cryptochromes mediate rhythmic
repression of the glucocorticoid receptor et al., 2011), and in blockade of the NF-B signaling pathway (
Narasimamurthy et al., 2012)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related
This may be relevant if one takes a scenario where there is a link between the
circadian clock to cold tolerance (or heat tolerance) and alternative splicing is used to fine-tune the
individual's responses to the environment, similar to that in fruit flies (How a circadian clock adapts
to seasonal decreases in temperature and day length et al., 1999) or in plants ( Seo
et al., 2012)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related
Furthermore, it is not yet known how mutated CRY2 proteins ( Generation of a novel allelic

Currently, there are no longitudinal data on the same individuals assessed with the same method available, except from a cohort
study in which 190 twins were followed-up for 5 years ( Heritability of diurnal type a nationwide study of 8753

However, there are gaps of knowledge, as the impact of melatonin on transcription of CRY1 ( Hazlerigg
et al., 2004;MacGregor and Lincoln, 2008), the roles of PER2 and CRY1 as a systematically driven genes
that bear a signal of time in a correct phase throughout the tissues ( System driven and
oscillator dependent et al., 2007;Hughes et al., 2012), and the cryptochrome-independent influence of the PER2 protein on
transcription of the ARNTL (BMAL1) gene ( Schmutz et al., 2010;Ye et al., 2011) are not yet
understood in depth.Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related Behaviors
However, this view might not be far-fetched, since thus far all the health hazards assessed appear to cluster
and be more frequent among the evening-types, including unhealthy dietary habits ( Kanerva et al., 2012), smoking and
nicotine dependence ( Broms et al., 2012), and the increased odds for depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders
( Reid et al., 2012), insomnia ( Relation of chronotype to sleep complaints in the general Finnish population
et al., 2012a), hypertension, and type 2 diabetesHypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect
Similarly, data on the core clock gene encoded proteins (for review, see Molecular components of the mammalian circadian
clock  2006) suggest and I speculate here that the nuclear ratio of RORA to RORB may control
the period of the circadian clock, more RORA causing longer periods and more RORB leading to shorter periods
(for review, see Partonen, 2012)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related
Normally, natural environmental light and ambient temperature of the external 24 h cycle act together to dictate
the phase and to entrain circadian clocks ( Boothroyd et al., 2007), but the change of seasons
tends to challenge their functions, and therefore, for example, in plants the lengthened period serves to delay
the onset of flowering until later in the season, and it could prove advantageous in avoiding the
late-spring light but cold weather ( Enhanced fitness conferred by naturally occurring variation in the circadian clock
et al., 2003)Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and Brown Fat are Essential for Adaptation and Affect Mood and Mood-Related Behaviors
Furthermore, there is an ultradian rhythm of e.g., free corticosterone in the blood ( Qian et al.,
2012;Ultradian corticosterone secretion is maintained in the absence of circadian cues et al., 2012) that translates into
synchronized rhythms of free glucocorticoid hormone in peripheral (the subcutaneous tissue) and central (the hippocampus) tissues (Qian

While recent studies [Parkinson syndrome Heterogeneity of etiology40] might further help to clarify this controversy, by adding new
concepts to the debate, our concluding remark would be focused to a simple take home message: the appropriate
examination and investigation of patients with tremor should not be simply addressed to motor aspects but should also
consider non-motor features and specifically the core and supportive features of DLB [1][2][3] i.e., cognitive, visuo-spatial and dysexecutive
abnormalities, RBD, and EEG abnormalities, before reaching definite conclusions.Cohort study of prevalence and phenomenology of tremor in dementia

IntroductionOver the past decade, a lively debate has developed regarding the decline in civic participation observed by some, but not

The importance of this debate lies not only in establishing whether Western societies have become more individualistic
over time and its citizens increasingly 'hunker down' (to borrow the colloquialism introduced in this respect by

central role often attributed to civic engagement for the development and maintenance of democratic values, generalized trust,

Wars, terrorist activity or natural disasters therefore have the potential to induce sudden, although possibly temporary, shifts in

Why does this relative neglect of the socio-political and institutional environment matter? Based on the idea
that institutions get 'locked in' as a result of selfreinforcement, self-reproduction and path dependence (e.g., Collier
&amp; Collier, 1991;Mahoney, 2000;Path dependence increasing returns and the study of politics, 2000), institutions have long

1997;Schofer &amp; Fourcade-Gourinchas, 2001;Kriinen &amp; Lehtonen, 2006), it is surprising that both lines of argument ignore the socio-political and institutional

Using this terminology, connected memberships are argued to expand individuals' networks beyond one single association (Paxton,
2007; see also Structural cohesion and embeddedness A hierarchical concept of social groups &amp; White, 2003;Cornwell

the association' (Paxton, 2007, pAssociation Membership and Generalized Trust: Are Connections between Associations Losing their Value?
Although such endogenous incremental changes can take different forms (see Streeck &amp; Thelen, 2005;Boas, 2007;A theory of gradual

Therefore, we assess three key assumptions underlying bioclimatic envelope models: (1) that species' distributions are largely governed by
climate (Ara ujo &amp; Predicting the geography of species invasions via ecological niche modeling, 2012), (2) that a
species' current native distribution corresponds with the total set of climate conditions under which it can persist (Petereson,

In lieu of direct respiratory measures, established algorithms ( Moody et al., 1985Moody et al., , 1986) that
have been successively improved (e.g., Park et al., 2008;Principal component analysis as a tool for analyzing beat to
beat changes in ECG features application to ECG derived respiration et al., 2010) can also provide an appropriate
surrogate measure of respiration from based on ECG signal morphologyConsiderations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
Indeed, cardiorespiratory interaction has been variously quantified as primarily respiration-to-heart rate (Rosenblum et al., 2002;Zhu et al.,
2013) heart rate-to-respiration ( Larsen et al., 1999;Cardioventilatory coupling in resting human subjects et al., 2003) or
neither (i.e., bidirectional; Porta et al., 2013)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research
Water consumption has also been shown to increase HF-HRV in particular ( Cardiac vagal response to water
ingestion in normal human subjects et al., 2002), due to the vagal buffering response to the pressor
effect provoked by hypo-osmotic fluids (Scott et al., 2001)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
In addition, basal respiratory frequency has a non-linear relationship with spectral power as breathing rate falls below approximately
0.15 Hz (as it occasionally does in athletes; The breathing effect of the LF HF ratio in the
heart rate variability measurements of athletes et al., 2014)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral
Consequently, the typically functioning respiratory system is presently characterized by complex breath-to-breath variations in respiratory rate and
depth (Temporal variations in the pattern of breathing, 1996) coupled with both heart period and blood pressure
oscillations in a network of continual co-modificationConsiderations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research
Few papers ideally control for medication, food, and water consumption, bladder filling, time of
day, and other extraneous factors (Tak et al., 2009;Everything Hertz methodological issues in short
term frequency domain HRV, 2014)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral
While removing slow or DC trends from short periods of HRV will create a quasi-stationary series
(e.g., Tarvainen et al., 2002), HRV in general displays the characteristics of a non-linear signal, given
the biological origin and the origin of HRV deriving from sum of processes that operate on
a variety of time scales (Winfree, 2001;Geometry of the Poincar plot of RR intervals and its
asymmetry in healthy adults and Guzik, 2007;Stein et al., 2008)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate
Poincar plots have been demonstrated to shown to display significant asymmetry in approximately 80% of individuals (Heart rate asymmetry
by Poincar plots of RR intervals et al., 2006;;Porta et al., 2008), with the plot "cloud" above the identity
line appearing larger than the plot cloud below the lineConsiderations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral
There are major biobehavioral theories that suggest that HRV can be used to investigate the central relationship
between autonomic regulation and interpersonal interaction (Orienting in a defensive world mammalian modifications of our evolutionary heritage
A polyvagal theory, 1995;Thayer and Lane, 2000)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research
To wit, by controlling for breathing in HRV recordings the researcher is removing an important
influence on HRV (but see Toward understanding respiratory sinus arrhythmia relations to cardiac vagal tone
evolution and biobehavioral functions and Taylor, 2007)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
However, here sympathetic outflow was indexed by normalized low frequency HRV -which is not straightforwardly related
to SNS activity (e.g., Grassi and Esler, 1999;Moak et al., 2007;Goedhart et al., 2008;The LF HF
ratio does not accurately measure cardiac sympatho vagal balance, 2011The LF HF ratio does not accurately
measure cardiac sympatho vagal balance, , 2013a) -so this latter claim requires further empirical support using
indices that more directly index cardiac sympathetic outflow.Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
While it may be the case that HRV can be used as a neurobiological index
of interpersonal interaction, significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV and consequently
uncertainty regarding what information is actually provided by common HRV indices ( Berntson et al.,
1997;Malpas, 2002;Heart rate variability a historical perspective, 2011)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability
Indeed, to appropriately detect a difference between groups, a sample size between 30 and 77,
depending on the HRV metric used, is needed ( Heart rate variability measures a fresh
look at reliability et al., 2007)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral
Moreover, the mental stress that usually accompanies these tasks can also disorder general
respiratory coordination ( A sigh following sustained attention and mental stress effects on
respiratory variability et al., 2012b)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
THE IMPACT OF RESPIRATION DURING SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL TASKSSocial-emotional tasks have been shown to reduce breathing variability (Sigh rate and
respiratory variability during mental load and sustained attention et al) , even for positively valenced emotions (Boiten, 1998),
due to the "locked-in" attention often required during social-emotional tasksConsiderations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
Indeed, cardiorespiratory interaction has been variously quantified as primarily respiration-to-heart rate (Rosenblum et al., 2002;Zhu et
al., 2013) heart rate-to-respiration ( Cardioventilatory coupling effects of IPPV et al., 1999;Tzeng et al., 2003)
or neither (i.e., bidirectional; Porta et al., 2013)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
For instance, a breathing rate of 5-6 breaths per minute corresponds with a phase angle increase of
90  , continuing to a phase angle of 180  with 10 breaths per minute (Respiratory
sinus arrhythmia a frequency dependent phenomenon and Coulter, 1964)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
Intriguingly, the degree of coupling may be higher when HRV is increased and at lower breathing
frequencies ( Cardioventilatory coupling in heart rate variability methods for qualitative and quantitative determination and Larsen,
2001;Tzeng et al., 2003), suggesting that unhealthy populations or experiments that are designed to reduce HRV
may be more prone to decoupling of cardiorespiratory oscillationsConsiderations in the assessment of heart rate variability
Indeed, cardiorespiratory interaction has been variously quantified as primarily respiration-to-heart rate (Rosenblum et al., 2002;Zhu et al., 2013) heart
rate-to-respiration ( Larsen et al., 1999;Tzeng et al., 2003) or neither (i.e., bidirectional; Cardiovascular control and time domain Granger
causality insights from selective autonomic blockade et al., 2013)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research
Nevertheless, it is possible to mathematically correct for the influence of the prevailing HR on HRV (Sacha,
2013;Effect of heart rate correction on pre and post exercise heart rate variability to predict risk of
mortality an experimental study on the FINCAVAS cohort et al., 2014), which may also improve the reproducibility
of HRV ( Sacha et al., 2013).Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research
Consistent with this theory, reduced HRV has been observed in psychiatric disorders characterized by poor social cognition and emotion
regulation ( Br et al., 2007;A Meta analysis on the impact of alcohol dependence on short term resting state

While this model is still popular, it is directly at odds with a great deal of available evidence; for
instance, that neuropeptide Y directly mediates transmission between adrenergic and muscarinic neurons (Sympathetic parasympathetic interactions at the heart possibly
involving neuropeptide Y in anaesthetized dogs and McCloskey, 1990)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research
Poincar plots have been demonstrated to shown to display significant asymmetry in approximately 80% of individuals
(Guzik et al., 2006;Piskorski and Guzik, 2007;Temporal asymmetries of short term heart period variability are linked
to autonomic regulation et al., 2008), with the plot "cloud" above the identity line appearing larger
than the plot cloud below the lineConsiderations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral
Indeed, cardiorespiratory interaction has been variously quantified as primarily respiration-to-heart rate (Identification of coupling direction application to
cardiorespiratory interaction et al., 2002;Zhu et al., 2013) heart rate-to-respiration ( Larsen et al., 1999;Tzeng et al.,
2003) or neither (i.e., bidirectional; Porta et al., 2013)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
Finally, continual focused attention (e.g., during psychometrics tasks) has been shown in a number of studies ( Mulder
and Mulder, 1981;Operator effort and the measurement of heart rate variability et al., 1987;Middleton et al., 1999) to
reduce LF HRV, which creates further difficulties for interpretationConsiderations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral
A popular alternative to complete rest is the Vanilla baseline (Jennings et al., 1992), which requires subjects
to perform a trivial counting task requiring sustained attention but minimal cognitive load, as opposed to what
the authors term "enforced relaxation." Other similar approaches have been attempted (e.g., An alternative approach for achieving
cardiovascular baseline viewing an aquatic video et al., 2000)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
Additionally, the relationship between HRV and vagal modulation is complex in itself with a large
interindividual variation ( Incongruous changes in heart period and heart rate variability with vagotonic atropine
implications for rehabilitation medicine et al., 2009)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
In addition, both bladder and gastric distension can also have an appreciable influence on HRV; these have been associated
with increases in blood pressure and sympathetic outflow (Fagius and Karhuvaara, 1989;Stomach distension increases efferent muscle sympathetic nerve activity
and blood pressure in healthy humans et al., 1998)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research
While this approach has utility during resting state registration, this procedure may inadvertently influence HRV during emotional
or cognitive tasks as the participant has to consciously follow the pacing cue, in addition to paying
attention to the experimental task -dual attention, in a number of contexts, significantly increases task difficulty (Dual
task interference in simple tasks data and theory, 1994)Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in
In lieu of direct respiratory measures, established algorithms ( Moody et al., 1985Moody et al., , 1986) that
have been successively improved (e.g., An improved algorithm for respiration signal extraction from electrocardiogram measured by conductive textile
electrodes using instantaneous frequency estimation et al., 2008;Langley et al., 2010) can also provide an appropriate surrogate measure
of respiration from based on ECG signal morphology.Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research

Likewise, recent interest in data uploading and retention (e.g., Scientific utopia II Restructuring incentives and practices to promote truth
over publishability et al., 2012) has received little systematic attention in cardiac psychophysiology so far, even though a) data
retention is a American Psychological Association requirement (American psychological association [APA], 2001) and b) the ability to broadly access
raw data is a potentially excellent control for the methodological and analytical issues outlined here, as well as a
test bed for the development of future HRV metrics and meta-analysis.Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in

Thus, variable selection is useful to discard irrelevant time lags, leading to simpler models that are easier to interpret
and that usually give better performances [Time Series Forecasting by Evolutionary Neural Networks9,6]Evolutionary Support Vector Machines for Time Series
More recently, several Computational Intelligence (CI) methods have been applied to TSF, such as Artificial Neural

want to consume, Liquidity Provision Banking and the Allocation of Interest Rate Risk (1994a) shows that it
is optimal to have an arrangement where people stipulate the amounts of short-term and long-term assets that
they want to hold, with the proviso that, if they find that they want to consume early,
they should bear the interest-induced valuation risk of long-term investments, and, if they want to consume late,

Partly in an attempt to overcome this problem, and partly in recognition of the fact that it is likely that
not all values of sensitivity or specificity will be regarded as relevant, various researchers have proposed the use of the
partial AUC, PAUC, in which the integration in (3) is not over the entire range of sensitivity (or specificity),but over
some interval [ ] , a b within [ ] 0,1 , regarded as of particular relevance (see, for example,
Analyzing a portion of the ROC curve)Evaluating diagnostic tests: the area under the ROC curve and the balance of errors
Incidentally, it has been pointed out in Overestimation of the receiver operating characteristic curve for logistic regression that
estimates of the area under the ROC curve based on the data used to derive the score function
will tend to be optimistically biasedEvaluating diagnostic tests: the area under the ROC curve and the balance of
Although the AUC has been criticised on various methodological grounds (see, for example, [Use and misuse
of the receiver operating characteristic curve in risk prediction16]) this interpretation suggests that it also has
a core theoretical weakness, at least when viewed from some perspectives.To overcome this problem with the
AUC, we proposed an alternative measure, which fixes the distribution of the relative severity of the
consequences of the two kinds of misdiagnosisEvaluating diagnostic tests: the area under the ROC curve and

Therefore, managers should consider concentrating efforts on understanding their customers, closely monitoring their perceptions about the company, and devoting attention
to accommodating their individual requirements (Doing good and doing better despite negative information The role of corporate social responsibility in
consumer resistance to negative information, Rubera, Seifert, &amp; Bhardwaj, 2011)Examining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis
The present study builds on the existing literature that underscores the value of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) (e.g.,

thinking in data analysis and crafting theory, 2013;Moving beyond multiple regression analysis to algorithms Calling for adoption of a

the proposed methodological tool offers much in terms of understanding causal relationships, by virtue of providing information that is
unique in comparison with the information conventional correlational methods provideExamining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
As such, fsQCA is a proficient tool that helps supplement traditional correlational analyses in three main ways: (1) asymmetry
(i.e., the relationships between independent and dependent variables are treated as not symmetric), (2) equifinality (i.e., multiple pathways and
solutions lead to the same outcome), and (3) causal complexity (i.e., combinations of causal antecedent conditions lead to the
outcome, and thus the researcher focuses not on the estimation of independent net effects but on the estimation of
combinatorial effects) (Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis An introduction, 2013)Examining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
The present study builds on the existing literature that underscores the value of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) (e.g.,
Building better causal theories A fuzzy set approach to typologies in organization research, 2011;Woodside, 2013;Woodside &amp; Zhang, 2013) and
shows that the proposed methodological tool offers much in terms of understanding causal relationships, by virtue of providing information
that is unique in comparison with the information conventional correlational methods provideExamining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzy-set
First, from a methodological perspective, the study demonstrates the value of complex combinatorial fsQCA and the advantages of
this technique over traditional correlational methods; that is, fsQCA enables examination of different configurations of conditions that give
rise to an outcome of interest (Ganter &amp; Hecker, 2013;Industry growth and the knowledge spillover regime Does outsourcing
harm innovativeness but help profit &amp; Olleros, 2013)Examining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis
For example, in contrast with correlational techniques, which attempt to estimate the net effect of an
independent variable on an outcome variable, fsQCA attempts to identify the conditions that lead to a
given outcome ( Mapping the institutional capital of high tech firms A fuzzy set analysis of
capitalist variety and export performance et al., 2010)Examining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzy-set qualitative
Thus, the complex solution, which makes no assumptions, is the most appropriate; prior research highly recommends this solution
especially when the number of causal antecedent conditions is not large (Elliott, 2013;Between complexity and parsimony Limited diversity

Many disciplines discuss skepticism, including politics (e.g., Motivated skepticism in the evaluation of political
beliefs &amp; Lodge, 2006), philosophy (e.g., McGrath, 2011), sociology (e.g., Freudenburg, Gramling, &amp; Davidson,

If multicollinearity is high, the regression estimator becomes inefficient and may yield statistically non-significant estimates or
estimates inconsistent with the supposed associations (e.g., Using regression analysis to model the performance of UK

Corporate wrongdoing attracts the attention of the media and watchdog organizations, triggering questions about why companies engage in

inconsistent corporate social responsibility perceptions, Lutz, &amp; Weitz, 2009)Examining the role of CSR skepticism using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
However, multicollinearity (i.e., significant correlations among the independent variables) is common, especially in cases
with a large number of independent variables (e.g., Mittal, Ross, &amp; Baldasare, 1998;The measurement

For example, Woodside (2013) stresses that relationships are rarely linear and are better explained by "tipping
points." In other words, a change in an independent variable may have little or no impact
on a dependent variable, until this change reaches a certain threshold (The tipping point How little

possible ways to contribute to gender equality ( Becker and Swim, 2011;Reducing the Endorsement of Sexism Using Experiential Learning:

Hence, according to this account, which emphasizes the role of the hippocampus as the sparring partner
of the neocortex, sleep has the potential to make memories more accessible.In contrast, theories grounded in
the notion of retroactive interference (The psychology and neuroscience of forgetting, 2004; see also Mednick, Cai,
Shuman, Anagnostaras, &amp; The psychology and neuroscience of forgetting, 2011) insist that during slow-wave sleep synaptic
plasticity in the hippocampus is nullSleep not just protects memories against forgetting, it also makes them
However, as Intratrial and intertrial retention Notes towards a theory of free recall verbal learning (1964Intratrial and intertrial retention
Notes towards a theory of free recall verbal learning ( , 1967, amongst others, pointed out, this approach is
inherently blind to fluctuations at the item-levelSleep not just protects memories against forgetting, it also makes them more accessible
By testing recall after intervals ranging between one and eight hours, these researchers found that the presence of sleep in
the retention interval had a protective influence: forgetting curves were less steep for intervals filled with sleep than for those
filled with active wake.Nine decades down the forgetting curves, the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established (see
Memory consolidation &amp; Cai, 2014, for a review)Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting, it also makes them more accessible
Thus, on the basis of these non-linear changes, we know that for the sleep group something
akin to systems consolidation had been triggered (e.g., Shift from hippocampal to neocortical centered retrieval network
with consolidation et al., 2009).Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting, it also makes them more
Given this concern, I re-analyzed the data from two published studies (Dumay &amp; Gaskell, 2007;Sleep spindle activity is
associated with the integration of new memories and existing knowledge, Payne, Stickgold, Wamsley, &amp; Gaskell, 2010;henceforth 'DG' and
'TPSWG'), that showed a positive effect of sleep on free recall under conditions in which performance was not
constrained by the ceiling (or the floor)Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting, it also makes them more
According to the "active consolidation" account ( Diekelmann &amp; Born, 2010), sleep is key to
memory consolidation because slow-wave sleep promotes "neural replay" (Reactivation of hippocampal ensemble memories during sleep
&amp; McNaughton, 1994)Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting, it also makes them more accessible
To summarise, what can be witnessed is that, in line with institutional theory ( DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;Escape
from the iron cage organizational change and isomorphic pressures in the public sector et al., 2009;Lai et al.,

Respondents from the municipalities reported that perceptions of persuasive pressure were followed by organisational searching and scanning activities, through which
municipalities attempted to seek, identify and choose relevant knowledge, experiences and courses of action (see also Levinthal and March, 1982;Managing

A supposed characteristic of the 'final stage' in these maturity models is that there is a seamless
integration of information services across administrative boundaries.Recently, the idea of integration was further pushed by it being
given strong support (OECD, 2009) and the related academic discussion of personalised integrated services (Transformational government The

According to Circulating ideas Imitation translation and editing and Wedlin (2008;see also Silva and Hirscheim, 2007),
and in line with the Scandinavian Institutionalism mentioned in the discussion on theoretical antecedents of diffusion,
knowledge and ideas cannot simply be transfused from one organisation to the other: rather, ideas, concepts
and knowledge has to be repackaged and re-embedded (Isabella, 1990;MacDonald, 1995;Circulating ideas Imitation translation and editing

These include socio-political problems of information sharing across traditional organisational boundaries (Mulgan, 2005;Understanding E government Information systems in public

Advancements in the discipline of organisational sociology in recent decades, such as the emergence of 'new
institutionalism' (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983;The Institutionalization of Institutional Theory and Zucker, 1996), have highlighted the significance
of the professional and/or legal rules, cognitive structures, norms and the prevailing values in which innovation
takes placeDiffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities: evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local
In order to be able to explain the diffusion, we focus on a population of 441 potential adopters in a
single national jurisdiction, the Netherlands, which can be seen as a decentralised unitary state (Esping-Andersen, 1990;Public management reform A comparative
analysis and Bouckaert, 2004)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities: evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies

Our hope is that, by focusing on 'agency' alongside 'structure' (Orlikowksi and Barley, 2001), more light will be shed

Social integration mechanisms: translating and framing by actorsFrom fieldwork observations, and informed by our theoretical discussion of
Scandinavian Institutionalism, we could see that translation, transfusion and repackaging of knowledge and ideas does not take
place in a vacuum, but is a social integration process in which specific actors play a role

and maintenance of electronic services (van The challenge of coordination Coordinating integrated electronic service delivery in Denmark and

Institutionalism holds that the adoption of innovations does not take place because individuals or (private as well
as public) organisations make rational, calculated decisions regarding costs and benefits (see, for instance, User acceptance of
information technology Toward a unified view et al., 2003), but rather that:(1) decisions whether or not to
adopt innovations are influenced by rules, conventions, principles, belief systems and social context criteria, and (2) attempt
to shape and affect these overarching structures of norms, beliefs and rules that together form the concept
of institutions.Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities: evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government
Recently, the idea of integration was further pushed by it being given strong support (OECD, 2009)

Innovation through mimicry is likely to occur when innovations are socially visible (Mahajan and Peterson, 1985;Dos Santos and
Peffers, 1998), when causes, conditions and consequences are known (absence of causal ambiguity, Barney, 1991;Diffusion of information technology
outsourcing influence sources and the Kodak effect and Venkatraman, 1992) and when the success of the innovation is
unlikely to be determined by path dependencies (Barney, 1991;Diffusion of information technology outsourcing influence sources and the Kodak

Various authors have argued that various 'stages' or 'levels of maturity' can be discerned in electronic service

Second, the resource based view on the firm (The competitive challenge strategies for industrial innovation and renewal,

According to Sahlin and Wedlin (2008;see also Silva and Hirscheim, 2007), and in line with the
Scandinavian Institutionalism mentioned in the discussion on theoretical antecedents of diffusion, knowledge and ideas cannot simply
be transfused from one organisation to the other: rather, ideas, concepts and knowledge has to be
repackaged and re-embedded (Isabella, 1990; Learning to change an information perspective on learning in the organization,

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the reality of carrying out benefit-cost analysis of federal regulations falls short of best practice, and it does
not appear to be having a significant impact on many regulatory decisions, except higher-profile cases (Has economic analysis improved regulatory

I will define these two terms in the sense introduced by Risk Uncertainty and Profit (1921), whereby the distinction
turns on whether states of nature can be assigned precise probabilities 3 (risk) or not (uncertainty, or, as it
is often known nowadays, ambiguity)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory
In the present context, this means that the decision-maker focuses more on models yielding higher
estimates of the SCC (see also Ambiguity and climate policy, Dietz and Heal 2010)The Treatment
of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis
Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met, while the existence of
a long-run quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the
efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty (The Economics of Climate Change The Stern
Review 2007)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for
4 Having said that, even if we only had one model at our disposal, it would be natural to
question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty, and the answer in the case of physical forecasts
of future climate (and by implication economic forecasts) would have to be in the negative (What might we learn
from climate forecasts 2002)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact
This seems remarkable, since, for example, such temperatures are likely to test the limits
of human physiology (An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress 2010)The

To take the DICE model as an example (Warming the World Economic Models of Global Warming ), it
can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature, together with the
modellers' specific coefficient values, implies that global warming can reach more than 18C before the equivalent of 50%
of global GDP is lostThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for

model, applying a functional form proposed by GHG targets as insurance against catastrophic climate damages

Furthermore, they also question the damage estimates of the models at low temperatures, drawing on work by Michael

Using recent reviews of the literature, we concluded that the range of estimates of the present SCC was
a factor of ten larger than the corresponding range of estimates of the present MAC ( Environmental prices

However, in the long run, with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change, the opposite seems to hold: marginal
benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO2, while marginal costs are fairly flat.This target-driven approach to
carbon pricing is now being followed in the UK (Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) 2008), after several
years of (mixed) experience in using the SCC (beginning with Estimating the social cost of carbon emissions Government Economic

With some trepidation, I will do likewise.In outlining the second assumption, note that simple averaging runs counter to most
economic research on ambiguity, which shows that individuals are averse to ambiguity (as summarised in Recent development in modeling

The semantic halo (Lewis, 1967) of the word "outcomes"For many outside any health service it would seem axiomatic

data is (and will remain) the main source of data (e.g., the growing number of genomes available through
international sequencing projects) for addressing these and similar problems [Learning oncogenetic networks by reducing to mixed integer linear
programming,12]Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary models, and
Virtually all papers that try to infer order restrictions, including methodological papers, rely on simple frequency-based
selection or filtering procedures to select which genes to use [6,15,18,22,[32][33]Quantifying cancer progression with conjunctive Bayesian
networks[35][36], but the effects of these filtering approaches on the performance of the methods to infer

Mixtures of OTs [A global structural EM algorithm for a model of cancer progression] and mixtures

Another early model are distancebased trees [Maximum likelihood estimation of oncogenetic tree models,18], but their meaning is rather different,
since the observed mutations are only placed in the leaves or terminal nodes of the tree, and the internal
nodes are unobserved and unknown events, which precludes an interpretation in terms of order restrictions like "mutation A is
required for mutation B"Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary

Passenger mutations can show a nonnegligible frequency because they "hitchhike" on drivers [Clonal evolution in cancer,30]Identifying restrictions
in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary models, and sampling
What about mutations in driver genes that do not have their dependencies satisfied? Enforcing monotonicity is equivalent to considering
such a mutation as a mutation in an essential housekeeping gene, which can be modeled setting s h ,
in the notation of [Modelling the evolution of genetic instability during tumour progression], to  (so fitness of such
clones is zero)Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary models,
Note that the implementations I used to infer CBN and OT incorporate errors [6,31,32] and the OT
model explicitly allows for errors due to the occurrence of genetic events outside the model implied by

BackgroundCancer progression is caused by the sequential accumulation of somatic mutations, including changes in copy number (structural variants), single
nucleotides (SNP variants) and DNA methylation patterns during the life of an individual Cancer as an evolutionary and ecological
process[2][3]Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary models, and sampling
Of particular interest is monotonicity (a mutation in a driver gene can only be observed if
the preceding parent mutations in the graph have occurred), because deviations from it can easily arise
when a mutation behaves as a driver or as a passenger depending on the genetic context

Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (CBNs) [Conjunctive Bayesian networks] were developed as a generalization of OTs: these are graphs where
the occurrence of a mutation can depend on the occurrence of two or more parents (i.e., a conjunction).Identifying

The other three are measures of classification or diagnostic performance common in medical testing and machine learning [The relationship

There is a rich literature about tumor progression models that focuses on the consequences of drivers, passengers, and variation
in selection pressures [Evolutionary dynamics of tumor progression with random fitness values,41,42,44,70,71], and a largely separate body of work
[13][14][15]19,21,31,32,45] that deals with understanding the restrictions and order of accumulation of mutations (but see [6] for a connection
between the  i of CBNs and selection coefficients, in the context of the Fisher-Wright model of tumor progression

The results of [Stability analysis of mixtures of mutagenetic trees of course highlight that if different subjects have
different sets of order restrictions, then no single OT will capture these patterns, a limitation that is already
recognized in the early literature on ongenetic trees [14,15], and that has prompted the development of mixtures of
oncogenetic trees [24,25,72]Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary

Incorporating order restrictions within evolutionary models would also allow us to address two questions of immediate practical

The brain activations related to these tasks have been previously described (When thoughts become actions

In the same way that visual imagery and visual perception recruit similar brain regions ( Brain areas underlying

More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane
potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact
and control the K(+) channel KC1 ( A novel motif essential for SNARE interaction with
the K channel KC1 and channel gating in Arabidopsis et al., 2010).Defining new SNARE functions:
Additional structural roles for t-SNAREs cannot be excluded.Recently we observed for Arabidopsis SYP51 and SYP52
a double localization associated to two different functions (AtSYP51 52 functions diverge in the post
golgi traffic and differently affect vacuolar sorting et al., 2012)Defining new SNARE functions: the i-SNARE
This consideration was first formulated by Endosomal fusion upon SNARE knockdown is maintained by residual SNARE
activity and enhanced docking and co-workers upon analysis of a rich literature showing that knockdown of
some SNARE genes have little effect on endomembranes ( Endosomal fusion upon SNARE knockdown is maintained

Tyrrell and co-workers ( Tyrrell et al., 2007) found that the soluble DN variant of SYP21 in
Arabidopsis thaliana blocks traffic of TIP1:1-YFP chimera to the tonoplast but, it has been also demonstrated that
over-expression of SYP21 inhibited PVCto-vacuole traffic in vivo ( Overexpression of the Arabidopsis syntaxin PEP12 SYP21 inhibits
transport from the prevacuolar compartment to the lytic vacuole in vivo et al., 2006).Defining new SNARE functions:
Also in Petunia hybrida, the single SYP51 gene cloned up to now (Faraco, 2011) seems to define in petal
epidermal cells a very well defined vacuolar compartments separated from the central vacuole and already observed with other vacuolar
markers ( Agrobacteriummediated transient expression of vacuolar GFPs in Petunia leaves and petals et al., 2008).Defining new SNARE functions:
From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast, it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to
different V-ATPase subunits, influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting, or inhibiting, the lipid
reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore (The V ATPase proteolipid cylinder promotes the
lipid mixing stage of SNARE dependent fusion of yeast vacuoles et al., 2011)Defining new SNARE functions:
Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the
cellular response ( Asymmetric localization of Arabidopsis SYP124 syntaxin at the pollen tube apical and sub apical
zones is involved in tip growth et al., 2010;Yang et al., 2012)Defining new SNARE functions: the i-SNARE
Vesicles do not preferentially target these microdomains.Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain protein clustering in micro-domains
and the t-SNARE distribution seems to depend both on lipidic and proteic contributions ( Secretory vesicles are
preferentially targeted to areas of low molecular SNARE density et al., 2012)Defining new SNARE functions: the i-SNARE
The recent investigation of SYP5s i-SNARE effect (De Benedictis et al., 2012) may help to discover the
molecular mechanisms of this process.A mechanism for the i-SNARE effect of yeast Qc-SNAREs is described by the
competition between endosomal (Tlg1 and Syn8) and vacuolar form (Vam7) of the proteins ( Distinct contributions of
vacuolar Qabcand R SNARE proteins to membrane fusion specificity et al., 2012) and because of their ability
to interact with V-ATPase subunits influencing membrane potential (Strasser et al., 2011)Defining new SNARE functions: the i-SNARE
SNARE ABUNDANCE AND INFLUENCE OF DISTRIBUTION ON THEIR FUSOGENIC ROLESNAREs are relatively small polypeptides (200-400-amino-acids) characterized
by the presence of a particular domain, the SNARE motif ( SNAREs engines for membrane fusion
and Scheller, 2006), consisting of heptad repeats that can form a coiled-coil structureDefining new SNARE functions:
Overexpression of DN variants to inhibit specific functions seems to offer a better tool to affect
the molecular machinery leaving no options to the plant cell to adapt and mask the effect
( Rehman et al., 2008;Silva et al., 2010;Protein trafficking to the cell wall occurs through mechanisms
distinguishable from default sorting in tobacco et al., 2011;De Benedictis et al., 2012).Defining new SNARE functions:
These have been proposed to belong to a new functional class of SNAREs ( i SNAREs inhibitory

also demonstrated that over-expression of SYP21 inhibited PVCto-vacuole traffic in vivo ( Foresti et al., 2006).Defining new SNARE functions:
It is extremely interesting a recent report on SNAREs interaction with proteolipid (V ATPase membrane

Little attention is generally paid to the need of the cell to keep very similar compartments
separated, because this need may not be evident among endosomes as much as among larger vacuolar
structures typical of only few plant cells ( Two functionally different vacuoles for static and dynamic
purposes in one plant mesophyll leaf cell et al., 2004;Verweij et al., 2008)Defining new SNARE functions:
The equilibrium between fusogenic (tSNARE) and non fusogenic (i-SNARE) activity of specific SNAREs may reside on their localization, as
highlighted for SYP51 and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) but also on the formation of "clusters" in cholesterol-containing
microdomains ( Anatomy and dynamics of a supramolecular membrane protein cluster et al., 2006Anatomy and dynamics of a supramolecular
membrane protein cluster et al., , 2007).SYP5s will act as t-SNARE when present on the membrane of TGN or
late endosomes and PVC, whereas they will behave as i-SNARE when accumulating on tonoplast (Figure 1)Defining new SNARE functions:
SNAREs also interact with several proteins acting as regulators of SNARE-complex formation (Lobingier and Merz, 2012;The binding of
Varp to VAMP7 traps VAMP7 in a closed fusogenically inactive conformation et al., 2012).Defining new SNARE functions: the
Also in Petunia hybrida, the single SYP51 gene cloned up to now (Intracellular Traffic of Proteins and Endomembrane Compartments

A plant characteristic i-SNARE activity could be determinant on vacuoles or post-Golgi endocytic compartments since these compartments appear to
diversify between plants and non-plant organisms ( PostGolgi traffic in plants et al., 2009)Defining new SNARE functions: the i-SNARE
Overexpression of DN variants to inhibit specific functions seems to offer a better tool to affect
the molecular machinery leaving no options to the plant cell to adapt and mask the effect

There were a number of partial precedents for these findings: SITs associated with medial prefrontal cortex

This debate has been most recently summarized by Smallwood (2013a), who has also suggested a resolution among
four main viewpoints: the goal theory of current-concerns (e.g., Meaning and Void Inner Experience and The Incentives

One reason that people mind-wander much more than they are aware of doing may be that mind-wandering and
the metaawareness of doing so engage some of the same brain structures, such as the anterior prefrontal cortex,

The fact that these participants chose some unrewarded trials is consistent with having a need for freer mental activity,

These include a variety of mental processes, including retrieval of past experiences and imagining future scenarios (
The brain s default network et al., 2008), which are essential for planning and are also stock
components of mind-wandering sequences.Raichle (2009) argues that the default-mode network is not coextensive with conscious mind-wandering, citing
the continuation of the network's activity into lighter states of anesthesia and Stages 1 and 2 of
sleep ( Horovitz et al., 2008), when dreaming is most frequent, and the demonstration ( Christoff et

Similarly, reaction times (RTs) in reporting the font color of goal-related words are typically on

and Kane's conceptualization (e.g., Kane and McVay, 2012; Drifting from slow to D oh working memory capacity and mind
wandering predict extreme reaction times and executive control errors, 2012b), on the other hand, features proactive executive control that
keeps people focused on their goal pursuits, from which mind-wandering distractsGoal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams:

It thus appears that although the respondent components of mind-wandering may depend on the default-mode network, they are far
from the only activity supported by that network.When tasks make large demands on processing, the necessary shift of mental
resources from the default-mode network to executive regions is harder to attain with advancing age ( Age differences in

Also, working memory capacity has been reported inversely associated with everyday mind-wandering during resource-demanding activities ( Kane
et al., 2007), positively related to proportionally prospective mind-wandering during an undemanding task ( Baird et al.,

Indeed, it appears that the brain's default-mode network provides the substrate for mind-wandering (e.g., Mason et
al., 2007;Christoff et al., 2009;Stawarczyk et al., 2011b), a network of several "hubs" and "subsystems" (The
brain s default network and its adaptive role in internal mentation, 2012) that probably constitutes a

Mind-wandering is then typically reduced, and activity in the default-mode network is attenuated, a finding that
originally arose out of experimental manipulations leading to the discovery of that network as one whose
activity rises spontaneously and regularly in the absence of work on a task (a "resting state";

This debate has been most recently summarized by Why the global availability of mind wandering necessitates resource

The terms operant versus respondent are taken from Science and Human Behavior's theory (Science and Human
Behavior, 1935) to refer to activity aimed at acquiring reinforcers (or goals) versus reflexive responses to
stimuli, here including one's own mental events.Various investigators have applied varying operational definitions to daydreaming, such
as thought consisting of fanciful content (Freud, 1953), being independent of current task activity (e.g., Singer,
1966), or being unintended and spontaneous, i.e., respondent (Klinger, 1971)Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts
Early on, Correlates of daydreaming a dimension of self awareness and Schonbar (1961) had found that

degree of creativity the students displayed in their account of an "actual daydream" and in a
"spontaneous, original story" that they wroteGoal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams: basic principles
There are large individual differences in the amount of time that people desire to spend in
imaginative daydreaming (Personality and private experience individual variations in consciousness and in attention to subjective phenomena
; Bigelsen and Schupak, 2011), some valuing it as a resource for self-amusement and stimulation and
others eager to reduce or eliminate it but unable to attain a daydream-free state.If moving between
inner-directed and outward-directed states is a kind of automatic decision process, there must be a switching
mechanism that employs some set of criteria for making the switchGoal Commitments and the content of

Again, the point here is that encountering cues related in some way to one's goals takes
higher processing priority over competing cues in a way that helps to explain the gravitation of
undirected thought content to one or another of the individual's goals.On the assumption that males are

The strong evidence for perceptual decoupling raises a further question regarding the processes involved in protecting the

complex to simpler (but still solution-equivalent) problems are reported to be pervasive and crucial in many

reasoning do not apply any full-fledged form of logical or probabilistic (and thus intractable) reasoning
to possibly highly complex problems, but rather rely on mechanisms that reduce the latter to
equivalent, simpler ones (see, e.g., Heuristics The Foundation of Adaptive BehaviorIntuitive and Reflective Responses in

semantic features are specified (Different Selection Principles of Freestanding and Bound Morphemes in Language Production &amp; Caramazza, 2002, 2006Caramazza

For example, closed class words are semantically 'shallow', having fewer semantic features than open class items, which
could make them more vulnerable to damage within the semantic system or between semantics and word form
representations (Allen &amp; Seidenberg, 1999;Goodglass &amp; Menn, 1985;Deep Dyslexia A Case Study of Connectionist Neuropsychology &amp; Shallice,

Patients are poor at matching pictures of objects to their characteristic sounds as well as their names (Non

The fact that patients perseverated more open class items is in line with an account in which weak
activation of target items (due to degraded semantic content) leads to perseveration errors as recently produced items are
both retrievable and more active (Lexical retrieval mechanisms underlying whole word perseveration errors in anomic aphasia, Roach, Brecher

A buyer generally tries to avoid dependence on a particular supplier (Examining customer value perceptions of organizational

Very few dyadic studies on relationship value have considered both sides of particular relationships (Lefaix-Durand &amp; Kozak,

from a value chain perspective (Competitive advantage Creating and sustaining superior performance, 1985), as taken in this
paper, the fundamental difference between a supplier and buyer is that a focal buyer-seller relationship is located
toward the end of a supplier's value chain and toward the outset of a buyer's value chainThe

Since losses loom larger than gains (A perspective on judgment and choice Mapping bounded rationality, 2003), relinquishing
relationship value gains appears less negative than switching cost losses if the relationship is broken off by

Finally, subjective evaluations have their own form of uncontrollable risk for the employee: they are difficult to verify and
enforce contractually, so they require relational contracting and adequate trust of the supervisor (Subjective Performance Measures in Optimal Incentive

So what might be rigorous proof of an attractive candidate? In microbiology, Robert Koch set out three
postulates that had to be satisfied to connect a specific bacterium (among the multitudes encountered, not unlike
current genome analysis) to a disease: the agent had to be isolated from an affected subject, the
agent had to produce disease when transmitted to an animal, and the agent had to be recoverable
from an animal's lesion (Molecular Koch s postulates applied to microbial pathogenicity, 1988)Distilling Pathophysiology from Complex Disease

An alternative approach to solving the reverse inference problem has been developed by Poldrack
and colleagues (e.g., Lenartowicz et al., 2010;Large scale automated synthesis of human functional neuroimaging
data et al., 2011)Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific
To illustrate, consider the motivation given by Word learning as Bayesian inference and Tenenbaum (2007) in developing
their Bayesian account of word learningBeyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation
Over the last 15 years CL theorising within the cognitive sciences has come to be dominated by
approaches in which behaviour is understood in probabilistic terms, with appeal to Bayes' theorem in order to
determine the posterior probability of an event given evidence and prior probabilities (e.g., The Cambridge Handbook of
Computational Psychology, Kemp &amp; Tenenbaum, 2008)Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation
Perhaps just as critically, Anatomy of deductive reasoning (2007) argues that interpretation of the neural data from
reasoning experiments requires a re-evaluation of psychological theories of reasoning, with the neuroscience evidence indicating that human
reasoning involves separate systems for dealing with a) familiar and unfamiliar material, b) conflicting information and belief
bias, and c) certain and uncertain information)Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific
A similar approach to bridging CL and ARL theories also does so by memory retrieval
mechanisms based on relevance to the current context (Anderson, 2007;A functional model of sensemaking in
a neurocognitive architecture et al., 2013;Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive
This approach has recently been adopted by Bayesian theorists in the form of "rational process models"

Sanborn, 2010;Griffiths, Vul &amp; Sanborn, 2012)Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific
For example, over the last decade Human symbol manipulation within an integrated cognitive architecture and
his colleagues have attempted to map the core modules of the ACT-R cognitive architecture onto
brain regions via fMRI data relating to the BOLD response (e.g., Human symbol manipulation within
an integrated cognitive architecture, 2005;Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific
This approach has recently been adopted by Bayesian theorists in the form of "rational process
models" (Rational approximations to rational models Alternative algorithms for category learning, Griffiths &amp; Navarro, 2010;Shi,

One move in this direction is the "computational rationality" approach (Howes, Computational rationality Linking mechanism and behavior
rough bounded utility maximization, &amp; Vera, 2009;Computational rationality Linking mechanism and behavior rough bounded utility maximization, Howes,
&amp; Singh, 2014), which applies Russell and Subramanian's (1995) notion of bounded optimality for artificial intelligence agents
to the analysis of human behaviourBeyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation
Vision A computational investigation into the human representation and processing of visual information (1982) used differential equations,
but other feasible CL languages include formal logics (such as first-order predicate logic, various modal logics, defeasible
logics -see Baggio, van Lambalgen &amp; Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific
One can make many arguments for the utility of developing cognitive models within a cognitive architecture (see, for example,
Unified Theories of Cognition, 1990, andCassimatis et al., 2008), but adopting the concept of cognitive architecture is in fact
highly consistent with Marr's original approach to visionBeyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation
Similar appeals to the utility of CL explanation are common in the Bayesian literature (see, e.g., The Bayesian Reader Explaining
word recognition as an optimal Bayesian decision process, 2006)Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation
Bayesian approaches have been particularly successful in providing putative accounts of behaviour that may be broadly
characterised as inductive, such as categorisation (Tenenbaum &amp; Griffiths, 2001) and reasoning (The probabilistic approach to
human reasoning &amp; Chater, 2001), but it is important to recognise that there are alternative frameworks
within which CL explanations might be developedBeyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive

One can make many arguments for the utility of developing cognitive models within a cognitive architecture
(see, for example, Newell, 1990, andAbility breadth and parsimony in computational models of higher order cognition
et al., 2008), but adopting the concept of cognitive architecture is in fact highly consistent with
Marr's original approach to visionBeyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation
Again, Marr (1982) makes this point, citing Aspects of the Theory of Syntax's distinction between
linguistic competence and linguistic performance within transformational grammar (Aspects of the Theory of Syntax, 1965)
as corresponding to the difference between a CL explanation and an ARL one, with performance
factors modulating the competence theoryBeyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific
Those theories draw on the same distinctions discussed by Goel (see, e.g., On the conflict between logic and
belief in syllogistic reasoning, Barston &amp; Pollard, 1983)Beyond Single-Level Accounts: The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific
Popperian falsifiability is not necessarily a requirement for scientific theorising (Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programs, 1970),
but the implications of the argument concerning performance factors are illustrated by the simulations of Cooper, Yule and Fox
(2003), who compared the behaviour of three classes of model -Bayesian, associationist and hypothesis testing -with that of subjects

But could one not study the operation of the brain directly with neuroscience evidence alone? Notwithstanding Marr's
analysis, some might argue that this approach has been successful in understanding the functioning of peripheral systems
(with low-level visual processing being perhaps the most celebrated success: Receptive fields binocular interaction and functional architecture

Introduction The conceptualisation, operationalisation and assessment of the work-related psychological health of clergy is a matter that seems to
be commanding increasing attention within the fields of pastoral psychology (Charlton, Rolph, The relationship between work related psychological health
and psychological type among clergy serving in the Presbyterian Church USA , Rolph, &amp; Robbins, 2009) and empirical theology
(The relationship between work related psychological health and psychological type among clergy serving in the Presbyterian Church USA ,

In an attempt to bring greater scientific objectivity to the conceptualisation and assessment of clergy work-related psychological health, a
number of studies have employed the The Maslach Burnout Inventory Burnout Inventory (MBI) established by The Maslach Burnout Inventory
and Jackson (1996)Work-Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church (USA): Testing the Idea of Balanced Affect
Challenging Maslach's three dimensional model of burnout, Francis, Kaldor, Robbins, and Castle (2005) argued that a more empirically economic
and theoretically coherent model of clergy work-related psychological health could be developed from The structure of psychological well being(1969)
classic notion of 'balanced affect', according to which positive affect and negative affect are not opposite ends of a
single continuum, but two separate continuaWork-Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church (USA): Testing the Idea
A series of studies has reported findings employing this modified form of the Maslach Burnout Inventory in the United
Kingdom among Roman Catholic priests engaged in parochial ministry (Francis, Louden, &amp; Rutledge, 2004;Francis, Turton, &amp; Louden, 2007) and
among Anglican parochial clergy (Francis &amp; Rutledge, 2000;Francis &amp; Turton, 2004a, 2004bExamining the relationship between burnout and age among

In particular, the negative side concerning the expression and implications of poor work-related psychological health has been reflected in a
series of arresting titles, like Ministry burnout (Sanford, 1982), Clergy stress: The hidden conflicts in ministry (Coate, 1989), Clergy under

By contrast, a slight (albeit non-significant) difference with girls reporting more hallucinations than boys has been
reported (Diagnostic outcome of self reported hallucinations in a community sample of adolescents, Ferdinand, Van der
Ende, Hofstra &amp; Verhulst, 2002)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based study
In general non-clinical populations, women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms (Maric,
Krabbendam, Vollebergh, de Graaf &amp; Van Os, 2003), and specifically auditory hallucinations (Shevlin, Murphy, Dorahy &amp; Adamson,
2007;Distribution of hallucinations in the population, 1991)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based
Childhood trauma has also been shown to increase the risk for having AVH in adult age (Daalman,
Diederen, Derks, van Lutterveld, Kahn &amp; Sommer, 2012;Childhood abuse as a risk factor for psychotic experiences, Krabbendam,
Bak et al., 2004) and may also explain the higher rate of AVH in females as this
is more often reported by females Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based
In young adults (age 18-24), a similar tendency for women reporting higher levels of
hallucinations has been found (Demographic correlates of psychotic like experiences in young Australian adults,
Welham, Martin et al., 2008)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a
However, AVH and voice-hearing may also occur without an accompanying psychotic disorder (Healthy individuals with
auditory verbal hallucinations who are they Psychiatric assessments of a selected sample of 103 subjects,
Daalman, Rietkerk et al., 2010a), and lie on a continuum from psychotic hallucinations to normal

It has been demonstrated that a self-report questions on AVH have a positive predictive value of 71.4% (as well
as a negative predictive value of 90.4%) for interview-verified AVH experiences in adolescent samples (Are screening instruments valid for
psychotic like experiences A validation study of screening questions for psychotic like experiences using in depth clinical interview Harley,

Finally, socioeconomic variables have been suggested as possible modulatory variables on the expression of PLE (Socio

Chant, Andrews &amp; McGrath, 2006)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based study
In clinical samples, rates of auditory hallucinations have been suggested to be higher in female patients (Rector
&amp; Seeman, 1992;Hallucinations in the acute schizophrenic type psychosis Effects of gender and age of illness onset,
Dowd &amp; Janicak, 1999), although there are many confounding variables which may account for apparent gender differences
(e.g., sampling biases, comorbid depression, etc.)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based study
Also, we hypothesized that the prevalence of AVH would be influenced by age, with the lowest prevalence in
the oldest age group.Finally, socioeconomic variables have been suggested as possible modulatory variables on the expression of PLE
(Saha, Psychotic like experiences in the general community The correlates of CIDI psychosis screen items in an Australian

AVH were in most cases transient, whereas the persistence of AVH or transition to psychosis was suggested to
be related to the severity of the hallucinatory experience ( Examining the course of hallucinatory experiences in children
and adolescents a systematic review et al., 2012).Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based
Hormones, in particular estrogens, have been suggested as a factor which modulates the onset and symptomatology of psychotic disorders (Psychopathology

Further, Dissecting auditory verbal hallucinations into two components Audibility Gedankenlautwerden and alienation, Selten, Diederen and Blom (2010b) suggest

Factor analyses of the LSHS have shown that while both of the items used in the present
study load on an underlying "auditory hallucinations" factor (Lari &amp; Van Der Linden, 2005;Prevalence and dimensionality of
hallucination like experiences in young adults, Sisti, Rocchi et al., 2014), the item addressing being troubled by
the voices has also been found to load on a factor associated with psychopathology (Aleman, Nieuwenstein, B
ocker &amp; De Haan, 2001;Waters, Badcock &amp; Maybery, 2003), and has been associated with higher degree of
negative emotionality (Lari &amp; Van Der Linden, 2005Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a
Previous studies from the Bergen Child Study have shown that there is a selection bias where non-responders
have a slightly higher rate of mental health problems, but with low effect sizes and minimal effect
on mean estimates (Predicting nonresponse bias from teacher ratings of mental health problems in primary school children,
Heiervang, Heimann, Lundervold &amp; Gillberg, 2008)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based study
The two AVH items used in the current study have shown strongest loading on the
AVH factor ( Lari et al., 2004;Hallucination like experiences in the nonclinical population, Lari, Cella,
Raballo, Petretto &amp; Preti, 2012)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based
However, the subtypes have also a differential risk for distress and poor functioning, and hallucinations are among the subtypes with
the strongest risk ( Evidence for a persistent environmentdependent and deteriorating subtype of subclinical psychotic experiences A 6 year longitudinal
general population study et al., 2011a;Yung et al., 2009)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based study
In clinical samples, rates of auditory hallucinations have been suggested to be higher in female patients (Auditory hallucinations in

load on an underlying "auditory hallucinations" factor (Lari &amp; Van Der Linden, 2005;Preti, Sisti, Rocchi et al., 2014),
the item addressing being troubled by the voices has also been found to load on a factor associated
with psychopathology (Multi dimensionality of hallucinatory predisposition Factor structure of the Launay Slade Hallucination Scale in a normal
sample, Nieuwenstein, B ocker &amp; De Haan, 2001;Waters, Badcock &amp; Maybery, 2003), and has been associated with higher
degree of negative emotionality (Lari &amp; Van Der Linden, 2005 Note: For parental education, the percentage of "don't

It is not yet clear, however, whether AVHs specifically increase the risk of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, or
whether they represent a non-specific indicator for vulnerability to psychiatric disorders ( Dhossche et al., 2002;Specificity

Also, depressive mood has also been shown to increase the risk of transition to psychosis in individuals
with hallucinatory experiences (Development of depressed mood predicts onset of psychotic disorder in individuals who report hallucinatory

However, the conversion to a psychiatric disorder and need for psychiatric care is probably mediated
by environmental risk factors as well as factors such as coping style, cognitive biases and
negative emotional affect (Auditory verbal hallucinations in persons with and without a need for care,
Kompus, Connell et al., 2014).Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based
Also, the developmental trajectories of language networks in the brain, implicated in the neural basis of AVH (Altered integrity
of perisylvian language pathways in schizophrenia Relationship to auditory hallucinations, Craig, Forkel et al., 2011), differ between adolescent boys
and girls (Hirnstein, Westerhausen, Korsnes &amp; Hugdahl, 2013)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based study
Furthermore, childhood trauma and childhood sexual abuse is more often experienced by females ( Janssen et al., 2004;Molnar
et al., 2001) and is also one of the strongest risk factors for developing clinically impairing AVH and
psychotic symptoms (Daalman et al., 2012;de A comprehensive review of auditory verbal hallucinations lifetime prevalence correlates and mechanisms
in healthy and clinical individuals; Barkus, 2013;Janssen et al., 2004)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from
In contrast to the transient AVH, persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in
longitudinal studies (Persistence and outcome of auditory hallucinations in adolescence A longitudinal general population study of 1800 individuals, Gunther, Drukker
et al., 2011), and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in
younger age groups (Kelleher, Keeley, Corcoran et al., 2012b)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents: Results from a population-based study
Also, the developmental trajectories of language networks in the brain, implicated in the neural basis of AVH
(Catani, Craig, Forkel et al., 2011), differ between adolescent boys and girls (Sex differences in language asymmetry

Findings from research on ultra-high psychosis risk groups have suggested inclusion of additional predictors of psychosis, e.g., negative symptoms, cognitive
and social functioning, in addition to attenuated positive symptoms such as AVH (The psychosis high risk state a comprehensive state

more, these are often conflated in the literature ( Private Equity A Review and Synthesis

This is especially important since the consequences for employees are expected to depend on the
type of private equity takeover in question.Private equity is a term frequently used to refer
to two substantially different types of corporate investment (Private equity and human resource management An

Running parallel to concerns in the policy community, an emerging strand of academic enquiry has begun to examine
the employment consequences of private equity takeovers, largely motivated by the seminal work of Breach of trust in
hostile takeovers, who suggested that acquisitions may provide an opportunity for managers to challenge any implicit contracts between
employees and the firm, thereby expropriating the formerTHE EMPLOYMENT CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATE EQUITY ACQUISITIONS: THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL
Finally, institutional buy outs (IBOs) involve private equity and other institutional investors; here managers do not
hold any shares at all, unless this is part of their reward package ( Why do

an antidote to previous managerial empire buildingTHE EMPLOYMENT CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATE EQUITY ACQUISITIONS: THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL BUY
Indeed, both politicians and trade union representatives have raised serious concerns regarding the potential consequences of
private equity acquisitions for the welfare of employees in acquired firms, calling for stronger regulation and

This would be a conclusive evidence of the presence of impulsive heating mechanisms in coronal loops (e.g.,
On Solving the Coronal Heating Problem, 2006, see Section 4.4)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
To explain both these pieces of evidence, several authors claimed that the loops cannot be at equilibrium
and that they must be filamented and cooling from a hotter state, probably continuously subject to heating
episodes (nanoflares, Hydrodynamic Modeling of Active Region Loops et al., 2002Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
Warm loops are well observed by EUV imagers such as SoHO/EIT, TRACE, and in most channels of SDO/AIA, and

The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point
response function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its
subtraction becomes a very delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;Analysis of a multi wavelength

The evolution of single coronal loops or single loop strands subject to impulsive heating was summarized
in the context of the diagnostics of stellar flares (Diagnostics of stellar flares from X ray
observations from the decay to the rise phase, 2007)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Studies based both on models and on analysis of observations independently suggest that elementary loop components should be
very fine with typical cross-sections of the strands on the order of 10 -100 km ( Beveridge et
al., 2003;Nanoflare Heating of the Corona Revisited and Klimchuk, 2004;Vekstein, 2009)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response
function: it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes
a very delicate issue (e.g., Solar active regions SOHO CDS and TRACE observations of quiescent coronal loops
and Mason, 2003;Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;Terzo and Reale, 2010)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
These equations can be solved numerically and several specific codes have been used extensively to investigate
the physics of coronal loops and of X-ray flares (e.g., Nagai, 1980;Coronal closed structures IV Hydrodynamical
stability and response to heating perturbations et al., 1982;Doschek et al., 1982;Nagai and Emslie, 1984;Fisher et
al., 1985a,a,a;MacNeice, 1986;Gan et al., 1991;Hansteen, 1993;Betta et al., 1997;Antiochos et al., 1999;Ofman and Wang, 2002;Mller
et al., 2003;Bradshaw and Mason, 2003;Sigalotti and Mendoza-Briceo, 2003;Bradshaw and Cargill, 2006)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling
From the comparison with the isothermal structure of hot loops derived from CDS data (Di CDS SoHO multi line
observation of a solar active region Detection of a hot stable loop and of a cool dynamic loop et
al., 2003;Landi and Landini, 2004) and a systematic inspection of the CDS atlas, the conclusion was that there might
be two different classes of loops, multi-thermal and isothermal ( Figure 7).Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
For instance, the different fuzziness measured in spectral lines forming at different coronal temperatures (TriLiving Reviews in Solar Physics
http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4 pathi et al., 2009) has been modeled with loops made of tens of independently pulse-heated strands (Coronal Fuzziness
Modeled with Pulse heated Multi stranded Loop Systems et al., 2010;Reale et al., 2011)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain these redshifts: downward propagating acoustic waves (Hansteen, 1993), downdrafts driven by
radiativelycooling condensations in the solar transition region ( Reale et al., 1996Reale et al., , 1997b), nanoflares (

This has been taken as part of the evidence toward steady coronal heating in active
region cores ( Evidence for Steady Heating Observations of an Active Region Core with Hinode
and TRACE et al., 2010b, see Section 4.4).Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g., Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2007), due
to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be
the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics ( Isothermal Bias of
the Filter Ratio Method for Observations of Multithermal Plasma et al., 2005)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
These loops are invisible in the X-ray band and many of them depart from
sunspots, appear coaxial and are progressively thinner for progressively lower temperature ions (The pressure
and energy balance of the cool corona over sunspotsCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
Also, the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is above 2
MK, which is best observed in X-rays (e.g., Peres et al., 2000;Comparison of Hinode XRT and RHESSI Detection of
Hot Plasma in the Non Flaring Solar Corona et al., 2009a;Warren et al., 2011).Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
Such strands are conceptually different from the thin strands predicted in the nanoflare scenario (Nanoflares and the solar X
ray corona, 1988), which imply a highly dynamic evolution due to pulsed-heatingCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Narrowband filters can show non-unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature (e.g., The Cross Field Thermal Structure
of Coronal Loops from Triple Filter TRACE Observations and Klimchuk, 2007), due to the presence of several important
spectral lines in the bands, but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges
of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics ( Weber et al., 2005)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
Further support to fine structuring comes from the analysis of the auto-correlation functions in SXT and TRACE loop observations
( Observational Appearance of Nanoflares with SXT and TRACE et al., 2008)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain these redshifts: downward propagating acoustic waves (A new interpretation of the
redshift observed in optically thin transition region lines, 1993), downdrafts driven by radiativelycooling condensations in the solar transition
region ( Reale et al., 1996Reale et al., , 1997b), nanoflares ( Teriaca et al., 1999); the scenario
is improving with the better and better definition of the observational frameworkCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
Global "ab initio" approaches have been developed (An Ab Initio Approach to the Solar Coronal Heating Problem
and Nordlund, 2005;Hansteen et al., 2007; see also Yokoyama and Shibata, 2001 for the case of a
flare model) to model -with full MHD -boxes of the solar corona that span the entire solar
atmosphere from the upper convection zone to the lower coronaCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Figure 15 tracks this evolution, which maps on the path drawn in the density-temperature
diagram of Figure 16 (see also Dynamics of flaring loops II Flare evolution in
the density temperature diagram et al., 1992)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Also, the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is
above 2 MK, which is best observed in X-rays (e.g., The Sun as an X Ray Star
II Using the Yohkoh Soft X Ray Telescope derived Solar Emission Measure versus Temperature to Interpret Stellar
X Ray Observations et al., 2000;Reale et al., 2009a;Warren et al., 2011).Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
The emission from hot emission lines (Ca xvii and Fe xviii) has been confirmed from
simultaneous observations with SDO/AIA and with the Hinode/EIS spectrometer ( Testa and Reale, 2012;Spectroscopic Observations
of Fe XVIII in Solar Active Regions et al., 2012)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
Similar results but different conclusions were reached after the analysis of a loop observed with SoHO, invoking a
non-constant cross-section to explain the evidence of isothermal loop ( Models for Solar Magnetic Loops IV On the
Relation between Coronal and Footpoint Plasma in Active Region Loops Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Line-of-sight flows of up to 40 km s -1 were measured along warm and
apparently static active region loops in co-aligned TRACE and the SoHO/SUMER observations (Steady Flows
Detected in Extreme Ultraviolet Loops et al., 2002c)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
Another puzzling issue, certainly linked to the loop isothermal appearance, is that warm loops are often diagnosed
to be overdense with respect to the equilibrium values predicted by loop scaling laws ( Lenz et
al., 1999;Transition Region and Coronal Explorer and Soft X Ray Telescope Active Region Loop Observations Comparisons with
Static Solutions of the Hydrodynamic Equations et al., 2003a, Section 4.1.1)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
Cool plasma flowing in multi-threaded coronal loops were detected in high resolution Hinode SOT observations
with speeds in the range 74 -123 km s -1 (Hinode observations of transverse waves

They were first addressed by Foukal (1976) and later explored more with SoHO observations
( High Velocity Flows in an Active Region Loop System Observed with the Coronal
Diagnostic Spectrometer CDS on SOHO et al., 1997)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined

background ( Priest et al., 2000;The New Solar Corona et al., 2001;Reale, 2002a)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
Hydrodynamic loop modeling showed that Alfvn waves deposit significant momentum in the plasma, and that steady

These warm loops would coexist with hot loops and would show a multithermal emission measure

The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics, such as the passband and the point response function:
it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands, for instance, and its subtraction becomes a very
delicate issue (e.g., Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;Reale and Ciaravella, 2006;Aschwanden et al., 2008;On the importance of background

The analysis of a single loop observed on the solar limb with SoHO/CDS showed a bias
to obtain flat temperature distributions along the loop from ratios of single lines or narrow band
filters (TRACE), while a careful DEM reconstruction at selected points along the same loop was inconsistent
with isothermal plasma, both across and along the loop ( Observational Constraints on Coronal Heating Models

In another study, hot monolithic loops visible with the Yohkoh/SXT were instead resolved as stranded cooler structures with TRACE at
later times (Cooling Active Region Loops Observed with SXT and TRACE ), although the large time delay (1 to 3
hours) is hardly compatible with the cooling time from SXT to TRACE sensitivityCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Density diagnostics through density-sensitive line ratio led to measure directly density values in active
regions (e.g., The Temperature and Density Structure of an Active Region Observed with the
Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode et al., 2007)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
From a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis with a forward-folding technique on SoHO/CDS data, some loops
were found to be isothermal and others to have a broad DEM ( Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer

Also, the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is above 2 MK,
which is best observed in X-rays (e.g., Peres et al., 2000;Reale et al., 2009a;Constraints on the Heating of Hightemperature Active

The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has been addressed by several authors, who apply different subtraction
ranging from simple offset, to emission in nearby pixels or subregions, to values interpolated between the loop sides,
to whole images at times when the loop is no longer (or not yet) visible (Testa et al.,
2002;Del Zanna and Mason, 2003;The Effect of Background Subtraction on the Temperature of EIT Coronal Loops et al.,

Heating by nanoflares has a long history as a possible candidate to explain the heating of the
solar corona, and, in particular, of the coronal loops (e.g., Hydrodynamics and Diagnostics of Coronal Loops Subject
to Dynamic Heating et al., 1993;Cargill, 1993;Kopp and Poletto, 1993;Shimizu, 1995;Judge et al., 1998;Mitra-Kraev and Benz, 2001;Katsukawa

Attempts of systematic studies have been performed in the past on Yohkoh and TRACE data (e.g., Soft X
Ray Loops and Coronal Heating and Klimchuk, 1995;Aschwanden et al., 2000)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Studies of NIXT loops including the comparison with hydrostatic loop models (Section 4.1.1) pointed out that bright spots also
visible in H  band were the footpoints of hot high-pressure loops (Loop models of low coronal structures observed
by the Normal Incidence X Ray Telescope NIXT  et al., 1994)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Studies based both on models and on analysis of observations independently suggest that elementary loop components should be very
fine with typical cross-sections of the strands on the order of 10 -100 km ( Beveridge et al., 2003;Cargill
and Klimchuk, 2004;Probing nanoflares with observed fluctuations of the coronal EUV emission, 2009)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
In particular, whereas the loop total emission measure distribution should steepen above the canonical   1.5 (Jordan,

Observations of active region loops with EIS indicate that isolated coronal loops that are bright in
Fe xii generally have very narrow temperature distributions (3  10 5 K), but are not
properly isothermal and have a volumetric filling factors of approximately 10% ( Observations of Active Region
Loops with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode et al., 2008a).Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
Light curves in the EUV band have been analysed also with a different approach: they have been compared
to simulated ones obtained from sequences of random pulses with powerlaw distribution (Can a Nanoflare Model of Extreme

The slope of the power law is a critical parameter to establish weather such events are able to

Another systematic analysis on another sample of Yohkoh loops in active regions (Scaling Law of
Solar Coronal Loops Obtained with YOHKOH and Tsuneta, 1995) confirmed some of the correlations in
Porter and Klimchuk (1995), but also found a correlation between the loop length and the
temperature, and deviations from RTV scaling laws (Section 4.1.1)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
Models of loops made of thousands of nanoflare-heated strands were developed and applied to derive

This means that, for most of their lives, they can be well described as systems at equilibrium
and has been the starting point for several early theoretical studies (A loop model of active coronal
regions and Monsignori Fossi, 1975;Gabriel, 1976;Jordan, 1976;Vesecky et al., 1979;Jordan, 1980)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
In typical coronal conditions, i.e., ratio of thermal and magnetic pressure    1, temperature
of a few MK, density of 10 8 -10 10 cm 3 , the plasma confined
in coronal loops can be assumed as a compressible fluid moving and transporting energy only along
the magnetic field lines, i.e., along the loop itself (e.g., Rosner et al., 1978;Numerical modeling of
quasi static coronal loops I Uniform energy input et al., 1979)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
(1999) and Determination of the coronal magnetic field by coronal loop oscillations and Ofman (2001), on TRACE
loops, and more recently investigated in a number of studiesCoronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
It has been shown that time-dependent loop models must include a relatively thick, cool, and dense chromosphere and
the transition region for a correct description of the mass transfer driven by transient heating (e.g., The Influence
of Numerical Resolution on Coronal Density in Hydrodynamic Models of Impulsive Heating and Cargill, 2013) and to maintain
the necessary numerical stability (Antiochos, 1979;Hood and Priest, 1980;Peres et al., 1982)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
We expect better resolution switching from narrow-band instruments with few channels ( Weber et al., 2005) to spectrometers (Monte
Carlo Markov chain DEM reconstruction of isothermal plasmas and Klimchuk, 2010;Monte Carlo Markov chain DEM reconstruction of isothermal plasmas
et al., 2012b), but it is difficult to achieve a temperature resolution better than  log   
0.05 ( Monte Carlo Markov chain DEM reconstruction of isothermal plasmas et al., 2012b)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
These equations can be solved numerically and several specific codes have been used extensively to investigate the
physics of coronal loops and of X-ray flares (e.g., Nagai, 1980;Peres et al., 1982;Doschek et al., 1982;Nagai
and Emslie, 1984;Fisher et al., 1985a,a,a;MacNeice, 1986;Gan et al., 1991;Hansteen, 1993;Betta et al., 1997;Antiochos et al., 1999;Ofman

2003;Explosive heating of low density coronal plasma and Cargill, 2006)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma
Along a coronal loop in an active region on the solar limb, while TRACE double filter
ratios led to temperatures between 1.0 and 1.3 MK, the emission measure loci from CDS data
were consistent with a line-of-sight isothermal structure which increases in temperature from  1.20 to 1.75
MK along the loop, in contrast with the nearby multithermal background (Comparison of High Resolution TRACE
Data to Spectroscopic CDS Data for Temperature Determination et al., 2008).Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of
In some of these studies, for instance, seismological techniques are used in order to measure flare-induced loop oscillations
(Ballai et al., 2011) and waves and flows in active region loops ( Three dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling of

The properties of siphon flows have been studied by several authors (Cargill and Priest, 1980;Noci,

One such model addressed the evidence of flat TRACE/EIT filter-ratios along loops that were explained by the multi-filament loop
structure (Multi strand Coronal Loop Model and Filter ratio Analysis and Marsch, 2010)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
Although there is evidence of intermittent heating episodes, it has been questioned whether and to
what extent nanoflares are able to provide enough energy to heat the corona (e.g., Do

It was possible to study the whole evolution of an active region, from the emergence as compact loops filled
with dense plasma to its late spreading, a few solar rotations later, as progressively longer and longer loops filled

These equations can be solved numerically and several specific codes have been used extensively to investigate the physics

There were some early attempts to study the structure along the single strands in
TRACE observations ( Temperature and Density Structure of Hot and Cool Loops Derived from
the Analysis of TRACE Data et al., 2002)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
A similar idea was applied to make predictions about the presence or absence of non-thermal broadening in

On the same line, collections of loop models have been applied to describe entire
active regions ( Hydrostatic Modeling of the Integrated Soft X Ray and Extreme Ultraviolet
Emission in Solar Active Regions and Winebarger, 2006)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of Confined
The upgrade driven by the higher quality of the data has consisted in the introduction of
more detailed mechanisms for the heating input, for the momentum deposition, or others, e.g., the time-dependent
ionization and the saturated thermal conduction ( Bradshaw and Cargill, 2006;Nonequilibrium of Ionization and the Detection
of Hot Plasma in Nanoflare heated Coronal Loops and Orlando, 2008)Coronal Loops: Observations and Modeling of

agricultural year (as determined by the first pronounced precipitation event) and (2) dry spells during the wet season,

Introduction -considering different perspectives on a complex problemScientific evidence of climate warming and of projected resulting impacts can provide
the basis for a responsible and efficient adaptation strategy if implemented in a timely and careful fashion, but can

In this view, the epistemological starting point is a recognition that markets 'do not simply fall out of
thin air' (Kulturelle Geographien der Okonomie Zur Performativatat von Markten pp193 &amp; Boeckler 2007;) but rather are phenomenon

Reviewing recent research on business networks and network change, the paper addresses the existing shortcoming in
the literature with regard to a systematic understanding of change perceptions (Using case methods in the
study of contemporary networks and Trnroos, 2005), and develops the concept of network change as well
as an operationalization for the comparison of actor's perceptionsSensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse
Companies are seen to interact based on their perceptions of the relevant network and their subjective sensemaking of
the logic and exchange mechanisms relating to these activities, resources, and actors ( Ford et al., 2003;Sensemaking and
cognition in business networks Conceptualisation and propositional development et al., 2006)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse
For example, strategic research has looked at strategic groups, either as defined by objective characteristics
( McNamara et al., 2003;Porter, 1985) or delineated by a shared understanding of different companies

Senior personnel changes in organisations; shifts in organisational structures; changes in strategy; as well as acquisitions, mergers

While this research tradition looks at structures of competition between related companies, the channel management or
supply chain literature treats each individual business relationship as a separate entity, arguing that companies have
to respond appropriately to changes in their business environment ( Achrol et al., 1983;Planned and evolutionary
changes in distribution channels, 1974;Stern and Reve, 1980)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network
Further, comparing different actors' ascriptions of the explanatory mechanisms is important because companies adapt to perceived changes
through interactions based on their understanding or anticipation of the changing environment ( Exploring strategy perceptions in
changing environments and Falkenberg, 1989;Reger and Palmer, 1996).Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes

Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value-creating systems (Parolini, 1999) where companies co-operate in order
to develop value for customers and simultaneously compete to appropriate value ( Mller and Svahn, 2006; From value chain
to value constellation Designing interactive strategy and Ramirez, 1993), and marketing alliances where firms cooperate based on formalised and
collaborative agreements ( Das et al., 1998;Gulati et al., 2000).While considerable research exists to explain business network structures in
these different research traditions, the issue of change within networks is less well researched.Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms
This subjective and narrow approach overlaps with An emerging strategy of direct research Administrative
Science Quarterly's (1979) notion of 'strategy as perspective', and provides a representation of actor-network
embeddedness (Halinen and Trnroos, 1998)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
For example, strategic research has looked at strategic groups, either as defined by objective characteristics

Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value-creating systems (The Value Net, 1999) where
companies co-operate in order to develop value for customers and simultaneously compete to appropriate value ( Mller
and Svahn, 2006; Normann and Ramirez, 1993), and marketing alliances where firms cooperate based on formalised and

Osborne et al., 2001;Reger and Palmer, 1996)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
Thus, while events relate to change, the sensemaking of decision-makers drives their behavior as well as the events,
and thereby leads to change (Behaviour and Mind, 1994)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
(2003) and Developing network pictures as a research tool Capturing the output of individuals sense making
in organisational networks (2008) suggest that network pictures, although based on individual managers' sense-making, can be
integrated by researchers to form a broad pictureSensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network
They are therefore posited to guide networking activities, but they are also used to ascribe meaning
to events in the network, such as activities instigated by other actors ( Ford et al.,

First, it has developed an analytical framework illustrating how actors describe mainly been discussed as a theoretical construct and
only a few studies exist using them as a research tool ( Picture this Managed change and resistance in

Business Networks and ChangeRecent research has stressed the importance of network structures in understanding business exchanges (Changes in the theory
of interorganizational relations in marketing paradigm , 1997;Mller and Rajala, 2007)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
While considerable research exists to explain business network structures in these different research traditions, the issue of change within
networks is less well researched.Although there are several approaches to analysing relationships in terms of networks (see Networks in
Socioeconomic Systems A Critical Review for an overview), this article adopts the industrial network approach, underpinned by the interaction
model, to understand different actors' behavior ( Ford et al., 2003;)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network
An Analytical Framework of Network ChangeWhether or not change is perceived similarly by different actors in a
specific network is of key interest, as differences or similarities in any firm's perspective can be used
to understand strategic behaviour (The role of competitive croups in strategy formulation A dynamic integration of two
competing models  and Thomas, 1993;Osborne et al., 2001)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network
Others use concepts such as expansion and contraction (Mattsson, 1987); extension and consolidation (Network structure from from an
exchange perspective, 1982) and splitting and joining (Hertz, 1996)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value-creating systems (Parolini, 1999) where companies co-operate in
order to develop value for customers and simultaneously compete to appropriate value ( Mller and Svahn, 2006; Normann
and Ramirez, 1993), and marketing alliances where firms cooperate based on formalised and collaborative agreements ( Impact of
strategic alliances on firm valuation et al., 1998;Gulati et al., 2000).Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse
As such, network pictures are akin to metaphors: they are rich sense-making devices in their
own right (Metaphors of Memory, 2000)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
Change may be seen as an evolutionary process, where revolution is possible but unusual (Industrial
Networks A review, 1992), similar to a continuous process where stable periods are broken by
radical changes (Halinen et al., 1999)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
Second, case studies are often rich descriptions of events without clear analytical framing; they at best only
partially support quasi-deductive theories, and they suggest some notion of statistical generalization where multiple case studies are
used (Case research as a methodology for industrial networks, 1995)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse
'cognitive strategic groups' (Industry and strategic group dymanics Competetive strategy in the insurance industry 1970 84

knowing what knowledge or inferences may be relevant or irrelevant to a specific issue ( Does trust matter Exploring the
effects of interorganizational and interpersonal trust on performance et al., 1998)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
Therefore, the location of change needs to be analysed, depending on whether it occurs at the
actor, dyad, or network level ( Halinen et al., 1999;Relevance of Focal Nets in Understanding the
Dynamics of Business Relationships et al., 1999)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
Defined in this broad sense, network pictures can, for example, be used to trace the development
of a whole network longitudinally (Making sense of network dynamics through network pictures A longitudinal case
study Industrial Marketing Management and Redwood, 2005)Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes
However, the level of change could also reside in the network itself, affecting the whole business system ( Stability
and change in network relationships and Mattsson, 1987;Havila and Salmi, 2000).Sensemaking in business networks: Introducing dottograms to analyse network
Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value-creating systems (Parolini, 1999) where companies co-operate

These models, however, over-emphasised the forces of 'realisation 'and overlooked the 'profit squeeze' force (also

However, a simple cost exercise showed that if every additional week in employment resulting from supported employment is costed
at a weekly wage of 237, estimated based on the reported mean annual salary of people who were previously
supported by employment and support allowance (ESA) due to illness or disability ( Destinations of Jobseeker s Allowance Income

If one intervention is shown to be both less costly and more effective than its comparator, then
this intervention is dominant and is clearly the cost-effective option; in such cases, no ICER needs to
be estimated.Results of probabilistic analysis are also presented in the form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs), which
demonstrate the probability of supported employment being cost-effective relative to standard care at different levels of willingness
to pay per extra unit of benefit, that is, at different cost-effectiveness thresholds (Representing uncertainty the role

Outside the United States and Canada, however, social exclusion and nonparticipation in ISE has received less research attention.Studies on school
trips to museums and science centers have argued that such trips benefit children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds (Museums schools and
geographies of cultural value, Phillips, &amp; Woodham, 2009) and can affect some children over a year after their visit (Bamberger
&amp; Tal, 2008)Not designed for us - How science museums and science centers socially exclude low income minority ethnic groups
For example, a school system where the knowledge that "counts" is that of the dominant groups can be understood to
disadvantage students from nondominant groups by rendering their knowledges and practices as "other," such that those students eventually decide not

More recently, with the establishment of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG), a local secondorder (or higher-order) accurate Godunov-type
formulation may be intrinsically derived from the conservation laws of the SWE, providing a more sophisticated formulation
than the traditional FV framework ( A conservative high order discontinuous Galerkin method for the shallow water
equations with arbitrary topography and Liang 2011).Topography discretization techniques for Godunov-type shallow water numerical models: a comparative
In this context, applicable Godunov-type water wave models are at most second-order accurate and require a topography discretization
technique and a wetting and drying condition (see Delis and Kampanis 2009 for a comprehensive review).In its simplistic
view, a Godunov-type scheme provides a first-order accurate model that is conceptually based (A Difference scheme for numerical
solution of discontinuous solution of hydrodynamic equations 1959)Topography discretization techniques for Godunov-type shallow water numerical models: a comparative

Third, from the viewpoint of transaction cost theory the choice of governance form is principally a
question of dealing ex ante with ownership rights pertaining to firms and their assets (The Economic
Institutions of Capitalism Firms Markets, 1985); Governance costs in foreign direct investments: A MNC headquarters challenge
Within the empirical setting of this study, these costs occur inexorably out of intra-organizational coordination, but
the same categories are also valid for inter-organizational coordination (An Empirical Investigation of Ex Post Transaction
Costs in Franchized Distribution Channels and Nygaard, 1999).Governance costs in foreign direct investments: A MNC headquarters
Some subsidiaries possess considerable bargaining power either because they have control over key assets such

Hence, governance costs are costs related to the governance of a relationship -be it within
or across organizational boundaries -and according to TCE and internalization theory, the most efficient governance
structure will be the one that minimizes governance costs in the long run (Hennart, 1991;Transaction

The conventional way of dealing with uncertainty and safeguarding problems within TCE logic, is to bring both sides of
a transaction into common governance, typically a firm; which hence explains the vertical and horizontal boundaries of firms (The

In particular, the way RCA has been translated into practice ignores the idea that learning often stems from the

same communication system and Gentilucci, 2006;Gentilucci and Corballis, 2006)Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language
The gestural theory was also boosted by the realization that the signed languages of the deaf are
true languages, with full syntactic and semantic properties, albeit based entirely on visible movements of the hands
and face (Gesture and the Nature of Language et al.Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel
The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by
a number of authors (e.g., Corballis, 2002;From monkeylike action recognition to human language an evolutionary
framework for neurolinguistics, 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008)Wandering tales: evolutionary origins of mental time travel and

The major channel shifts at the Viennese Danube therefore have to be interpreted against the background of the

The GIS-based river and floodplain reconstruction method developed by Spatio temporal habitat dynamics in a changing
Danube River landscape 1812 2006 was first applied to identify historical alterations of the Danube riverscape

In order to conclude whether identified fluvial dynamics reflect the river's typical behaviour rather than an exceptional hydromorphological
state, climatic changes and related flood regimes also have to be considered (Modelling channel evolution and floodplain morphology

Borders of land properties, hunting grounds or administrative borders also proved to be very useful;
