137	We have shown elsewhere   Jensen and Binot    Zadrozny a   b   that natural language programs   such as online grammars and dictionaries   can be used as referential levels for commonsense reasoning   for example   to disambiguate PP attachment	2
138	Thus rather than a single training procedure   we can actually partition the examples by predicate   and train a For a fixed verb   MI is proportional to Keller and Lapata     s conditional probability scores for pseudodisambiguation of   v   n   n    triples : Pr   v   n    Pr   v   n    Pr   n    which was shown to be a better measure of association than cooccurrence frequency f   v   n  	4
