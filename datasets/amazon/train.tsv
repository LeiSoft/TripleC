Caution: Although it is listed as a different version of the same product, the $3.99 Kindle edition is literally a comic book version of this.  The page is misleading, as it lists Moss as the translator and the length as 1120 pages.  When you download the eBook, you get a 71 page comic book. I was able to return for a refund, but this absolutely NOT what the page would lead you to believe.	0
I've read Moss Roberts' other translations for "Journey to the West" and "Outlaws of the Marsh".  I tried a different translation for "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" done by Brewitt-Talyor as well. I prefer the Moss Robert's version because: 1. It comes in a 3 volume set (unlike others) 2. It uses the modern pinyin for names vs. Wade-Giles (e.g. Zhang Fe vs. Chang Fei, Cao Cao instead of Ts'ao Ts'ao) which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class 3. There are maps! I got really lost trying to follow-along with the Brewitt-Taylor version Lastly, Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes, which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the non-fiction history of the 3 Kingdoms period. The 3 classics of Chinese literature are indeed long (about 1000 pages), but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter (where one book is 700 pages), however they are amazing reads. If you could only pick one, then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the 3 for a western reader.  If you are going to read all 3, then start with Journey to the West, then go to Outlaws of the Marsh, then to the Three Kingdoms. FWIW, 3 Kingdoms is packed with adventure, intrigue, tragedy, and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture.  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor. I had a hard time putting these books down, and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well.	1
This is Moss Roberts's translation of the Mao version of the Chinese classic "Three Kingdoms," a highly-influential historical novel that covers a sweep of over a century from 168 A.D. to 280 A.D., encompassing the fall of the Han dynasty, and the ensuing struggle between the resulting three kingdoms, as signaled by the book's opening sentences: "Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus has it ever been." The authorship of the novel is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong, writing in the fourteenth century, over a millennium after the novel's events. Complicating the novel's history, there were at least two main versions of the narrative: a print edition from 1522 (well after Luo Guanzhong's death), and a subsequent major revision of this dating from the 1660s. The version from the 1660s edited by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang (father and son) is the dominant one, and this is the version that Moss Roberts has translated. The novel is episodic, very lengthy, and has a vast cast of roughly a thousand characters, over a hundred of which Moss Roberts classifies as major characters. The original audience would have been very familiar with the story's heroes, who were the subject of popular stories and plays that predate the book. I, however, was entirely unfamiliar with the characters and the historical period, and would have struggled to make sense of it but for Roberts's extensive and very helpful notes. Even with the notes, I found the book an effort to read. While I cannot exactly say that I enjoyed it, I am glad that I read it. The scale of the story is epic: men scheme and betray each other, factions vie for control of the empire, huge armies -- sometimes of over a hundred thousand soldiers -- battle. The book also reminds me of China's long history of civilization. Despite dynastic struggles, such as those shown in Three Kingdoms, China's organized bureaucracy lasted for millennia, run by highly-educated officials (and helped by the invention of paper). The book raises questions of what makes an ideal ruler, an ideal minister, an ideal general, and includes many instances of ruses and clever schemes. The novel's opening chapter includes the swearing of an oath of brotherhood between three heroes, Liu Bei (known as Xuande), Lord Guan, and Zhang Fei in a peach orchard. The scene is renowned, yet I found it underwhelming, as I likewise found other famous moments in the story underwhelming. The lengthy story never once brought me close to tears; I never came to love its heroes. If I had the stamina to re-read the whole book, perhaps this would change. Knowing what lay ahead, having familiarity with the characters, the events might have more emotional weight for me. On my first reading, I was interested rather than moved. And the initial impact of the novel, for me, was bleak: kingdoms fall and rise, cruel and selfish individuals may prosper, heroes are imperfect, everyone dies, women are largely relegated to the sidelines. A handful more assorted comments.... Firstly, I read this in parallel with Brewitt-Taylor's 1925 translation, and I considerably prefer Moss Roberts's version, both for its prose style and for its invaluable footnotes (plus an illuminating one-hundred-page-long afterword). Secondly, as the afterword clarifies, the book drew heavily on historical records, but amended and added to them, so that one scholar, Zhang Xuecheng, later characterized it as "seven parts fact and three parts fiction." Thirdly, this edition includes occasional illustrations, which I welcomed, though their reproduction quality was sometimes poor. Fourthly, the book contains many fantastical elements: portents and sorcery and ghosts. Fifthly, the book contains a fair amount of poetry.	1
If you want to understand Chinese strategy read this. Research has shown we are influenced heavily by the stories of our childhood. The Three Kingdoms is a well known tale in China, not so much in the rest of the world. If you want to understand Chinese strategy, negotiation and leadership - look at the examples that children were taught in this book.	1
It's a challenging read for those of us who didn't grow up with these characters and stories, but if you invest the time and make good use of the excellent Moss Roberts annotations, you can get completely absorbed in it. After working at it for a while, picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again, all of a sudden, I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies. In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of, small print and annotations in even smaller print. I have to use a magnifying glass to read them. Eventually I bought the 2-volume larger format set put out by University of California Press. The print is larger, but still small -- but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself.	1
The books that I got has a few issues. I've only looked through the first book at this moment but I saw that names and words are randomly misspelled throughout the whole book. Also the text is slightly off-centered on the page like it's slanted. It's as if someone had placed it on a scanner in a crooked way. I have screenshots of this attached: notice that the Character "Yuan Shao" is spelled as "Yuan Soao" and that the margin gradually widens throughout on the right hand side. I expected higher quality control that this. This is not acceptable.	0
In AD 235, the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus, Emperor of the Romans, was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states. One included Gaul (modern France), Britain, and Hispania (modern Spain), another Italy and North Africa, and the third was based on Palmyra, ruled by Queen Zenobia. In 270, Aurelian re-united the three kingdoms and re-established the Empire. It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time, the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt (about 190 AD), and it also broke up into the "Three Kingdoms" of the title. Is there any significance to this parallel? The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations, rather astonishing in view of the distances involved. At all events, this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together. For the English-speaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern, unadorned English. To me the names all seem alike, a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters! However, the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain, Cao Cao. He's the kind of man who, hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an ally's house, breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife. Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig! He rides away, meets his host coming in the other direction, and decides he'd better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known. He's the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience. The books (5 volumes in paperback) cover a period of several decades with numerous marches, countermarches, sieges, and battles, including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 800,000 men on 2 fleets of ships and on land. (That's the Battle of Red Hill). While it can be a little tedious because it's so huge, the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature. While there's a map, alas, it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map. The historicity of the story has been questioned, with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction. Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book! It's "just" entertainment, and however good the Archives were, the authors were working a thousand-plus years after the event. It's not history. A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new, People's Republic of China (PRC) official transliteration scheme where Mao Tse-Tung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing. Therefore, any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and people's names are spelled differently. Of course, literature from a foreign culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme, and the PRC one is meant to reproduce more closely the pronunciation used in one of the main dialects of Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin.) Despite these caveats, "Three Kingdoms" is a work worthy of your time.	1
Bought the digital version for a cheap price of $4. Story quality is fine, the technical aspects make it hard to read. It only shows one panel at a time, at low resolution. The Kindle PC app doesn't allow maximizing and justifying so the panels are like 2" in size. I had to manually reduce windows resolution very low as a workaround. Using a surface for vertical aspect ratio doesn't help much either.	1
This is a review for the 4 volume set translated by Moss Roberts, published by Foreign Language Press and sold by Great Wall Bookstore. It has 120 chapters or 2339 pages, the only unabridged version translated by a native English speaker who has been furiously studying Chinese history and language. (I had purchased the ebook version and was disappointed to find those to be incomplete.) I bought them as a gift for my bookworm hubby, since he was hoping to get into some Chinese classics. This book set has helpful footnotes providing enough contexts and also figured and maps. We compared this translation with the more recent one translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Iverson. Together we concluded that Moss Roberts translation is more elegant.	1
I've heard many stories and references to this book growing up it is kind of nice to actually read them for myself.  Unfortunately I cannot read Chinese at all so I had to rely on finding a translated version. I came across and attempted a Brewitt-Taylor translation a while back but could not finish the book through that version.  The names of all the people and the way it read did not quite flow as nicely for me.  This version by Robert Moss is fantastic. It reads nicely and is full of notes and annotations that provide a much deeper understanding of the story, history and of the book itself. The quality of the books are nice, the text is not to fine or big to read.  I am tempted to now shell out the extra 100 bucks for the hardcover editions.  I was only a bit disappointed the shipping of the product which seemed to damage it some. (bent or crushed a bit on edges)	1
The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale, but the quality of this specific collection. You should note that the author, Luo Guanzhong, had a strong bias for Liu Bei's Shu Han, and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment. Pros: - This translation of Luo Guanzhong's masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful. You'll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight. - Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters, locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period. The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong, the period, and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang. Cons: The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves. - There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just weren't edited out. I've never seen so many mistakes in a book before. - The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to, so bath tub readers BEWARE: the pages don't recover from drips, damp fingers, or hot, humid air. That said, as long as you treat them with the care due any book, they'll last just fine. I've read through my volumes three times, and they're still in very good shape.	1
I just want to offer my opinion about this edition (the 4 volume box set printed in 1994 [I believe it is 1994]).  The story itself is a fantastic, engaging read.  The language is fluid and I am finding that it is a lot less dry than I expected and so it is very easy to get through the book. Deciding which edition to purchase was my biggest problem, but so far, I have no issues with this one.  While I read some reviews about spelling errors--and indeed they do exist--they are not at all frequent and detract little from the story.  I also read that the characters names occur in three forms, creating much confusion.  Again, I find this to be untrue.  In fact, the narrative will often clearify who is who for the reader so you are not pondering over names the whole time.  Sometimes a character will be referred to in their style.  I don't know what that means in Chinese (it's probally in the footnotes somewhere), but the style is seperate from the surname and given name.  Most characters styles are never used, except upon introduction, so it's no issue. My advice to the reader who has never encountered the story (I have played the games and done some preliminary research on the era) is to read up a little on the history of the time.  Start with the end of the Han through the Three Kingdoms period and this will at least give you a foundation for what is going on.  It will also familiarize you with some of the names and the important players who ruled at this time. The only thing this edition could use are some good maps.  Being that it is a box set, a few seperate inserts that can be referanced along side the books would be great, but they dont have them, so what can you do. Overall, I am not at all dissapointed and highly recommend the Chinese Classics edition for the serious reader.	1
if you're looking for this, you probably already know what it is. it is fast paced, beautifully written, and an amazing story.  the tapestry of legend and historical fact is well enough woven to give one a sense of what actually happened while having a few over the top events. because there is no english translation of the annals of the three kingdoms, this is as close as an english speaking person is going to get to understanding the period. if the number of characters is overwhelming, the dynasty warriors series of video games actually serves as an abridged version that helps to identify the major players in the ocean of hundreds of characters.	1
First of all, this is a classic of Chinese that is relatively unknown in the west.  This epic could be considered the Shakespeare of the Chinese language.  It depicts the decay and collapse of the Han dynasty.  In the process of this decay, the nation is split into three kingdoms which stuggle for supremacy.  In the process of this struggle, we find tales of friendship, heroism, betrayal, and tragedy.  This novel has thousands of characters, but perhaps the main character is Kongming, the military strategist of one of the kingdoms.  It's a pure pleasure to read his elegantly executed strategies. This translation has a modern feel, so it was easier to read than other translations that I have read.  Robert Moss does a good job of making the story flow.  However, as some other reviewers have said, it doesn't have a poetic feel.  While the story has been translated, it is always difficult to translate literature into other languages.  Having said that, I think this is an excellent translation for those who want an easy read or those who are reading Three Kingdoms for the first time.  Also I strongly recommend an unabridged version, such as this one.  If you read an abridged version, the story won't seem well developed.  The full text is necessary.  I especially recommend this novel for those who are studying politics, military science, or business.  You'll learn lots of strategies for living life.	1
I bought this because I needed something to read while at work, I went through nearly 100 dollars worth of books in one month buying single volumes. A month later, I've not quite finished it still on book 3 (near ending) and being a romanticized historical it is amazing, really brings you into the world and its setting. Got some time? Got some money? Buy yourself this set, honestly an amazing read and will be donated to my local library when I am through with it!	1
THE SET:   This is a good set if you simply want a copy of the book. Paperback, and four easy-to-manage volumes.   This is the Moss Roberts translation. So, you'll get the names and spellings you might be more familiar with - like "Cao Cao" instead of "Tsao Tsao".   It's also a good set if you plan on buying other Chinese Classics like "Outlaws of the Marsh" or "Journey to the West" because they all have uniform editions.   The only possible negatives are since they are somewhat condensing a really long novel into four thinner volumes, the actual pages seem a little thin. I worry from time to time about ripping them.   There are also a number of typos. But in all honesty, I don't really notice them. With the story moving along so quickly and the presence of already-foreign words and names, a typo now and then won't make you stumble in the least. THE BOOK:   "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is a really great (albeit long) story. This is the fictionalized story of a real civil war period in China that occured after the Han dynasty fell. The names, places, and major events were all real. The heroic actions, dialog, and minor events however are mostly imbelished or improvised.   But despite the length and complexity of the story (there are literally hundreds of characters), this book is a GREAT read. Because it has so much content to cover, the book moves at an incredible pace. Characters are literally fighting and/or dying every other page. Although you may get confused by the names, you will not be bored by anything. I often get bored by books, but everytime I pick this one up I am sucked in instantly.   And if you have played any of the Dynasty Warriors or Romance of the Three Kingdoms video games, you should most definitely read the original tale. Plus, you may have a head start on the complexity from knowing some of the characters/events already.   If you're at all interested in ancient warfare, drama, or literature, you need to read this book.	1
First off... I won't waste your time in writing a review on the Three Kingdoms - I'm assuming that if you're reading this review, you're already aware of just how important/incredible/enjoyable this novel is.  Truly a great entertaining story and yet so many lessons can be learned from it.  It's no wonder why this is so widely taught in most Asian school systems. I will, however, comment on this specific 4-volume package.  This is arguably the best packaged-set available (at this time) for those that want to read the novel.  It's not a "collector's edition" - there's no leather binding or any other high-end detail associated with it, but rather it is a simple and convenient set. Unlike other versions being sold, it is somewhat smaller (I believe the dimensions are already displayed in the item details) - so it is very convenient to carry around (e.g. read on the subway, train, plane, etc).  It's broken up into 4 volumes (page numbers are continuous - so volume II starts on p597) and the overall quality is actually pretty good.  It's your typical paperback book. Prior to purchasing, I read a number of reviews complaining of how "thin the paper was" and that it made it "completely unreadable."  I did not find this to be an issue.  Yes, the paper is probably thinner than one would expect... but nothing where it poses a threat of being damaged easily or anything of the sort.  I also didn't find any issues with being able to see the lettering on the subsequent page (as its shadow is visible on the page you're reading).  Yes, it's there and yes, it's noticeable (especially when there a poem - as the poems are indented); but again, I didn't find it to be an issue. I debated back and forth on what "version" I wanted to purchase and I can honestly say that I'm quite pleased with this purchase.  It's good quality, it's packaged nicely in a boxed 4-volume set (each volume has notes at the end - so no need to search for notes in another book; as is the case with other versions), it's the unabridged version (a MUST - please avoid any abridged version - as they often leave out so much), and it's affordable (complete set costs as much as one volume of other sets).  It's also a Moss Roberts translation - something I would recommend.  And it also uses the pinyin Chinese translations (more easily pronounceable - in my opinion).  Nice introduction, good notes throughout, etc... so also a great option for those "studying" the novel. Simply put, if you're looking for a collector's edition that you're going to hand down from generation to generation with leather binding, hand-drawn images, color, etc, etc... obviously this is not the set for you.  But if you're looking for an affordable, compact, convenient, and accurate translation... then this is the one for you.	1
Now that I finally finished the book, I will say a few words about this book.  It's a long story and it took me over 3 months to finished it.  I did enjoy this historical novel which is said to be 70% based on history and 30% fiction. The characters in the book are more alive in the reader's imagination than in the book itself because there isn't much character developement.  The book doesn't flow or read smoothly instead it feels almost mechanical.  But the events and the actions take a life of it's own in the reader's imagination.  I don't know the Chinese language but maybe there were some essence that was lost in the translation. The events and the strategy that were used in that era of history were brilliant.  Even though this happened hundreds of years ago, I have to remind myself these people were not simple, ignorant farmers.  Instead they were manipulative, calculating and deceptive as much as, if not more than the politicians that we have now. Of all the events in the book, what I still remember is how people are killed so easily and at a whim of those in authority.  No wonder so many people were in fear of their lives and what they said and did because they were at the mercy of the authority.  Another thing I marvelled at was the scale of the wars and battles they had where hundreds of thousands of people would fight and die just because their king wanted ot attack their neighbor. All said, I would reccommend this book for those who have some interest in China or that era of Chinese history.  I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because of the lack of the character developement which would have made this historical novel much more enjoyable and readable.	1
Anyone that has played the games or Dynasty Warriors should really read the books. They can be a hard read at times with the names but it is well worth it, i have read them more then once and still i love them. There are SO many stories that the games never touch on that will just amaze you even farther about the beloved characters in the games.	1
The tactics of The Art of War is pretty much used throughout the book by many of the warlords. The multiple layers of military deception and feints gets so deep that it creates the oddest strategy of all: Predicting that your enemy will anticipate a trap or deception, and go the obvious route instead. Basically to sum it up. 1) China splits up into a dozen warring states and warlords. 2) The "Mandate of Heaven" seems to motivate the warlords to continue fighting, thinking it's heaven's wish to eventually reunite China (which probably keeps China from becoming like Europe, with a dozen states coexisting). 3) The Art of War is known by nearly all the warlords, all the battles are very tactical. 4) If you're interested in Game theory, there are many complicated alliances, breaking of alliances and betrayals between warlords.	1
If you have ever played any of KOEI Dynasty Series games, then you are familiar with the Han Dynasty and some of the Chinese History. If you were interested in knowing more than what you did in the video games, then this book is for you. This is an awesome epic novel, sweeping the history of Chinese history. All of the characters that are in the Dynasty Series game are here for our further knowledge. Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Lu Bu, Cao Cao, Cao Song, Dio Chan, Sun Ce, Sun Quan, Sun Shiang San..... the list goes on and on. This story written over a thousand years ago, accurately portrays the lives and feelings of these "heroes". The author is a little swayed by the Shu family, and he seems to favor them, portraying Guan Yu, Liu Bei and Zhang Fei as the most loyal and honorable sworn brothers, with Cao Cao a sort of evil madman. But that is okay, since I never liked Cao Cao in the game anyway. All in all, this is a long and worthwhile read. I would recommend the unabridged version as it is more complete and thorough. You will not be disapointed to see these wonderful characters come to life.	1
This is an awesome set. Complaints about how thin the paper is I find to be unreasonable. The paper is completely adequate - now the New American Bible - that's thin paper. The typos are slightly annoying but not too much of a big deal. The translation I find to be very readable. The material is dense and the footnotes are vital. The amount of information on even a single page is astounding and does not lend itself to a quick or passive read. Anyone who has read more difficult historical works such as Thucydides or Caesar shouldn't have any problem with the style.   Like most I became aware of this story through video games, specifically the Dynasty Warriors games. The games were a good primer for the actual text, as the reader already has mental images of the characters and battles - while the mental images of the characters conjured by the games may not be historical, or accurate, they lend themselves to remembering and differentiating individuals - which can be difficult for western readers because of the Chinese names which naturally seem foreign and hard to remember to westerners. I have always had an easier time with Japanese personal names over Chinese personal names, When you start throwing in X's and Z's in the translated names, my brain just goes "What? Strange and unfamiliar!" Therefore the primer videogame course helped me immensely.   I do wish the box that holds all 4 volumes was a little more robust, but for the price of the set, I cant really complain. Overall very pleased. Now I need a statue of Lord Guan to start offering incense to the "God of War."	1
The writing style is interesting, though it is fairly obvious the tale was meant to make Cao Cao out to be the villain and Liu Bei to be the ultimate in compassion and goodness.  Despite that, the stories are colorful and intriguing, though it can be difficult at times to keep track of the names of all the provinces, warlords, underlings, etc..  Rereading helps to alleviate any confusion.	1
Whether you've been there or not, "Three Kingdoms" will provide you deep insite into Chinese History and Culture.  Encapsulated in a Swashbuckler worthy of Hollywood, it is a roadmap to over 2000 years of a culture the West generally knows so little about.  Much as the tales of King Arthur, portray Romanized Britain during the disintegration of Rome, Knightly Brothers strive to preserve the Han Empire or carve kingdoms amidst battles, plots, counter plots, seduction, and betrayal.  These are stories that, even in English translation, show us as much about Chinese thought, in the way place, time, and events are portrayed, as can be gleaned from actual dialog.  Annotated, Three Kingdoms can read on many levels from light entertainment to historic cultural education.	1
This page is completely messed up: the three editions are entirely different, The kindle edition is an English language comic, the paperback appears to be an English translation of the Chinese novel, and the hardcover is the original Chinese novel!	0
It is a great book but the font is really small and they printed it wrong so the lines don't align too well.  If you want your eyes a little less stressed this isn't the book to get.  but plot is great!	1
Regarding the four Classics of Chinese literature, there is a popular saying that goes: "lao bu kan san guo, shao bu kan shui hu", translated as: "The young shouldn't read Water Margin while the old shouldn't read The Three Kingdoms". I did just the reverse: as a teenager living in France I voraciously read Water Margins, that depicts the lives of 108 outlaws (I knew all of their names by heart!) and is supposed to have a negative influence on young boys because of its vivid display of violence and its apology for the overturn of the social order that made it a favorite of Chairman Mao. The Three Kingdoms was not available in French at that time. I discovered this second classic much later in a Japanese translation, at an age when readers allegedly shouldn't be exposed to its depiction of stratagum, deceptions, frauds and trickeries that cunning politicians could use to their advantage. My dream is that when I reach old age and become conversant enough in Chinese, I will be able to read The Three Kingdoms and Water Margins, as well as the other two classics of Chinese literature, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber, in their original versions.	1
The historic novel of the three kingdoms was a fantastic read. The literary style was, at first, difficult to get used to but the story itself is told in a very straightforward fashion and the characters are very rich. The constant turn of events will have you rooting for the splendid victories throughout Shu-Han's campaigns and lamenting their bitter losses. I noticed many typos throughout the entire novel but they're few and they're small enough to avoid confusion as you read. Overall I think this particular translation was excellent. It was recommended to me and I would gladly recommend it to anyone who has an affinity for this great age of chivalrous heroes and tyrannous villains.	1
A most loved collection for our kids growing up. Must have for the history buffs and strategy lovers.	1
Best translation ive read. This would be the third iteration of this story ive read. The names are spelled correctly with grammar and general spelling mistakes being far less in this rendition. The books physical quality isnt anything to ride home about. Pages wrinkle and warp easily with some text being blurry (only a few pages). Came with a few pages already wrinkled too. Still highly recommended for someone seeking the best translation. This one even has a few pictures and maps. Get this one for reading and then find some special hardcover run for the shelf if you really like it.	1
Translation is good (well I wouldn't know about accuracy, but I didn't find it hard to read). As for the story itself, keep in mind that this is a book of tremendous historical and cultural importance (at least in China). If you're reading it because of that, then you're going to get what you want out of it. However taken on its own in comparison to modern works, the story itself is sort of meh, at least in my opinion.	1
This book is EPIC.  This has to be one of the greatest stories ever told.  I would recommend this to anyone.  There are typographical and spelling errors every now and then, but I mean come-on, this is a 1000+ page book published by a chinese company, it's very good that there are so few typos.  Someone remarked that this was not a good version and advised to "check your local library."  He must not know that this is considered the definitive edition of the book, and one of the best unabridged versions out there.	1
After falling in love with the movie “Red Cliff” I discovered that its’ narrative was based on this classic chinese novel. And since this story is so ingrained in the East so as to be part of the culture itself I was determined to ferret out a copy and see for myself. This is a huge book, it spans generations and took me months to read. My edition was smartly broken up into four books, so I didn’t have to carry around a huge dictionary sized brick, I appreciate that. What I didn’t appreciate was at the end of book four is a list of important characters, their descriptions and even a list of titles with definitions. How is that offensive? Well I sure could have used that while reading books one through three! Being a westerner, I’m just not that comfortable with all of these chinese names and words, some of the characters only differ by ONE letter! Not to mention most of the main characters have more than one name, used interchangeably. There are also a ton of characters, many who will never appear again, for me, someone who is not good at names, this was a bit of a trial. However, I’m glad I read this, I’m glad I own a copy, and I look forward to reading it again one day. The story itself is impressive with ample amounts of action, tactics, political intrigue, humor, and even romance. I can see why this story has endured for so long. This was not an easy, casual read for me, but it definitely deserves it’s rank as one of the four great Chinese classics.	1
I want to post this to help R. Pham and other readers in your research re: " Three kingdoms" . I'm originally from Viet Nam  and had read this story in Vietnamese when I was in Viet Nam (translation word by word , from Chinese, full version , Vietnamese translator : Tu Vi Lang) For the English translation , I have a "full " (i.e. unabridged) version : (bought in US , not through Amazon.com , I bought this at a Chinese English Bookstore in Boston, Massachusetts, USA) : "Three Kingdoms," Library of Chinese and English Classics, Attributed to Luo Guanzhong , Translated by Moss Roberts, Foreign Language Press (China) .

I purchased this a few years ago and, when I came across the product again, remembered this as being one of the best books I've ever read. If anybody is interested in reading the Three Kingdoms, this version is THE translation to get. (And the notes in the back are very useful, too). So worth reading over and over again.	1
Good	1
The books themselves were in good condition. No pages missing, no tears or anything like that. BUT, the product, all 4 bucks smelled HORRIBLY. So bad that it gave me a headache while reading. Books are literally unreadable. Have tried many things to get rid of the smell and nothing works.	0
I'll be perfectly honest: I've never been one to actually sit down and read a book unless it's been marked required reading. In fact, my only fantastic literary claim up to this point was conquering the Harry Potter series. Then, I picked up these volumes. I was absolutely enthralled. I picked up this book because I'm a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series. In fact, I just recently discovered that the games themselves were based entirely off of this collection. From then on, I had a blast both playing through the games and reading the books, trying to pick out scenarios and information the game had changed (or in some instances, just completely left out). In the process, I learned something new about ancient Chinese culture and managed to have a fantastic time doing so. I highly recommend this book. And as many others have said, do NOT buy the abridged version. Spend a little extra and get the four volume set. You'll get a lot more out of the reading.	1
Nice books.  I am reading along as I watch Chinese TV series on Three Kingdoms.  An exciting way to learn about history and Chinese culture.	1
There are some translation errors here and there (for instance, someone would be put to "deach" rather than death), but other than that it's exactly what you paid for. Better value and translation than the other books that are listed, and you're getting the whole set of books instead of just one or two. I hate that I sound like I'm trying to sell the book, but really this is the best version you can buy unless you learn Chinese and translate it yourself.	1
Great book but poor editing. The translations and annotations are good. The terrible editing and textual errors make it a hard read.	1
For Americans. Is it the correct translation? No, but that is okay, because a lot of people who buy this book will have done so from exposure to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games from Koei, and they used the Americanized spelling that unfortunately doesn't match up pronunciation wise, but the names are the same as they appear in all the games. I much prefer this, as I bought a copy of the original translation, and had no idea who the hell they were writing about. For those of us who got exposed to this, one of the greatest stories (about 70% true) ever told, having to go back and relearn all the names would be VERY taxing, not to mention annoying as hell.	1
Ordered my complete edition of Three Kingdoms from this seller. Was very impressed. I got brand new books in a very short time frame, and for a great price.	1
Initially when the books arrived, I received a misprint where volume 1 was just volume 3 with the volume 1 binding. Luckily the seller was right on top of it & sent me a new copy of volume 1 with no issues & no headaches. It arrived promptly & in one piece. The only reason I'm giving the series 3 stars instead of 5 is due to the heavy ghosting with the text in the books. All four volumes seem to suffer from ghosted text & it can get really distracting. The text from one side of a page bleeds through very noticeably to the other side which gives me a little bit of a headache when I read for an extended period of time.	1
An exciting if convoluted novel depicting an epic period of chaos in Ancient China. This novel is wonderfully translated, and I can't imagine that was an easy job. Also includes helpful footnotes, illustrations, etc.	1
I have read and enjoyed Three Kingdoms for over 10 years.  I recently re-ordered this version because my last edition was getting worn.  This Moss Roberts translation is the best English translation of Three Kingdoms on the market, and the introduction, afterword and footnotes contain a lot of additional, interesting historical information for anyone who enjoys the period.  This is the only edition of Three Kingdoms I would purchase or recommend for an English speaking audience.	1
My favorite work of Chinese literature, rendered in very good Enlgish.	1
to become familiar with a Chines literature classic.	1
The Chinese Iliad that exults the strategist over mere warriors	1
Great quality! Great price! Highly recommended for anyone learning Mandarin or wanting some classic Chinese literature.	1
not finish reading yet!	1
Love this book. Read it when I was in university and now bought to own and read it again. Can't put the book down.	1
The book shipped quickly and was in good condition. It comes in 4 volumes in a box. The page length is very long, and the paper is the same type of paper than you'll find in many bibles: thin, but good. This story is one that should be read and appreciated more widely.	1
I first became intrigued with the Three Kingdoms's historical events when I played the game Dynasty Warriors 2 for PS2. Afterwards I was desperately searching to find the best novel translation and finally bought the 4-volume box set translated by Moss Roberts which is the UNABRIDGED version(make sure to get this edition as it tells the whole story w/o leaving anything out).I then set out to explore the 2200+ pages of Chinese history and I must say, it was a fascinating experience. I initially grasped what was going to happen in time but there was so much other details to the story and idealisms portrayed. Leadership, loyalty, heroism, military tactics and warfare, treason, and even romance play such a significant role in this epic novel. "The empire long united, must divide" and "the empire long divided, must unite" pretty much opens and closes the novel perfectly. Heroes such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, and Huang Gai portray such loyalty that it would be kind of hard to imagine in today's society. From the other reviews I've read, most people think Liu Bei (Xuande) is the protaganist of the novel and this seems very true since Roberts lauds Bei's characteristics and portrays Cao Cao of the evil and cunning type. Personally, I think anyone can choose their personal protaganist and for me that would be Zhao Yun because of his undisputed bravery and loyalty. Another character that I admired was probably Zhuge Liang for his awe-aspiring military tactics. Zhuge was the best strategist of his time and he wrote several books on warfare but unfortunately, most were destroyed but you can still buy one of his famous books, "The Art of War." Warning, spoiler ahead:   This book has its sad moments particularly when someone important or someone who contributed a lot to his lord dies. You'll feel sympathetic towards those who fought hard as well as the ones who died. When the book starts, it's during the impending collapse of the Han then around 220 is when the real three kingdoms come into play: Shu, Wu, and Wei. It's sort of like a battle to the death of who would emerge victorious and indeed there was. Military tactics are exploited on each side and betrayal is widespread. In the end, it would be Sima Yi's family who would unite China under one rule, the Jin Dyansty.	1
I have heard that to truly understand Chinese culture, one must read The Three Kingdoms.  That may be, but this epic is a masterpiece of literature in any language.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the classics of world literature.	1
Really wanted this as I only had Volumes I and II.  Much more accessible than earlier Brewitt-Taylor translation.  If you liked Red Cliffs (short or 2 dvd international version) - you'd enjoy this.	1
The books arrived promptly and in excellent condition! I was pleasantly surprised to find the character drawings, ancient maps that described the provinces at the time and the people who ruled over them, and a very in depth reference in the back of the book that went into detail about several of the incidents mentioned in the story and how they relate to historical records. Of course, the story itself is an entertaining read. Highly recommended.	1
Very good translation of the original novel.	1
Awesome blend of history and story.  Difficult to tell where history leaves off and story begins.	1
If you're into classical Chinese literature, this is a must read. Once I started, could hardly put it down.	1
My son loved this book. He plays Koei's Dynasty Warriors series and he fell in love with this book. I read a little bit of it and I am rather fond of it too. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good action book about unification of the land. This book has not left out a single detail about the story.	1
The writing doesn't flow very well but the story is very enjoyable.	1
It's like I never stop turning the page when I read this.  Truly amazing, adventurous, and full of perspective of many different characters.	1
Three stars because it's three kingdoms. I couldn't get through the book. If the Odyssey just wasn't long enough, this one is for you.	1
It is interesting to see what was going on in the ancient world's other great empire at the same time that Rome was entering it's century of chaos.	1
A timeless classic...	1
Been looking for these books since ever, and I love them. Thank you!	1
Having played a number of games in the Dynasty Warriors series, I wanted to get acquainted with the original story. I'd originally found a free copy hosted online, but that copy was of an early 20th century translation and the antiquated language was often difficult to parse. The Moss Roberts translation has been considerably easier to read (frequent spelling errors notwithstanding), and I enjoy the illustrations and map diagrams that show up here and there. I've nearly finished the second volume, reading a chapter or two a day, and look forward to several more weeks of adventure.	1
Ok, Three Kingdoms is a amazing volume which mixes history with mythlogy during the three kingdom period of china's past. It really is a great story! The only bad part is that this volume seems like a rough draft. There are literally tons of spelling errors and mis-use of english language. Obviously they should have put more effort into translating this better for the english audience. And the price of $39.99 is a bit hefty for 4 paper-back books! I would look for a different translation for a cheaper buy.	1
The story is very extensive, though having some grammar and spelling errors the four volumes story is an excellent read.	1
Outstanding.	1
Very entertaining	1
A timeless piece of literature. Capture the history of the Han Dynasty in a most intriguing tale where ideals and ambitions collide.	1
Good books	1
Three Kingdoms is one of the most important works of Chinese literature. The story itself is there, but the ridiculous number of grammatical and spelling errors throughout the 4-volume set can spoil the experience just a bit.	1
If you are alive and know how to read you should read this book, no one in the world would give it less than 3 stars.  It is a very long book but it will be very much worth it to read anyway, and when you're done, you can brag to your friends that you've read a 2000+ page book.  It will go by much faster than you would think.	1
Set was Christmas gift for my nephew; he really liked the book set and will buy the Chinese version later.	1
Very easy to understand	1
My best friend from America had wishes for this series, so of course I was going to give it to her for Christmas. The package arrived earlier than I had expected. Nothing to complain about, she LOVED the books! Thank you very much :)	1
Very good, fast shipping.	1
Everything is perfect thank you	1
Amazing story, could not put the books down.	1
Romance of the three kingdoms , what else can I say.	1
I originally bought it because I played the Dynasty Warriors games.  Now that I finished it, I can easily say its one of my favorite stories.	1
Three Kingdoms is a action packed novel that deserves to be called a classic.  Nevertheless all the Chinese names and the repetitive battle scenes could easly lose the novice reader after the first thousand pages or so.  If you buy this be prepared to read the footnotes throughly and become a student of Chinese culture.	1
I much enjoyed this translation. Although the names are a little different, it flowed quite well and its for a fourth of the cost!	1
Got all my books and they were in good condition. Nuff said	1
epic	1
This history has a superb drama and excelent descriptions of the battles of old China. Recommended for those whom like a good plot, heroic battles and everything else words can describe.	1
This novel is absolutely fabulous! I recommend the tv serie which is really close to this novel: Romance of the three kingdoms 2010: [...]	1
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is possibly the most famous and important novel in classic Chinese literature.  Not only is it the earliest of the "Four Great Books" (as evidenced by its more archaic language), but it created a complete cultural phenomenon whose impact is still fresh today -- just ask all the young people today who, without having read a word of the book, still know the characters from the strategy and fighting video games released by the company Koei.  And how many literary works can claim to have had a direct impact on history as this book, which was used as a strategy text by the great Manchurian leader Nurhachi and his son Hongtaiji? I'd read the original archaic text when I was about eight years old, so obviously my views will be heavily slanted by my familiarity with this text.  On approaching this translation, what I find is a well done, respectful and informative translation that doesn't quite nail the tone of the original text, but will be a good read for modern readers who don't read Chinese. And to be honest, Chinese is extremely hard to translate into English.  Just the fact that subjects, articles and pronouns are often omitted from a sentence is enough to cause nightmares for a Chinese-English translator.  And even by Chinese standards, The Three Kingdoms is a work whose linguistic economy is staggering.  In one page, this book can convey the deaths of half a dozen characters, three to four battles, multiple schemes, and include four or five "tribute" poems, to boot.  Such is the style of this work, and it could not have been easy for translator Moss Roberts to adapt this style into English.  And he has done the job remarkably, for though I don't think he was able to convey the flavour and rhythm of the original language (the question is, also, whether that would have been possible), his translation makes a good read, and strives to be faithful to the original text, down to the chapter divisions and the inclusion of the "tribute" poems which frequent the book.  This was an essential piece in the style of the book and I was joyed to see the device retained. There are instances scattered throughout where I felt the tone of the language may have been misinterpreted, or diluted by the language barrier.  Obviously, I'm not a Chinese professor (as Prof. Roberts is), but as a native speaker, I felt his translations sometimes didn't quite hit the mark.  For example, in the original text, one poem on the character Cao Cao distinctly used a word which meant "deception" or "guile", but Prof. Roberts adapted it to "craft", which dilutes the disapproving tone of the original.  When Yuan Shao refused aid to Liu Bei on account of his son's illness, his advice to the messenger was "if he is in trouble, he may seek refuge with me", which suggests patronage, not "find refuge north of the river", which suggests a tactical manoeuvre related to geography.  These are but two examples and you can certainly argue that the meaning of the original text is up for grabs, but as a Chinese native speaker and reader, one who has grown up with this text and re-read the book hundreds of times, I still find the translation a little off.  There is also no attempt at creating period flavour in the language -- the translation is modern, not aiming to add archaic English flavour to try to reflect the age of the original Chinese text.  This may be a good point, however, since the use of archaic English added to the language barrier might have resulted in a book that's very difficult to read.  I think Prof. Roberts sacrificed flavour for clarity, a fair tradeoff to the benefit of the translation. Again, the question is whether an English translation (or any other translation) could ever be accurate in this way to the original.  Personally, I do think many of the discrepancies in meaning could have been avoided, or ameliorated.  However, as aforementioned, for a reader who's never read the original, this issue won't affect his/her enjoyment of the text.  Just the fact that there is a translation of this extremely important work of Chinese literature is a cause for celebration, and for those people new to this realm, this set of books is a great discovery.	1
The package arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.  It was a gift for my son.  He's enthralled by the story.  "Moss" is an excellent translator.	1
Very good quality compare to the price, and mine got shipped after 2-3 weeks of order.	1
Great quality, don't understand a lot of the complaints. Pages are fine, notes are there, writing and research are great. Only complaint is that comers of the books came are bent and damaged.	1
Way too many names for a single character, and there is a ton of characters in the story.	1
Purchased as a gift for my son. He is very pleased!	1
Xmas present was loved!	1
the actual books were fantastic; Moss Roberts' translation is simply wonderful! however, the packaging was damaged so completely that the books were warped almost to the point of disfigurement... quite a shame considering how wonderful the actual text is.	1
My husband loved it!	1
I had various language collection of these books. Excellent story and well translated! My wish is that the foot note can be put at the end of each page instead at the end of the book.	1
typos all around	0
ok why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good.  strange.	1
images, no zoom	0
Exactly what expected and really happy for the purchase!	1
The font size of words in this book is too small, that will hurt your eyes. I am wondering why the press publish a book like this, to save papers. that is so stupid!	0
Great books in perfect conditions. I recommend everyone to read this series.	1
Great book!	1
Received item as advertised although shipping took longer than normal.	1
Best version I've found thus far.  4 volumes of musuo madness.	1
Son was thrilled with this gift, exactly what he wanted	1
This is the most difficult to read book I have ever read. I mean this literally. I am not talking about the reading level or the quality of the translation. The pages are the thinnest I have ever seen in a book. You can clearly see the text from the other pages quite clearly. The low contrast makes the page literally difficult to read. I know they did this to cut costs, but this is stupid if you can't even read the book. I would have rather paid an extra 10 to 20 dollars for some thicker pages and an extra volume. Try and find a better version if you can.	0
This is what I was promised: Condition: New BRAND NEW,GOOD QUALITY AND FAST DELIVERY. ALL HAVE FREE TRACKING NUMBER WITH REGISTERED. What I really get is a broken case, and two of the volumes are not in a good condition. Still the inside is good and the product is what I asked for. So the books are apparently not new, or the delivery is of a very bad quality. Also I had some problems with the delivery at first, but the communication with the seller is really good, and he solved the problems quick and efficiently. I would recommend this seller and the product, but I would care to ask for a good condition of the product before i ask for it...	1
the item is listed as a "Box Set in good condition" but i did not get the box to hold them in and the condition was 6/10 so it was less then what i expected but i know the books themselves are a good read	1
This is a great CD full of Rampal's great masterpiece. Although the flute legend has passed away for over ten years, his legacy lives on. His interpretation of these pieces are splendid and one can truly appreciate his work. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the flute, especially those who want a different interpretation in music from someone other than James Galway.	1
The delivery was pretty speedy. Little damage to the side of the book I would have preferred it to be shipped in a box instead of a bag but got here fine with minimum damage.	1
The long-lived Han dynasty is finally succumbing to effects of a weak Emperor and corrupt government that is cause injustice throughout China resulting peasant revolts while nobles strive to reform the court.  Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong, probably, dramatizes the 112-year history of the end of the Han dynasty as the empire divided into the titular three kingdoms before being reunified under the Jin while being true to history for nearly the entire text. The weakness of the Emperor Ling and his corrupt court results in the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Emperor asks all loyal subjects to come to arms to fight the rebels.  Among that answering the call is Liu Bei, a scion of the Imperial clan, who befriends and joins in a sworn brotherhood Lord Guan and Zhang Fei, Cao Cao a member of a long servicing Han bureaucratic family, and Sun Jian an accomplished general.  The numerous warlords crush the rebellion but remain in charge of various districts when the Emperor dies thus setting the stage for the warlords vying for power by controlling the child Emperor and then his young brother when Ling’s immediate successor is deposed (then murdered).  Sun Jian heads to the Southlands and founds a dynasty that is cemented by his son Ce that eventually becomes the Kingdom of Wu.  Cao Cao’s Machiavellian political acumen and military success results in him getting control of the last Han Emperor, Xian, and control of the northern heartland that eventually becomes the Kingdom of Cao-Wei.  Liu Bei and his sworn brothers bouncing from district and district trying to restore the independence and good governance of the Han but the warlords that they serve under continue to fight for their own power.  Then the brotherhood is joined by a military-political advisor Kongming that uses Bei’s connection to the Imperial house to establish power in the Riverlands, in the west of the empire, to establish the kingdom of Shu-Han.  Yet if not for the alliance between the Riverlands and Southland against Cao Cao in the battle of Red Cliffs, the three-fold division of the empire would not have happened.  After the death of Liu Bei and his sworn brothers, Kongming becomes takes up their cause by his six campaigns against Cao-Wei are not successful in conquering the whole of the Northern Heartland.  Upon Kongming’s death, the Sima family rises within the ranks of the Cao-Wei that they eventually usurp and reunify the Empire as the Jin dynasty. Though Luo Guanzhong wrote his masterpiece roughly 1200 years after the events of the novel, he used extensive historical records plus numerous legends and popular stories from the period to enhance Three Kingdoms.  The resulting novel is considered seven parts history and three parts fiction, the later portions surround the adventures and actions of Lord Guan and Kongming respectfully whose impact on history was either enlarger or their effectiveness increased.  On top of that Luo Guanzhong, along with Mao Gonggang who edited the text a century later, had a political agenda to favor Liu Bei over Cao Cao that giving the former great virtue while the latter is considered a usurper.  The four-volume 2339-page novel is an engaging piece of historical fiction with a lot of annotation, by Mao Guanzhong and translator Moss Roberts, though it isn’t perfect.  From the text itself, there are hundreds of named characters though most of them are minor characters that are hard to keep straight through the major and secondary characters are easy to keep straight.  The Chinese name convention of surname given name is followed throughout and after a while it’s easy to get use to; however one of Luo Guanzhong’s decisions was to have some individuals have multiple names, most notably Liu Bei (Xuande) and Kongming (Zhuge Liang) that at times confuses the reader.  The majority problem with the novel is unfortunately the Foreign Language Press edition that I read had grammatical and spelling errors on almost every page that too be fair was easy to read through but was a tad annoying. Three Kingdoms is a Chinese historical classic novel that I found to be a very readable novel thanks to the true to original translation approach of Moss Roberts that gave Luo Guanzhong’s masterpiece it’s full meaning.  Though most of my issues are due to the publisher’s grammatical and spelling errors, they didn’t takeaway from the great historical story that was presented and gives the reader an insight into Chinese history and cultural thought.	1
misleading web page lead to a $26 penalty charge.	0
The cover of the book showing a bunch of giggling morons is enough to warn any serious reader that it is nothing but a collection of childish cartoons.	0
not was i was hoping for.  so many names after name.  like a chronology and not like a great flowing story.	0
Amazon seems to have combined more than one translation here, but DO buy the Moss Roberts translation sold by Foreign Languages Press. I have just finished reading volume 1 of this translation, comparing it word for word with a Japanese translation of the original medieval Chinese. The original language is hard to read, but Roberts nails it. I believe it will be hard to surpass the accuracy of this translation. The Beijing edition, the cheap one available here, contains all of the useful footnotes available in the UC Press edition, and relatively few typos. This classic epic novel is well-known to almost all educated people in East Asia, and if you have the time to focus on the text and remember the names of the characters, it is more engaging and thought-inspiring than a hundred books of political philosophy. Run, don't walk!	1
Like many other reviewers, the way I first found out about this book was through the Dynasty Warriors video game. I decided to try reading the unabridged version, though somewhat daunted by the size. I did expect the book to be interesting, but I also thought it would be difficult reading. Little did I expect for the book to far exceed my expectations! The Three Kingdoms is a fascinating look into the history (albeit somewhat fictionalized) of China during a roughly 100 year period between 180-280 AD, during which the Han Dynasty fell(the Han was the longest lasting and most powerful dynasty according to the Afterword). The book is full of stories of honor, courage, and loyalty; as well as betrayal, cowardice, and deception. Three Kingdoms is not just a book about wars, although battle is featured prominently in the book--it spends equal or greater amounts of time peering into the political intrigue, power-struggles, and military strategy. The book is loaded with characters, which presents probably the greatest challenge to a Western reader. Learning the names of the main characters might come easier than you might think, and there is a helpful list of main characters in the back of the fourth volume (though even many of those listed there appear only momentarily in the novel). I would also suggest reading the foreward and at least the beginning of the afterword in the fourth volume before beginning the book--it will give helpful background information. The storytelling in the Three Kingdoms is so compelling that I often found myself practically cheering for my favorite characters, and often laughing out loud at peculiar victories or witty dialogue. The beginning of the book focuses on Liu Bei (Xuande) a man of admirable character and virtue, but often frustrating leadership. The main body of the book deals with Zhuge Liang (Kongming), who is Liu Bei's military strategist. Kongming is definitely the most fascinating character, and his strategies and manipulation are delightful to watch unfold. The book also has scores of heroes and villains, and gives insight into the values and virtues that were highly regarded by the Chinese. Towards the end of the book the storyline briefly begins to sag as most of the main characters die off, and yet the characters Jiang Wei and Deng Ai redeem the end of the book, and still carry on the suspense and excitement that was stronger and brighter in the first 3/4ths of the novel. All in all I was disappointed when I finished, ONLY because there wasn't more to read! I would definitely read this book again and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a true epic of Chinese history.	1
This is an amazing historic, literary work. It is similar to Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (Based on history, but has many fictitious moments). This is my personal favorite set of books. I chose my major because of this work. Moss Roberts does a fantastic translation of a literary work that has helped shape China. The book opens with Liu Xuande (Liu Bei), Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei declaring their brotherhood. This work flows with strategy, both militaristic and political with many vying for power, with an unlikely force winning. In the end, the shadows are the way to gain overall power. This set comes with 2 books, with the first having a green cover and no real extras, and the second has a blue cover, with the conclusion and many extras, including definitions of titles, places, etc. Notes are also contained within the second volume, which greatly help in understanding the flow and historical background of the work, and a chronology of events is also placed in the second volume, with many other extras also included. Overall, an amazing translation of an amazing historic, literary work.	1
This translation of "Three Kingdoms", one of China's four great classical novels, is extremely accurate and reads excellently and fluently.  Roberts finds a middle ground between fidelity and spirit.  The language used is not archaic, yet the translation is faithful.  It remains one of the best translated texts of Chinese literature ever.  Roberts must be congratulated for translating a book that reads as well as it did in the original written six centuries ago. Trouble is, the version Roberts translated wasn't, textually, what Luo Guangzhong really wrote.  It was a text embellished by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang at the start of the Qing Dynasty circa 1660, 150 years after the most ancient extant text was established, that of the Jiajing Renwu edition (1522).  The 1522 edition (preface dated 1494) is known as the "Sanguo Tongsu Yanyi" (abbreviated TS by Roberts). All credit to Roberts, he discusses, with great scholarly attentiveness, the differences between the 1660s Mao edition and 1522 Jiajing Renwu (Tongsu) edition in an informative afterword.  Roberts said that the differences and literary merits were disputed amongst scholars.  But for people wanting to read a version truer to Luo Guanzhong's vision, the Maos' version is certainly an embellishment, if not an outright revision.  The differences are not minor. The question we should ask today is, should we be reading the Maos' revision of the original novel in c. 1660, or Luo's own (written around 1400)?  There are people who advocated the Mao version as the superior, more literary edition.  This is no different from scholars who used to "edit" Shakespeare to make him more palatable to the tastes of their times. What the Maos did was to add their own judgments to the text.  Luo's TS version of 1522 paints a more accurate historical version of the characters, from the historical annals Sanguo Zhi.  Some people may argue the characters might be drier, but the Maos' changes reflect their own tastes and political allegiances.  The Maos were clearly pro-Liu and anti-Cao.  Cao Cao became Public Enemy No 1, Liu Bei the embodiment of righteous dynastic rule; Guang Yu and Zhuge Liang were deified.  They divided the book into 120 chapters (the TS version was in 24 scrolls and 10 parts each (ie. 240 parts). The Maos changed 10-20% of the text.  The effect is cumulative in such a long work as Three Kingdoms.  The characterizations are changed quite drastically. To Roberts' credit, he does provide footnotes where the 1660 revised edition differs from the 1522 version.  He is right too that the Maos edition remains the most printed and read version in China, such was its influence.  But to go back to the root of Luo Guanzhong's vision, one must translate the 1522 edition. Frankly, the 1660s version isn't that bad.  It's an embellished version, more literary, and may suit certain people's tastes better.  For one thing, the line: "The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide" isn't in the older version.  But since the 1522 edition almost definitely represent Luo's work more faithfully, readers should have their selection.  Since Professor Shen Bojun's magisterial edition of the Jiajing Renwu version appeared nearly two decades ago (which corrects technical errors, ie. errors in dates etc), the task shouldn't be that arduous.  80% of the text is already in the 1660s version.  Voice of hope, however idealistic: give us the Jiajing Renwu version and the Sanguo Zhi (the full historical annals) please, Mr Roberts!	1
Imagine my surprise when my eleven year old son placed a few names from a video game (Dynasty Warriors) into Google and came up with biographies of real Chinese warlords. Investigating I found that the game was based on Chinese Literature, a historical book written in the 1200s about 3rd Century China by Luo Guanzhong. My son promised he would read the book if I ordered it. The book as ordered is printed in China and is broken into four 600 page sections. I did buy it and with his background from the game he sailed through all 4 sections in record time with nothing but high praise. I have read it myself and highly recommend it to anyone. We have also purchased the TV serialized DVD collection, in Chinese with English Subtitles, which is absolutely facinating viewing for those who have read the original books. The DVDs require staying power there are 58 of them put out by Chinese government TV studios. The recording quality and the subtitle errors are a bit of a deterent to all but real Three Kingdom Fans. If you are expecting a slick Hollywood film don't buy the DVDs.	1
And it's about time too. Moss Roberts does an excellent job of translating the epic novel by Luo Guanzhong in a full, unabridged four book series. Previously I had read an abridged version by the selfsame translator, and while I was impressed with the story, it was too choppy to satisfy me. I later found this unabridged version, purchased it at once and loved every moment of reading. This is it. The definitive "Three Kingdoms". "The Three Kingdoms" is based on the era known as The Three Kingdoms period, or San Guo Yan Yi. This period chronicles the decline of the Han to the rise of the Jin dynasty (circa AD 170-260). The story tells the tale of protagonist Zhuge Liang (referred to as Kongming throughout the story) and his efforts to help his lord Liu Bei (referred to as Xuande throughout the story) unite the land and restore the crumbling Han. You see, Liu Bei is a distant cousin of the child emperor, Liu Xian, who is manipulated by the malicious despot, Cao Cao. Bei, a poor mat weaver, steps up to the plate and helps to put down the Yellow Scarf rebellion under Zhang Jue and the story takes off from there. Zhuge Liang does not actually come into the story until much later and dies in the middle of the fourth volume, but his importance is immeasurable. This story is a must-read for history fans as well as fans of any of the video game series about the time period (Dynasty Warriors, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dynasty Tactics, etc.). Fans of the video game series will love to hear tales of their favorite characters, such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and many more. An important thing to keep in mind when reading Luo Guanzhong's novel is that it is a biased account of the events. Luo Guanzhong is what I call a pro-Shuist, or someone who supports Shu (the kingdom ruled by Liu Bei), so Shu feats may be embellished and fans of the other kingdoms (Wei, Wu) might be frustrated as many of their favorite characters will not be viewed as positively as they may deserve to be. With this in mind, "The Three Kingdoms" is a fun, if not lengthy, read and will keep you turning the pages. The story isn't terribly difficult to follow but some may have trouble keeping track of the cast of characters (some 600 plus characters in all) and all of their names. What I mean by 'all of their names' is that the chinese had the surname (Zhuge), the given name (Liang) and a style (Kongming). Some officers are called by all three names and it can be difficult to follow. Zhuge Liang is called many things over the course of the novel, in addition to his surname, given name and style, but it shouldn't be to hard to follow. Probably easier then following my explanation of it, at any rate. My major complaint with this edition (and it is minor) is the poor proofreading and the poor quality of the paper and binding. This book was published to Beijing standards and would not meet American standards. You will have to be a little careful with the book while reading it, but that's not too big of a problem. Also, the typos (two or three a chapter) can get annoying and make you wonder who was proofreading the book and make you think that you could do a better job (and you probably could). That aside, this is a very enjoyable story and you will not be disappointed in buying the four-volume unabridged set translated by Moss Roberts.	1
One of the greatest of epic novels. I received this book as a gift, and I'll treasure it forever. I know I'll return to it several times in the future to reread it. The book is as long as five novels, but it's more fun than almost any five novels you could choose. The epic sweep through 110 years of Chinese history is amazing. The narrative is swift and compelling. The battles are spectacular and exciting. The characters--especially Kongming, Cao Cao, and Lord Guan--are wonderfully memorable and alive. The English translation, aside from a few typos and misspellings, is good. I don't speak Mandarin, so I wish someone would make a movie version of the story in English, or provide a subtitled version of one of the many Chinese screen adaptations. If I have one problem with the book, it's the character of Xuande. He's weak and indecisive, and lacks the qualities needed in an epic hero. It's hard to see what the other characters saw in him.	1
Like many people I first heard of this novel through the games from Koei. I played romance of the three kingdoms on my Nintendo when I was in high school. A few years ago I started playing the dynasty warriors series of games on the playstation. I had always wanted to read the novel, and I'm glad I did. The story starts around 185 AD, just at the end of the Han dynasty. It continues until the end of the Han dynasty in 220, and finally to the reunification of china around 280. The principle characters are rulers, generals, and politicians that make up the Wu, Wei, and Shu kingdoms. The book is really fast read, considering that the book is 2400+ pages long, it really didn't take that long to read. It is interesting and something is always going on. I don't think I would have enjoyed being a third century Chinese general. They have a pretty short life. It was kind of sad when character that I really like got killed, but considering the time span of the novel it was bound to happen. The novel does focus on the time period from 185-220, after that things start going pretty quick and after 235 AD the story is essentially over, except for a few details. I can't recommend it enough, you could read it 50 times and still get something out of it. If I were stuck on a desert island, this would be one of the books I'd like to have. Now all I need to do is visit china and see some of this stuff from the book	1
[This review is actually for the unabridged Moss Roberts translation] This book lives up to its reputation as a source-book for Chinese adventure, politics, history, culture and just plain swashbuckling fun. For the translator, it is a work of a lifetime - this comes from an amateur sinologist who remains daunted by the original texts of works such as Three Kingdoms. Roberts joins David Hawkes in the all-time Chinese translation hall of fame. For those interested in an introduction to the drama and adventure that provide the framework for Chinese thinking about large issues such as nation-building and nation-destroying, love, honor, war and peace, this is the ultimate guidebook. Long before Gibbon wrote the "Decline and Fall ..." and Asimov wrote the Foundation series, the Chinese were obsessed with the process of dynastic change and transformation in their own country. It is impossible to overstate the role of this work in Chinese culture -- it is as if everyone in the West actually grew up reading -- and loving -- the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the sweep of history, though, the personal is not lost. Personalities large and small march across the scene and the reader is swept up in their strivings to find a place and something to strive for as the structure of the world turns upside down. For the great Han Dynasty is falling, and no one knows what new configuration will take its place. Military and political geniuses, opportunists, men (and woman, who play a significant role) of cruelty and vision emerge to strive in a chaotic arena, seeking to make their mark on the new order to come. In this sense, Three Kingdoms is a human story which repeats itself again and again, but this is one of the bejewelled versions. Roberts' translation is accompanied by extensive endnotes, which are fascinating to the Sinologist, but which cannot help but distract from the action. Reserve them for later perusal. Finally, the translator has done a tremendous job of translating the poetry in the book - often used to eulogize heroes and martyrs who give their lives out of loyalty to their leaders or who go down fighting in a losing cause. These bits of verse help to cast the necessary sense of the futility of human strivings which pervades this work and the Chinese sensibility generally. The heroes see their own deeds as tiny drops in a great river of history, and their names to be forgotten in years to come. If Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang only knew how Luo and Roberts have extended their memory in times and worlds they could never have imagined.	1
First off, you have to read the full translation of this book.  I read the 1976 abridged version of Three Kingdoms translated by Moss Roberts first and thought it was pretty good, but felt that the story wasn't developed  enough and lacked cohesion.  Then a few years ago I finally found and  purchased the full unabridged version published by the University of  California Press and also translated by Dr. Roberts.  This is the  full-blown epic from start to finish with all the details and many of the  translation errors of the previous editions eliminated.  The prose was also  improved and flows eloquently throughout the book's entire 3000+ pages.  Three Kingdoms is the tale (part historical, part legend and myth) of the  fall of the Later Han Dynasty of China.  It chronicles the lives of those  feudal lords and their retainers who tried to either replace the empire or  restore it.  While the novel actually follows literally hundreds of  characters, the focus is mainly on the 3 families who would eventually  carve out the 3 kingdoms from the remnants of the Han.  The Liu family in  the Shu kingdom led by Liu Bei, The Cao family in Wei led by Cao Cao, and  the Sun family in Wu eventually led by Sun Quan.  The book deals with the  plots, personal and army battles, intrigues, and struggles of these  families to achieve dominance for almost 100 yrs.  This book also gives you  a sense of the way the Chinese view their history:  cyclical rather than  linear (as in the West).  The first and last lines of the book sum this  view up best: "The empire long united must divide..." and  "The empire long divided must unite..." If you are at least a  little interested in Chinese history (ancient or modern) and culture this  book is a must read.	1
When I first read Three Kingdoms it was quite a confusing story, what with all the endless characters that came and went, not to mention the impossibility of pronouncing their names properly! Nonetheless, I was captivated by the quality of the story, despite the very basic narrative style (being hundreds of years old) and the fairly simple way it must have been translated. With the amount of trials and tribulations that the reader witnesses in following the extremely incredible characters, it is no wonder that these real people from history mean so much to people today, nearly two thousand years later. Containing personalities of all kinds, Three Kingdoms offers so much wisdom and excitement, that once you get past the first couple of chapters, you are really drawn into a whole new world. To follow the struggles of men like Guan Yu, Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang as they fight for peace amongst the absolute chaos, gives hope and solutions to any of the problems one can face in today's world. Yet there are hundreds of characters who fight by their sides in attempts to reunite China, each having their own story to contribute to this immortal saga. It is truly a credit to Luo Guanzhong the way he managed to interweave so many storys, and yet stay prevalently factual. If you can get past the confusion and the slight redundancy of the narrative style, Three Kingdoms is a story you have to read within your lifetime, and preferably as soon as possible. According to DW3K.COM, there is a new version of Three Kingdoms that is to be released soon, designed to be more entertaining and less confusing than the 600 year old original. Apparently it will still contain all of the wisdom from Luo Guanzhong's, but will make a much more accessable and hopefully even more enjoyable way to learn about Three Kingdoms. In the meantime I can also suggest the other 3 chinese classics, in english known as Dream of the Red Chamber/Dreams of Red Mansions(Romance), Monkey King/Journey to the West (Adventure/Fantasy) and Water Margin/Outlaws of the Marsh (Adventure). Each are incredible stories in their own right, and are in many ways equal or even better than Three Kingdoms/Romance of Three Kingdoms.	1
Much better than Game of Thrones.  I read this book about ten times now.  I can't get over how good it is.  I've read over ten thousand books in my life time, and I have to say this is probably my favorite out of all of them.	1
I bought the book with some background of the subject(s) so I had a good idea of what it would be like. It is written differently than most American writers' style, which may be weird to somebody that does not realize how authentic the subject and writing actually is. The book is very detailed and for anyone that loves Chinese history of the 150-200 AD period, this book will give you a good description of it. The characterization and background of the main parties is very in-depth and you get a great idea of the temperaments for all the main characters. What keeps me from giving this a 5 star rating is that some words are missed due to translation errors, as well as some poor attempts at dramatizing certain moments. Other than those few awkward moments, I am really enjoying the books. I love the story, characters and overall cultural depictions.	1
Last year a friend of mine recommended this masterpiece of Roberts to me to sharpen my English and I found it's a masterwork as excellent as that of the original author about 500 years ago. It's said that the literature works belong to their own ethnic groups, their languages and can't be translated without losing or adding the meaning. But this epic translated by Roberts completely grasps the meaning of Chinese, both literal meaning, culture meaning and history background meaning of words, not only the surface meaning but also the deep meaning------the meaning in English is just the same as that in Chinese, no more and no less. If a Chinese author translated this middle-ages novel to modern Chinese as Prof. Roberts to modern English, he can do no more and better than Prof. Roberts. 30 years ago as a boy I read this Chinese epic of Luoguan Zhong but ignored the last 15 chapters whose content is about how "traitor" overwhelmed "loyalists" and not "political correct". But this English version read I from the 1st word to the last word including the annotation which contains many Chinese history events and lores even common Chinese don't know. The shortcoming of this translation is to non-Chinese readers, especially the English name of the people/place in this history fiction. I think western readers will be easily confused because when 30 years ago I firstly read this book I was also confused except tens of the main roles. But the translation of title is so cool. "''"(['kau'tsu]the earliest ancestor of this dynasty) and "'''''"([tai'tsu'wu'hug'di]the 1st emperor and the founder of this dynasty with many martial merits) is translated to "Augustus"-------the only and very  correct translation I think. In Chinese books about Julius Caesar Augustus in Rome history, "Augustus" is simply transliterated to "''''"[au'gu'si'du], because hardly a corresponding ancient Chinese title can be found , "'''''" is the fittest one.	1
This is the unabridged version and truly a masterpiece.  I was familiar with a very small portion of the history during this time period before I read it, so that encouraged me to try it out.  If you love epic stories, this is a great one.  Guanzhong based his novel on solid historical facts while adding some fictional elements in order to bring out the characters and events for the reader.  I've heard it said, and I agree with it, that it is 70% history and 30% fiction.  Addtionally, this is a must read for any fans of the Dynasty Warriors gaming series.  My recommendation is that if you have any interest in this period of Chinese history or stories of heroics and loyalty-to-the-death, buy it, and I guarantee that you wont regret it.	1
the other reviews probably say enough about the Three Kingdoms for me not to repeat them.  I came to this novel after playing the old Koei games, and I loved reading it. My only problem with the box set is that the books' format seemed very poor to me.  After paying 50 bucks (with shipping), it was a little disappointing to realize I only got three (yes three, though the entire novel was there.  I have no idea why it says "4-Volume Boxed Set") little paperbacks, with a very very small typeset on filmy paper that is very easy to smudge and smear.  Also, there are more typos than there are hairs in Cao Cao's beard.  Distracting. I don't think you should let this deter you from reading the three kingdoms.  But perhaps, if you know you're going to love it, you might want to wait until a much higher class version comes out than the one from the university press I got.	1
This book is a truly epic tale of ancient civilization. It is a historical fiction of roughly 180-280 AD (the period of the fall of the Han dynasty), with Liu Bei and "Peach Garden" brothers set as the heros. The plot of this 2000+ page tale centers around the political and military exploits of various leaders of the age. The dissolving the dynastic rule, the rise of warlords, and the subsequent consolidation into three major kingdoms. The story telling is superb, in echoing themes from earlier chapters, and for thematically bonding disparate events and characters. The story also mixes in many different observations into the nature of morality, politics, leadership, and loyalty. This translation seems to be based on the Mao edition, the footnotes are helpful for understanding the historical allusions and identifying where the fiction differs from history. This printing has a fair number of typos, that are sad, but not very detracting from the story.	1
Four GREAT Chinese classics roam over Chinese Literature, and among those (Romance of the three kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, the Monkey King, and ShueyHudran), Romance of the three kingdoms is deemed as second place, right after the Dream of the Red Chamber. It is a work in the plot of the Three Kingdoms history book, which is written in ancient Chinese and is thus very hard to comprehend. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms however, is a very intriguing accomplishment. However, if one read the translation version, one must bear in mind that there are lots names very similar. I myself have read the Chinese version, which made it much easier to comprehend. The storyline is an adventure, and a great warning to imperialism. The three kingdoms stand in enmity and eventually none of them won. This is the Three-Kingdom tragedy, and the end of the Three-Kingdom dynasty. Lots of symbolism and fables to be interpreted. Very thoughtful and comprehensive, all plot tied up extremely conherently. The characters, as far as I know, are all real. China could not have thrived without the greatness of the Three Kingdoms, for it developed numerous Chinese proverbs, numerous location names, and numerous Gods to be worshiped. It is one of the greatest classics in the world, and it must be savored - every bit of it.	1
You should. Three Kingdoms is the number 2 bestseller in the history of mankind after King James Bible. Couple billion readers cannot be wrong so have your faith in this book. Three Kingdoms.... I read it about 8 times now. Everytime I read it, I learn something new or see a different point of view according to my own maturity. You can talk about Tolkien, Jordan, Martin and other masters of fantasy novels but unless you read this one, you don't know what the hell you are talking about. Part fiction, part history, get ready to immerse yourself in epic that is equal to none. You have just found the book of your dreams.	1
I first became familiar with the Three Kingdoms period through the video game "Romance VII" (on PS2). Through the game, I was able to understand what each charecter is capable of doing, which illustrated a clear narrative of the basic concepts involved. After playing "Romance VIII" & "Romance X", I more or less understood what the novel had to offer. After playing these games, I decided to go to the main source - the novel. While reading the novel, I started associating the images and scenarios from the games with the text. Although you will know how most events will unfold, the endless names, ranks, locations and procedures, will make sense; which without, you will be bored to death. So to sum things up, I highly recommend you play some of the romance games (in particular "Romance X") so to know how significant some events (like the meeting of the brothers, or the battle with the 'strongest man under heaven') are.	1
The story itself is amazing, the translation lively and I like that it had little pictures once in a while to give me a picture in my head of what these characters looked like. HOWEVER...There are quite a few spelling mistakes, out-of-place words, and mixed up letters (b,d and p,q).  I bought a set directly from China so I'm not sure if the edition for sale in North America has these flaws.  They don't cause any major comprehension problems, but they're frequent enough for me to knock off 1 star. Still, this is the translation you should get, even if their proof-reader should have been fired.	1
I got this a while ago and it was a great read if you have ever played any of the dynasty warriors games you might want to check this set out it is a good deal don't miss out on it.	1
I first was introduced to this story by first playing the the game Dynasty Warrriors 2 for Playstaion 2.... Even though I am not finished with the three volumes so far it has been excellent and very detailed for an a historical story that happened about two millenia ago.  I am now on the second volume and won't stop till I get to the end. One thing about these books is that it is very difficult readed and not that easy to follow at times because the names of the people can get confusing the chinese has their names, last name first and given names following and also the people in this story sometimes are called by a second name which is common in the chinese culture.  One would have to read these books at least two more times after the first to get the story down because according to my mother my grand father had read the same story in China and told my mom that he had to read it a few times to fully understand this complex time in the history of pre-feudal China and a story still being studied militarily and historically to this day.  In a nutshell dispite the difficult read and complex story which I found to a challenge it is excellent and did not before starting expect it ot be easy, is excellent for someone who wants to be challenged whether or not they have played the game or who just is intrigued by an important time in the history of China.  It is good for people just learning about this country or for some who like me have played the game and is caught by the intriguing story that the game was based on.	1
What of the typos and errors? whine some reviewers. "Or the tediousness of the story as a whole?", cry others. One even proposes the introduction of a television show based upon the events of the Three Kingdoms, so as to alleviate the "dullness" within this epic. So, before I begin my review, I must submit a brief warning:   If you possess the attention span of a five year old, have the vocabulary skills of a newborn (all errors can be corrected mentally, within seconds of their discovery)or prefer movies to books, than this is not for you. Hopefully anyone that suffers from all three ailments has not defiled this book by even considering its purchase. Enough ranting. To the book itself.   This is a passport to the ancient China of lore, where great heroes mingled with Taoist sorcerers, where the pageantry and lavishness of the Emperor's court was matched only by the suffering of the peasants at the other extreme. This is the China of the treacherous yet mighty Lu Bu, the wise Zhuge Liang, and the ambitious Cao Cao. And lastly, this is the China of the Three Kingdoms: Wu, Wei and Shu.   From the rout of the Yellow Scarves in the opening scenes of the novel to the fall of Wu and the unification of the Empire over a hundred years later, this story flows seamlessly, intricately weaving the clash and bloodshed of battle with the scheming and intrigue that fills the tale's early pages. This is a blend of fiction and fact, after all, so Luo Guanzhong does not have the ability to twist the plot in any one direction (though Liu Bei emerges as a hero to Cao Cao's brutal villain)and so some of the lesser fights are told matter-of-factly.   However, there is something about The Three Kingdoms - the Taoist magic, the great warriors, the colorful picture that the author paints of palace life - that keeps it fresh, and wipes away the dryness that fills other legends. While Jiang Wei's endless string of defeats at the end of the novel appears to grow old, it is only because the reader has grown so attached to the Kingdom of Shu that its losses are your losses, and so, when Liu Shan capitulates so suddenly, you are disgusted. But it had to occur, did it not? As promised in the novel's opening line: "The empire, long united, must divide. The empire long divided, must unite. So it has been..."	1
I'll admit, I purchased this novel because of the addictive Playstation 2 games put out by Koei that are based on the Three Kingdoms story and characters.  Even being relatively familiar with the characters and plot, I found the novel to be very difficult to digest, if only because hundreds of characters are introduced (and often killed or left behind) every few pages.  The storyline is vivid and interesting, and this is an excellent novel.  This version is very helpful due to extensive endnotes and a preface and afterword that fleshes out the background and meaning of the novel.  I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in political and military adventures, but you should be prepared to invest substantial amounts of time in reading it.	1
It is an excellent novel and the translation is great. When I read the story, I felt like I traveled back to the history, and witnessed the events unfolding in front of my eyes. The story depicts the loyalty, integrity, sacrifice, friendship, betrayal, treachery and human fragiltiy. Today, I can not imagine someone  can match the characters of Lord Guan and zhao Zilong for their loyalty, integrity, courage, and sacrifice. I was also amazed , perhaps, intrigue about the Emperor Xian who somehow could not seek the service from Li Xuande and his people. Perhaps, the Chinese history would have a new twist if Emperor Xian had used Li Xuande to protect the Han dynasty.  Sum it up, the reasons or culprits that led to the collapse of the Han dynasty or any other dynasties later in Chinese history were due a weak ruler, abuses of power from eunichs, or misuse of talents in the court. The irony is nobody could imagine that, in the end, the entire realm was united by Sima Yan to found the Jin  dynasty but not by Cao cao, or Li Xuande or Sun Quan as the three main characters in the story of the three kingdoms that fought against one another.	1
I have just finished reading this book and was moved to make a comment. First of all, I want to say that this is a complete version of  "Three Kingdoms", not an unabridged one. The Foreign Language Press published this English translation made by Moss Roberts, in four volumes and 2340 pages, which include many notes, several drawings and some maps. The edition was very carefully done. About the content, I just can say that it is a monumental painting of humanity made through the light of a very difficult time in China history. One hint: at the end of volume four, a list of principal characters is included, which results very useful along the reading. As always, thanks to Amazon that brought this book to my hands.	1
This book is based on the critical time at the end of the Han Dynasty. It all starts with the Yellow Scarves Rebellion lead by Zhang Jiao and his two brothers, Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang , plung the land into complete chaos. Answering the call of duty, three sworn oath brothers , Liu Bei , Zhang Fei , and Guan Yu , go to fight the menece, along with thousands of others. After that was done , Dong Zhuo , an Imperial General, was controling the Emperor like a puppet. Him and his mighty step son, Lu Bu , take control of the Imperial Court. To Stop these traitors , many great generals,  Including Cao Cao , Sun Jian , Liu Bei , and many more with the chosen leader, Yuan Shao, destroy these verman. From these events comes a chain of cause and effect that, basicly , leads to the collapseof the , once great , Han Dynasty .  Best book I've ever read, EVER. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 15.	1
I don't want to leave a long comment because the truth is the book is a great classic. My only problem with it has been constant grammar errors. Once Lord Guan Yu is referred to as Lory Guan Yu, and just things like that. In fact, on the back of the book their is an error in the first line, so I will say that I wish the editor would have done a better job with the errors, but other than that, it's flawless!	1
First off, I'd like to say I do enjoy this book and the history behind it.  I am a history major and plan on being a novelist someday, writing ancient historical-like novels.  Thus this, and several other books, are prime for my reading list... but as a general novel I found this book lacking.  This is probably because it is translated but I found this book to be choppy as well as lacking in descriptive writing.  Sword fights between two major figures last for one or two sentences max.  There aren't any vivid descriptions of anything.  I'm not someone who needs two pages describing a flower (the worst case of long unnecessary description I've come across), but I would like to know what a character looks like more than just his height, or what a building or city looks like.  Surely major battles involving thousands shouldn't start and finish in one or two pages.  I suppose that this story could have been twice as long had he allowed descriptions, but I would have enjoyed it a bit more.	1
I think 3 kingdoms is a different type of novel from the Western traditional style .It doesn't focus much on the personal of characters:their feeling ,thoughts... because it has to deal with hundreds of them.The book itself is a page turner , there are many things which are repeated many times but you nerver feel boring.   In chinese we called 3 kingdoms as 70% facts, 30% myths.The main character is considered Kongming: --Kongming , a brilliant military leader and politican ,but his talent was exaggerated in the book, in formal history ,his main credit was to save the kingdom of Shu from the Wei's menace. --Sima Yi :this man is a master schemer,a superb politican and military leader.  Sima did not want a total war with the Shu because as long as Kongming ramained a menace to  Wei kingdom , he is  still useful with the Cao's family.And by distinguised himself by battles with Kongming , he gradulally gained control of the Wei ,and finally it was the Sima's family who unitied China and declared themself emperor. --Cao Cao: the Chinese love this man ,his brilliant as well as his ruthless.He was never a king , but one of the most emperor in China's history changed his nickname to Cao Cao , and Mao ZeDong writes poems to praise him. Cao Cao was extremely suspicious :" I would rather betrayed the world than have the world betrayed me". A good comapre to Cao is Stalin.	1
I've read many classics such as Don Quixote, War and Peace, and Guilliver's Travels.  None of these is as readily accessible to younger readers as this set of books is.  There is more action in one page of this book than any book I've read before.  And similarly, the dialogue is quick, to the point, and wastes few words.  Descriptions are minimal, explanations brief, and intrigue constant.  If you're someone (like me) that grew up on video games and television, this is likely a book you'll easily get into, likely enjoy, and almost definitely learn much from. Why the heck couldn't we have read books like this in school?	1
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is my favorite Chinese literature. This is one of the best classic's in Chinese history. This 4 volume set tells you one of the bloodiest war in ancient China. This is a MUST READ if you are into Chinese classics. From the uprising of Shu, Wei, and Wu and the to the unification of the whole three kingdoms.	1
The title of this review truly says it all for this martial epic. One would not make an overstatement by comparing this bbok to such powerful works of literature as the iliad or the nibelung.Everything from characters to plot is richly portrayed.Characters are epic and complex and he storyline is iaginative and rich. The only chinese novel that cann supposedly surpass this book is The Dream of the red chamber and I can't wait to read it	1
Having read both the original Chinese text and Mr. Roberts' accurate translation, I can say without hesitation  that Mr. Roberts' achievement is nothing short of monumental. If you want to understand China and how  Chinese think, this book is a must.	1
The Three Kingdoms have been, since its creation, the staple of literature in the Orient. It has been translated into Korean, Japanese, and numerous other languages and has been read by scholars, historians, and military strategists everywhere in Northern Asia. However, as anyone who has already read the Three Kingdoms in any of the North Eastern Asian languages will promise, the English version unfortunately does not capture the essence in which the "Odyssey" of China rose to its widespread fame and ubiquity. It lacks the characterstics that demand to stand as one of the greatest historical and legendary pieces in existence today. That is why it is literature, not simply history. The artistic hand of Luo Guanzhong is almost wiped off and a bland history with awkward word choice is left that leaves little to imagination and wonder. For people who are interested in the epics of Chinese literature, to gain a simple understanding of the events and perhaps some of the strategies, the book can be recommended. However, to truly appreciate the epic that has created sayings that if you read the story three times, you can be deemed a scholar, the translation simply lacks too much. It is unfortunately, another case of great literature unable to be shared since it was lost in translation.	1
These books are telling a story about what happened in the late Han Dinasty. Full of dramatic event, magnificent stategems implemented and actually fun to read as long as you have stamina to do it since it is a really thick for every volume.	1
probably the most popular novel in china , vietnam , japan,korean...... this is a wonderful book , maybe the greatest book i have ever known. Seeing  some reviews said that Liu Bei is the main hero of the novel ,in China we disliked and considered him a man who know nothing but cry and a demagogue . the  most fascinating character must be Cao Cao , the translation missed some quotes of him , and even the famous seven battle of Kong Ming with the barbarian ,of which he captured the rebel's leader ,realesed him ,and then recaptured..... Even with the best translator there are still some  poems, words.... that seem impossible to translate into  english , if you know chinese try to buy this book in chinese.	1
I am a normal 15 year old boy who likes china.  And let me tell you somthing this book is the best book ever!! It has a huge stand point on war and art. This book is the Unabriged version and has a lot of names but you will get the main people in the story. For any of you who have played the viedo game, forget everything you know because it's alot different. I give this book 5 out of 5. The version should be bought because Robert Moss has about 200 pages of helpful quotes, pictures, and maps.	1
It fits its hype of being one of the four Chinese classics. It takes you back in time and shows the culture, drama, and situation of China around 190 to 220 AD. You will find yourself reading the first chapter and not wanting to stop. The epic book does well by hooking the reader in.   However, there are many characters in which to remember. Luckily the characters themselves, can at many times, be distinguish from each other. Very good book indeed!	1
The story gets Five stars But the quality of the books gets a Three or Four. The pages are really thin and there are a lot words that are spelled incorrectly. Thankfully, the words are fairly easy to figure out, but having to solve the occasional word puzzle in the middle of the story can be quite annoying. This is still one of the greatest stories ever written and an excellent buy.	1
The Three Kingdoms is set right at the end of the Han dynasty and covers more than a century when the unity of China was broken.  Moss Roberts has done a good job translating this vigorous history of alliances, betrayals, bravery, cowardace, and greed.  It isn't exactly a historical novel as there are many supernatural elements, but you do get a good feeling of what life was like in those turbulent times. He cleverly puts the analytical essay at the end, since most of us wouldn't appreciate it if it had been at the beginning.	1
A+	1
The story is just beautifuly written. I love Chinese history and mythology and all that stuff and this was just... beautiful. I am really enjoying the work of these books and to all of you that like Chinese history and/or mythology, then please taky some time to read at least one volume of this series. The only thing is, the names may start to get confusing so if you don't have a very good memory, then it will get very confusing about who's who. Other than that, this was perfect.	1
This Book is one of the best books ever you know... Since i got the games by koei man I know alot about what happens in the game and I got a English-Korean-chinese-Japanese translated.. thats how much i like the book... It my ship like in 3 weeks...well on a scale of 1-10 i give it a 13...Seehow good it is...I don't Like reading only games but this book i read about 6 times it sooo gooooddddd....	1
I have been seeking to this book for a while. Now that I have gotten far into it, I can honestly say that this is a great book for anyone that has heard about it or just curious about it. It's just great!	1
This is definitely good book for people who want to learn history of china and from this book, you can also find some very helpful information and methods in your daily life. You should not only read this book but also you should keep a copy of it on you desk.	1
I love history.  Now when I read this Novel, I was in heaven.  I mena I read about the defeat of Mengde (Cao Cao) at Red Cliffs, I red about the Death of Kongming (Zhuge Liang) with great sadness.  I efinately recommend this novel to anyone.  Even if they don't like histoy, they should still find theis to be a great read.	1
The book is set an ancient china from 184a.d. to 236a.d. or something like that. the reason i got into this is because of Koei's Dynasty Warriors series especially 3. It has political features and also has a bunch of betrayals.	1
I am a big fan of The Three Kingdoms saga.  I wanted a version that in my mind was worthy of the wonder and significance of the work.  This version, for the cost, is very disappointing.  I am through the first nine chapters or so, and I must say that this version does not live up to expectations.  I see typographical and spelling (!) errors on seemingly every other page.  There are also numerous references within the text to other works and versions that make me think there have to be more comprehensive, superior versions out there.  I wanted a version that I could hang onto for decades, something worthy of prominent display on my bookshelves, and this one isn't it.  If you are new to the ROTK world, this could be a great introductory work, but only if it were $40 cheaper.  Avoid and instead try the local library.	0
The history (being in the non-biased form) was even more empowering than the fictional editions of, "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms"... A textbook for honor and duty.	1
Entertaining.	1
My love for tea brought me to explore the Chinese antiquity more and more	1
Three Kingdoms in CHINA --san guo yan yi--, its contents 70% are true and 30% fictive.Other history book --san guo zhi-- by Chen Shou (233`297),if you like Three Kingdoms,you should read this book.	1
One of the best stories I've ever (I don't read that much though).It makes you think that you have actualy witnessed it and to some can be found quite sad (not me).It's a bit complicated and to think but thats what i like about a book.	1
The post office lost the original order, and their customer service was completely unresponisive- This left me very frustrated, and just about ready to throw up my hands, until I contacted Amazon. They not only fixed the problem- they did it almost instantly, and with a smile. The books arrived a few days later, in perfect shape- thanks amazon! (Also, the Books are great!)	1
First off, I want to make it clear that I respect the people who love and enjoy this novel. I do not think that their opinion of it is somehow "wrong." The following, however, has been my experience: Among East Asian classics, and among Chinese classics, this novel is one of the least accessible to the average English-speaking reader. The way in which the story is told is extremely dry and downright baffling to someone schooled in Western literature. The writing had no emotional resonance ever. The lack of emotional resonance is expected, seeing as there's very little description of anything beside physical occurrences, which are summarized in very succinct form. (i.e. Character 435 stabbed Character 762, then rode to [the city of] JFDFSDG and stabbed Character 953). This sort of sentence compromises the entire book. Basically, it reads like a reference work. It's not a "novel" as most western readers would be accustomed to thinking of one. Even if you're open to forms of literature that are drastically different from anything else you've read (as I was, going into this), you'll probably find yourself too exasperated by the novel to finish. It was really a painful experience for me. However, all is not lost for the person seeking an entry into Chinese literature. I recommend Dream of the Red Chamber as a good starting novel, especially the translation published by Penguin under the title "The Story of the Stone" (don't be discouraged by the alternative title, it's the same novel as Dream of the Red Chamber). Furthermore, Red Chamber was written in the late Qing, which makes it more relevant to the modern history and identity of the region we know as China. Those looking for older quality pieces of writing from East Asia as a whole may enjoy The Tale of Genji and The Tale of the Heike more than they would enjoy Three Kingdoms. Both "Genji" and "Heike" are lengthy novels of Japanese origin, with Genji often being considered the world's first written novel, and certainly the first in East Asia. To all, Good luck in your readings.	0
I have not bought this kindle version.  I almost did, but i previewed it first. If the preview reflects the final product, then this is appalling. How can amazon put this up for sale? PREVIEW IT BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT.	0
Book is well written and fairly easy to understand. I mainly just love the subject matter.	1
seller worked with me in a calm and speedy manner while thanksgiving was going on to resolve a shipping issue. product arrived very fast and in great condition.	1
One of the greatest book of Chinese literature	1
good books	1
I'm assuming anyone interested enough to read through reviews of Three Kingdoms needs no convincing in terms of the story itself. It is, without questions, a superb epic and more than worth anyone's time (of which you will need a lot if you are to finish it). In light of this, my review will focus specifically on Moss Roberts's unabridged edition of Three Kingdoms. To anyone wondering whether to go with Brewett-Taylor's 1920's translation or this one, I say look no further. To begin with, Moss Robert's translation uses the all but universally adopted system of Pinyin, whereas Brewett-Taylor's (published before Pinyin was devised) used the Wade-Giles romanisation system - now out of use everywhere except Taiwan. Thus, when Moss Roberts writes "Cao Cao" and "Sima Yi", Brewett-Taylor writes "Ts'ao Ts'ao" and "Ss'uma Ii". Not only are the Pinyin names in wider use now, they are also easier to read. Secondly, the language is far more accessible in the Moss Roberts version. This is not to say that it is dumbed down - quite the contrary. The translations of the poems and couplets are beautifully rendered and capture the emotional tone conveyed in the original Chinese very well; they even rhyme most of the time. Lastly, this revised edition contains a long list of vital characters, footnotes, an expanded set of illustrations and maps (the maps come in handy when trying to visualise key battles and events). There is also a superb afterword which, at 120 pages long, does a great job of contextualising the novel in terms of its place in Chinese culture and historiography. It sorts fact from fiction, for anyone interested in the historical aspect of the novel (it is, after all, a romanticised and often fictionalised account of the period). These three facts alone place the updated Moss Roberts edition far above Brewett-Taylor's in my opinion. Nevertheless, this edition is not without flaws, and I would be remiss not to point them out. Firstly, there are the typos. It's a shame that the editor didn't or couldn’t to sift through them in earnest, as they are both numerous and grating. Secondly, the quality of the cover, the box and the paper, doesn't live up to the content - particularly given its cultural and historical significance. Lastly - and this is the big one - there are the spoilers. Yes, you heard me. The spoilers. While the introduction and the footnotes do a superb job of clarifying, contextualising and elaborating, they are also often guilty of revealing the turn of events long before the reader has got to that part of the story. Thus, we are told the ultimate fate of Liu Bei, Zhuge Liang, Cao Cao, the Wei, the Southland, and the Shu, far in advance of getting there ourselves. Unless Moss Roberts thought that only those already versed in the historical period of the Three Kingdoms would read this, I cannot fathom why he would deem it appropriate or even necessary to reveal such things to the reader without warning him first. I suppose this was published before the phrase *spoiler alert* was coined. I would therefore be inclined to recommend that readers who wish to remain unspoiled avoid the introduction and the footnotes sections altogether. However, given how useful the footnotes actually are (for the most part) in terms of aiding the reader through esoteric references to historical figures, historical events, and cultural themes, I cannot endorse that recommendation fully. It is a shame, because the footnotes are essential to all but the most well versed sinologists, and yet they ultimately rob the reader of the pleasure of being surprised at crucial points in the story. However, despite these flaws, I still loved Moss Roberts's edition. It's easy to tell how enamoured and engrossed he was by this story, and his passion shines through in this beautiful translation, promising to make for a spectacular read. I, for one, look forward to rereading it in the future.	1
I bought this way back in 2009, and I didn't finish it until 2012. I wasn't reading it continously the whole time - on and off, rereading parts when I left it for too long. I think I read the first volume 3 times. This generally is not a hugely enjoyable read, when reading it, but I'm still glad I did. There are 4 volumes in a slightly flimsy cardboard cover to keep them together. The pages themselves are extremely thin (paper-thin...), but even though I traveled a fair amount with some of these books stuffed in a bag, the pages never got ripped etc. The pages maybe need to be this thin so that the books aren't ridiculously thick. There are some pictures and maps in the books, but I didn't use them that much. You will need a second bookmark so that you can refer to the footnotes at the back of the book that are constant throughout the books. Often these footnotes give an alternative translation from another source, which aren't that useful, hut sometimes you need them - a character may have last appeared 1000 pages ago, and you need a reminder of who they are. The translation seems pretty coherent at least, but certainly doesn't portray the poetic nature of the original Chinese. At the time I bought this, there was one other translation version that the reviews said is more poetic (I think it has actually been uploaded to read for free online, since it's from the 1930's or something). I chose this one for no partucular reason, but for me I'm glad I did, because trying to read this is a semi-poetic language woypd have increased the challenge even more. But maybe that's just me, I couldn't finish LoTR...	1
Three Kingdoms is, for the uninitiated, a (partly fictional) account of the events leading up to the transition from the Han Empire to the Jin Empire in China during the last part of the 3rd Century.  The story is, in the Far East, an iconic tale, with characters and events spawning idioms and influencing the actions of strategists, general and rulers for centuries to come, not to mention the countless media interpretations, such as the John Woo  movie 'Red Cliff' and the video game 'Dynasty Warriors' series. The entire story covers almost 100 years, and the breadth of characters and affiliations in the era is so great that it was inevitable - in addition to bias - that the carriers of the tale would caricature most of it to create a simple 'good vs. evil' tale.  So, once the several hundred pages of set-up are complete - which is good in itself, as the united heroes face rebel Yellow Scarves, scheming eunuchs, evil Dong Zhuo, valiant Lu Bu and arrogant Yuan Shao - the story turns into a struggle between the virtuous Liu Bei, the treacherous Cao Cao, and the opportunistic Sun Quan.  But it's the supporting cast that really make the story work; the iconic Guan Yu and Zhao Zilong, the semi-comedic Zhang Fei, and the multi-gifted strategist Zhuge Liang carry Liu Bei's cause, fearsome Zhang Liao, enduring Zhang He and the Machiavellian Sima Yi fight for Cao Cao, while the jealous genius Zhou Yu, painfully noble Huang Gai and prodigy Lu Xun support Sun Quan.  And that's nowhere near all.  None of the portrayals are historically accurate - some being downright unfair - but it makes an epic read nonetheless. The main attraction is the lack of that aforementioned simplicity, however; the Wu kingdom provide the Liu Bei cause with the ally they need to defeat Cao Cao at Red Cliffs, but end up being the cause of his downfall later as the two sides argue over the provinces of Jingzhou.  And after that, well... read and learn.  The 'plot twists' of this 3-way power struggle are pretty much the bait and hook, with the fate of Guan Yu needing especial mention. It has to be said, however, that for some readers, the style may be uncomfortable (not to me personally, but other people I have shown the book to have said this).  The story often shifts between the different groups, sometimes covering three or more sets of characters at once, and many amount to nothing more than exposition.  This version also features a lot of translations of poems and sayings that can, to anyone not interested in Chinese culture, seem superfluous.  The final 15 chapters also lack the scope of the earlier ones, as all of the main characters are no longer present for whatever reason.  Repetition is something else I hear aimed at this novel; well, history has an annoying habit of repeating itself, with generation after generation refusing to learn from very-well-documented mistakes.  This is, in fact, part of the point the novel makes, with mistakes seen at the start being repeated by the next generation at the end, with similar consequences. All in all, this is a book I actually returned to more than once, and there's enough to keep a person looking for depth and scope reading for a long time to come (it's already been a staple read in China for 1700 years, so there you have it!). But for 'Reader Lites' out there, there are other ways to enjoy the story... other book translations, John Woo's Red Cliff, subtitled copies of CCTV's 82-part TV series, and I even understand there's a graphic novel version if you know where to look. Either way, give this tale a try; you won't be disappointed.	1
I bought this set of books a while ago because they looked interesting. I am also a huge fan of the war which happened in China as I played the Dynasty Warriors franchise from number 2 and have watched the red cliff films which are about the war. This book is well written and tells the war the right way which is very interesting and amazing to read. A truly inspirational book as it brings together different types of character and you see what way they approach the war and deal with it.	1
This set of books is defiantly worth the buy if you're into Chinese history and its ancient tales! However, i only give 4 stars to this product overall simply because the box the four books come in is very thin and not very well made, and the books themselves have paper that seems to be about the same thickness as bible paper :P But its not really a problem, just somewhat cheaply made to keep the cost down I suppose, but worth it :D Just be careful when reading not to tare pages :)	1
Edition is as described - what more could one want? Paper is a bit thin and cheap, but that doesn't really bother me	1
This isn't the full version. It's a stupid comic book despite the description saying it's the full book	0
Often the narrative is a little unusual when put into the modern context but if you have a love of history, or even just the video game "Dynasty Warriors" then this is the perfect book for you. Bit long though...	1
A huge novel.	1
brought this for my friend in poland and he said he F'IN loves it	1
Great item, and excellent customer service!!	1
Delivery was timely.  Book was in good condition, but I underestimate the difficulty in reading such small print in a tight format. The print was much too close to the spine to properly pick out the last words of a line. The book is much needed, so I ordered a more readable format.	1
No resulta sencillo traducir una obra escrita en chino del siglo XIV. La traducción de Moss Roberts  está considera por muchos como la mejor, fiel al original, fluida, con abundantes notas aclaratorias. La edición, en cuatro pequeños tomos, es muy manejable.	1
I am just one of the many people who enjoyed reading the Three Kingdoms. What I have to mention however is the terrifying amount of spelling mistakes and the bad overall quality of printing. To give you one of many examples: In Volume 1 about one quarter of the text section on a certain page was completely missing. Soon afterwards I discovered that lost part printed over the lines of the next page. Those pages were completely incomprehensible.I might just have had bad luck with my copy, at least I really hope no one else received one of those.	0
A very good translation, with notes amendments versions and expanding historical information. The full work in just four volumes.	1
Sehr hochwertige Aufmachung.  Top verarbeitet und gut verpackt. Es war ein Geschenk für meinen Schatz und er hat sich wirklich sehr gefreut.  Definitiv empfehlenswert	1
Those people who are upset about typos...it does not occur very often and any decently educated person should be able to self-correct the typos easily, so...suck it up whiners.	1
You haven't red that book yet? What are you waiting for? Although there is a lot of romance (not implicitly), the history facts are present and you can learn a lot in the department of human behavior and interactions.	1
I can say that for the price the quality is good indeed. The paper of the pages is thin but nevertheless it feels good to read. Actually it has it's good points because the Novel is quite long and like this it doesn't take up much space. That is helpful when you - like me - are a person who still likes to carry real books everywhere you go. All in all thumbs up!	1
I haven't even read the book but feels WORST and DISAPPOINTED. Why couldn you mention that this is completely pictures like the scanned pages... You can't zoom in or zoom out... Fonts are too small to read through. Very bad.	0
Along with the Water Margin, its one of the greatest chinese novels. It should be a must read. It arrived in one day in good condition	1
Wonderful introduction to Chinese history. Complex characters, detailed history and reads like a dream. A must for anyone interested in China.	1
While the story itself is a masterpiece, as well as it coming in an attractive box, this version has an issue making a segment of the story unreadable. Pages 336-374 are completely blank, folded into the spine of the book itself, or missing. It may have been just misfortune on my behalf, but this misfortune thoroughly ruined a good book for me. A smaller annoyance is the fact that the pages are so thin that the text from the other pages leak through quite easily.	0
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE SET WAS PRINTED IN CHINA,I WAS UNSURE ABOUT THE PURCHASE. I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE PRINT IS PRETTY GOOD AND ALTHOUGH THE BOOKS IN THE SET ARE 4, THEY LOOK LIKE AVERAGE BOOKS, NOT TOO BIG.	1
Die Bücher kamen in dem erwarteten Zeitraum an, haben eine gute Qualität und ich freu mich darauf sie zu lesen. Bisher waren keine Mängel zu erkennen und der Preis war wirklich angemessen.	1
Bought it for my son & it was exactly as he expected!!😊	1
Rapide et bon état	1
One of the best translations of a wonderful classic. I really love Three Kingdoms novel and is the third time I'm reading it.	1
good	1
One of the best books ever...a masterpiece. I really recommend it!! The translation is quite good indeed. A perfect 10.	1
This was exactly as ordered. This version is the correct and true interpretation of the original books. Very pleased	1
The delivery has been fast and punctual. The collection is in very good conditions. I recommend to use their services.	1
This is a semi-historical epic set about 1700 years ago, telling of the growth of factionalisation and political intrigue in China that resulted in outright war. Essentially this is a story of a number of heroic figures and the battles they wage with each other. The main characters are pretty interesting, particularly the deviously clever Cao Cao. But the story lacks the fantastical element of  Outlaws of the Marsh Vol 1-4 , or indeed its humour. It's certainly a more challenging read. The notes to the edition are excellent, so if you want to know about the history of this period and see this in a semi-fictional context -- think Tacitus  The Annals of Imperial Rome (Classics)  if you've read him -- then this is great. It just wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention for the 2,500 pages it takes to reach its conclusion.	1
Edtion sympathique, illustrée, au prix abordable. A lire avec les trois autres grands classiques de la littérature Chinoise, Outlaws of the Marsh, Journey to the West et A Dream of Red Mansions.	1
The original version is super.	1
4 tomes format poche. Satisfait	1
Il s'agit bel et bien de l'édition complète en quatre volumes sous coffret. Evidemment, c'est en anglais. It really is the complete publication in a four-volume set. Enjoy!	1
This was a Christmas present, and the recipient said it was super to read, so there is not much else I can say about it!	1
It takes well over 300 pages to get past the initial, and perpetual, internicine military battles and skirmishes, all of which are described summarily. When the book finally lets up on the constant military skirmishes and battles, it does so only briefly and in doing so becomes somewhat more nuanced with some scheming, lying, backstabbing, etc. Opportunism abounds in these sections and often, but not always, trumps loyalty and honor - changing factions and turning on one's leader is a fairly common occurence here. At 892 pages in, the book has only very briefly broken free of its military confines - Three Kingdoms mainly deals with a power struggle, the outcome of which is determined mostly through military actions. As far as I can tell, there is little to be found in the book that isn't related to this aforesaid power struggle and associated skirmishes and battles, so it's not going to appeal to people who are looking for something profound or insightful (outside of military tactics). Initially, I enjoyed the simple straighthtforwardness of it, despite finding it to be lacking in more subtle forms of expression, such as can be found in other classics such as The Tale of Genji, Hamlet, or The Brothers Karamazov, for instance. I've grown tired of it though as military scheming and fighting is virtually all the book is about and at that, it isn't done very well, especially by modern standards - just brief, matter of fact accounts along the lines of "Then he struck ××××× a single blow, and he fell dead from his horse." I usually have lots of patience for older literature (I read and enjoyed War And Peace,  Don Quixote, and the unabridged Life Of Johnson, and countless other old books, for example), but I fear my patience has run out here...essentally it's been a  waste of time and money (bought the whole unabridged Moss Roberts translation). I kept reading it due to all the positive reviews, hoping it would improve.	0
My fault but I didn't realise it was a comic/graphic novel.	1
本書は、いくつかある三国演義または三国志演義の版本のうち現在最も流布している毛本を底本とした全訳である。 また、毛本以前の版本との異同についても約150頁にも渡る注釈の中で言及されている。Moss Robertsによる本書は、前文に、中国での出版を前提に準備され、欧米の読者の便宜のために注釈が加えられたとある。本書の訳文とTaylorの訳文と比較すると本書の訳文の方が読み易いように感じる。ただ、Taylorの訳文の方がより格調高い文語文であるという見方もある。 　Robertsの訳文とTaylorの訳文とには地名・人名等の中国語表記に大きな違いがある。中国のピンイン(Pinyin)というローマ字表記法は1958年に制定され、1979年に正式採用されたため、Robertsは現在一般的なPinyin表記を採用しているが、Taylorは旧来のWade式表記を採用している。表音の意味ではWade式の方が読み易いが、現在入手しやすい中国語の辞書はピンインが一般的である。余談であるが、その他に繁体字版の中国語辞書で採用されている注音符号というピンインが制される以前の正式表記もある。 特に人名はスペルのよく似た別人との混同を避けるため、あるいは日本語版の三国志で慣れ親しんだ登場人物の誰にあたるのか特定するために、是非とも漢字表記を知りたくなる。そのような読者にはTaylorの訳は薦められない。ただ、辞書を用いずに中国語の原書または邦訳を傍らに参照しながら読む読者にはどちらの訳本でも構わないでしょう。	1
Although the it's not a side-by-side translation, the translator's grasp of Chinese language is top-notch, matched only by his creative English writing. As for the original book itself, it's very long story with hundreds of characters and twists and turns like the Game of Thrones, except the stories are based on a vivid part of Chinese history.	1

If you’re familiar with any Chinese folklore, it’s probably this story. But you probably know it as “Journey to the West.”  It’s not only been released in numerous editions as a novel, it’s also been adapted for film, stage play, and I’m sure there must be a video game of it out there. If you’re thinking, “Chinese folklore? Sounds boring.” Think again. This is a superhero story. Monkey, also known as the Monkey-King and “Great Sage Equal to Heaven,” is an immortal who has all manner of supernatural powers. He can fly. He can make copies of himself. He can transform himself—either disguising himself as another being or appearing as an inanimate object. He has an iron truncheon that can be the size of a sewing needle or a mile long and which is indestructible. Wielding said staff, he can defeat armies or deities. In fact, the flaw in this story isn’t a lack of adventure or thrill. On the contrary, it’s one adventure after the next. If anything, the flaw is “Superman Syndrome.” That’s what I call it when the hero is so ridiculously overpowered that even when he’s fighting gods, dragons, or whole armies there’s still no doubt about the outcome. Of course, the Monkey does eventually meet his match in the form of the Buddha. The Buddha defeats Monkey not in combat, but in a bet.  That event shifts the direction of the story. In the early chapters, Monkey is goes about heaven and earth arrogantly wreaking havoc. He’s not altogether detestable. He does have his redeeming traits, but he’s insufferably arrogant and mischievous. After he’s imprisoned following his run-in with the Buddha, a monk is assigned to go to India to bring back scriptures (hence, a “journey to the west”) to China. Monkey is assigned to be the monk’s guardian and along with two others that they pick up along the way (Pigsy and Sandy) the monk is escorted on his journey. The party faces one challenge after the next, and the trip is long and arduous. Some of the challenges require brute force but in many cases they are battles of wits. So while Monkey may be overpowered, he does experience personal growth over the course of the story. The story is told over 30 chapters, each set up with a cliffhanger. I enjoyed this translation by Arthur Waley. It is end-noted, which is useful given the historic and cultural nuances that may not be clear to readers. It should be noted that this is unambiguously a Buddhist tale. There is a bias against Taoists and other non-Buddhist religions evident throughout the story. It’s not just the fact that the Buddha easily defeats Monkey when no other deity or group of deities can, there’s a steady stream of anti-Taoist sentiment. So, Taoists and Chinese Folk Religion practitioners be warned, I guess. I would recommend this book for fiction readers, particularly if you have an interest in the superhero genre or Chinese literature.	1
This version of Journey to the West exudes a perfumed wind. Waley is the greatest of translators from Chinese.  While this is abridged and cannot match the magisterial but stiffer version of Anthony Yu, it is just right for an introduction to this fabulous work. Many who read this will want to tackle Yu. Many others would not wish it longer than it is. Waley occupies a happy position at the boundary between these two groups.	1
Wonderfully funny and sometimes poignant ancient classic novel about pilgrimage by the wild and resourceful Monkey King and the diffident Tripitaka, Monkey's nominal master. Here's one of my favorite quotes from the novel. "They travelled on for many days and autumn had already come when late one evening Tripitaka reined in his horse and said, 'Disciple, where are we going to halt to-night?'  'Master,' said Monkey, 'that is a question for ordinary men to ask, not for such pilgrims as we.' 'Wherein lies the difference?' asked Tripitaka.  'Ordinary people at this hour,' said Monkey, 'are hugging their children or cuddling their wives in soft beds under warm coverlets, lying snug and comfortable as you please.  But how can we pilgrims expect any such thing?  By moonlight or starlight on we must go, supping on the air and braving the wet, so long as the road lasts.’"	1
This is a funny book as well as quite a serious one. Keeping an open mind while reading makes for a better experience.  Monkey is a lot like you and me.  He does the hard work to become enlightened and a standout person only to become a stronger egocentric narcissus blind to the rights and feelings of others.  But he is finally chastised for his behavior and learns to be true to his word and use his powers to help others and in the process does not lose any of his essential essence that makes him who he is.  It is a fine tale masterfully written and fun to read.  There is a reminder here that we all have something of a “Monkey Mind” inside us.	1
Its journey to the west but in a more compact read.  The monk travels westward to spread buddhism but has quite a journey.  The read journey to the west is too long for undergraduate students.  So I can assign this to them since is only about 300 pages.  The full length translation by the same person is 4 volumes and about 1200 pages.  I recommend the full length version if you are reading for your personal enrichment of reading a Chinese classic.  If you just want a quick read to understand the legend better than any movie, TV show, or children's book, then this is a fine abridged version of the translation I enjoy most and bought the last time I was in China.  To be honest, none of the popular culture shows or childrens' books I have seen here, or in China, are anywhere close to the actual book.  They just borrow some of the characters and call it Monkey King.  This is the real deal and, thus, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! One of my favorites ever!	1
The pre-chosen descriptions of the plot mood, characters and pace that Amazon provides are no match for the wonder of the book. Monkey has entertained children and elders in China for 1000 years. There are movies, songs, and spin-off tales. Donnie Yen just did a new movie in 2014 based on this book,and in 2013 Journey to the West was released in theaters. That's the mark of a book with staying power!  It's a fun read with twists and turns and magic and all the splendor and wonder you expect from China 1000 years ago. Think of the most sensational and unreal Kung-Fu movie you ever saw with flying swords and beasts and rooftop fights, magic fists, Crouching Tigers and Dragons and mystery. That is this book in it's ancient glory. You may love this, or you may find your child enthralled with the characters, plot and wonder of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, or the Jade Princess, or the demon catcher...	1
Monkey is an incredible tale that I read as a child and am looking forward to reading again as an adult. I was so happy to see this reprint in paperback. The story itself is a wonderful comedic adventure that provides insights into Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism as well as satirizes Chinese society of the 16th century. Monkey is, as to be expected, hilarious. There are many reviews of the story if you search the internet, so I'll not waste your time writing what others have already written.  Just know you'll enjoy!	1
Some people know the character Son Goku, from the Japanese cartoon series Dragon Ball Z.  Others are familiar with Pokemon's Infernape.  And still more know a similar character from a TV miniseries shown in the US in 2001 called The Lost Empire.  Rumor has it that Jet Li will collaborate with Jackie Chan to portray a Sun Wukong-like character in the forthcoming movie The Forbidden Kingdom.  What fans of these characters may not know, is that they are all based on China's infamous Sun Wukong--or The Monkey King. The tale of the Sun Wukong is one of the four major Chinese literary classics.  His 81-chapter story, called Journey to the West (Xi You Ji), was written by Wu Chen-En  in the 1500s.  Monkey's legend is based on the true story of a well-known monk, Xuan Zang (602-664), who traveled to Inida to bring the Sutra--the Buddhist holy book--to China to enlighten the people and improve their lives.  In Journey to the West, however, reality gives way to a much more entertaining and fantastic version of the story. Journey to the West is a hero's quest, elaborated with Monkey's supernatural powers, interlaced with Taoist and Buddhist practices and beliefs as well as common superstitions, embellished with fairy tales, monster stories, legends, and fables.  Some of the chapters read like superhero comics, others like instructional Bible stories.  Some parts of the story, as when Monkey, Pigsy, and Sandy are hiding in a Temple and outwit the priests, are downright hilarious.  The Sun Wukong legend can be read as a hero-journey-quest, a political and social satire of rebellion against a corrupt government, or as pure fancy.  No wonder Journey to the West has endured for so long. It's hard to believe that as popular as Journey to the West has remained over the centuries, its author would never have admitted to writing it.  Wu Chen-En was a scholar and a statesman.  During the 1500s (Ming Dynasty), it was considered unfit for educated and high ranking men to read any kind of comic or popular literature.  Wu was influenced in writing this tale by the super-hero stories he read secretly while in school. The entertaining escapades of Sun Wukong have remained popular through the ages, inspiring operas, cartoons, and now movies.  The tale has even spawned a Sun Wukong festival, which features recreations of many of his adventures, and a statue of Monkey stands at a Buddhist temple in Sau Mau Ping in Hong Kong.  Chairman Mao was also a fan, who mentioned Monkey as a role model in many of his speeches.  He said people should emulate Monkey's fearlessness in thinking, doing work, striving for his objectives, and extricating China from poverty.  Sun Wukong is well-known and well-liked in modern times among children in Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, and Korea.  I think Wu Chen-En would secretly be very pleased!	1
Monkey (or the Monkey King or The Journey to the West) is one of the great epic novels in Chinese culture.  Set in the 6th century, but not written in the current form until the 16th century (it was part of an oral tradition before that), the story is on the surface about the pilgrimmage of a Buddhist Priest, Hsuan Tsang, and his 3 disciples/side-kicks: Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy, as they journey to India to bring back sacred scrolls from Buddha.  Arthur Waley has done a truly impressive job of translating, editing, and bringing to life a selection of the stories (30 from 100 original chapters) from the original Chinese book.  He retains the complete first section about Monkey:  How he was born from a stone, the trouble and mischief he caused on earth and in heaven, and how he reached the title of Sage, Equal of Heaven until getting imprisoned in a stone under a mountain.  Waley then presents a selection of the adventures that the 4 cohorts encounter in their journey to find the scrolls.  Each of the adventures follow the same theme of encounter a difficulty, i.e., some people in trouble, help the people to overcome the difficulty, usually through magical or supernatural powers, and then move on.  By translating an abridgement, it prevents this repetitive style from dragging on, and it stays fresh.  In addition, to the basic story line, one learns much about ancient Chinese culture, Buddhism, and some about Taoism.  Moreover, the 4 pilgrims rather than being model characters are actually quite flawed, which makes the stories fascinating, because it always requires a group effort to surpass each hurdle.  This is a wonderful book.  Translating from contemporary Chinese to English is difficult enough, but from 16th century Chinese, Waley has done an amazing job.	1
Monkey is the story of the Monkey-king, acting as a guarding of a Buddhist monk in his travels to the west. Don't let this description mislead you. It is not a lofty, religious book. It IS an action-packed adventure thriller, with some touches of philosophy and fantasy. What I liked most about this book it is that it does not obey the norms (or guidelines) of western literature. The heroes can be cowards, betrayal is completely expected, good and evil are not opposites. Very refreshing, and keeps you on your (mental) toes. Highly recommended!	1
Mama used to read "between bites" at the dinner table to keep seven kids quiet and interested, and let Dad enjoy his dinner. She looked for books that had a beautiful flow to the language that would attract even the baby, simple enough basic story lines that the little kids would enjoy it, enough adventure to attract the middle kids, and deeper, subtler meanings to engage the older kids and adults. This one, Monkey, by Wu Ch'eng-en, translated by Arthur Whaley, was top contender, and I heard it read aloud many times in my childhood, always with enjoyment, always learning more. (The other most-repeated books were Kipling's Kim and Tolkein's The Hobbit.)   It is the story of the irreverent magic Monkey King who had adventures on earth, tricked a sage into teaching him the secrets of magic and immortality, and then created havoc on earth and in the beaurocracy of heaven. (Mama explained that the idea of beaurocracy is deeply ingrained, and that people tend to imagine their afterlife to be ideal versions of what this one might be.) As punishment Monkey was imprisoned for 500 years under the Mountain of the Five Elements, and as penance was to accompany and protect the priest Tripitaka on a journey from China to India to bring back copies of sacred scrolls, to bring the true teachings of the Buddha to China. They had adventures. And the author pulls us from one to the next with hints. ”If you do not know how far they still had to travel and whether disasters still awaited them, you must listen to what is told in the next chapter.”	1
As an American of Chinese descent, I was able to read one of China's most famous novels. Although, it is the translated version, I believe that the author translated it very well. This is my first time reading the Monkey King despite having seen several television adaptions. According to my Chinese professor, this book is very true to the original version. Three reasons why I would purchase this: 1. One of China's Most famous novels 2. Abridged Version (if you are pressed with time) 3. True to the original version.	1
Translation is always an incredibly difficult task and this one is between not just different languages and different eras, but also different cultures and different philosophies. This is a very readable translation of a portion of the epic, at the cost of context and a degree of accuracy. However, if you want to just read the story and enjoy it as a story, this is probably the best version. Deeper retellings are a slog to get through and unless you really want every drop, you're better off with a version you'll complete.	1
The original name of this story is Journey to the West.  It is the Chinese equivalent of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  Like Snow White or other beloved Western fairy tales, every Chinese child knows this epic story of the Monkey King and his companions' journey to the West to seek enlightenment.  Along the way, these voyagers encounter demons, fairies and other fantastic characters. I had heard this story many times when I was little and I am still enchanted by the story now that I am a parent.  I highly recommend this book for both parents and children.  Each chapter is a complete story so it's a great bedtime read.	1
I've always been a fan of epics - homer, virgil, beowulf, sir gawain, gilgamesh. This is by far the best of them. It's hilarious, and fantastical in a way that most stories/books of this kind are simply not. I believe it when people say this is one of the best translations out there, though it's the only one I've read.	1
Have really enjoyed this version of this story!  I had no problem understanding the author;  although it could be I was brought up surrounded by the British accent.  My only problem was that parts of it seemed fainter, with a fuzzy static, and I turned up the volume it would inevitably go back to normal.	1
For the most part I enjoyed the story. There were times where parts of the story seemed to be glanced over and other less detailed parts seemed to be dragged out longer than needed. Granted this is an abridged translation, so it could be something lost in translation or just missing from the abridged version.	1
This novel - and it is much more than that - is considered by the majority of people in the world (Asian) - one of, if not the absolute greatest writing of all time.  Shakespear but with more fun, meaning and breadth of meaning and effect - to each - and through each stage of life. It is originally written in 4 good sized books and has been translated to English as well (as other languages) many times.  In many things translated, it is hard to reflect the flow and cadence of things, as well as reflect the sometimes culturally derived understandings and appreciations of things, and so much more.  Especially true with this where not only are there magnificent stories, a poetry and social commentary (and more) in one. This abridged version notes it tries to capture only the major and translatable stories in this absolutely magnificent piece of literature, while maintaining as literal translation of the words as possible.  Great writings, dreams if you will, are great almost in spite of dialect not just because of them.  This is an example of that. The selections and presentation succeeds in all regards and you are swept into the writing and can feel and be washed away in joy and thought by it.  It is entirely comfortable for we US type readers.  (So great is what you get that it even makes me jealous of those who have the ability  to enjoy it exactly as it was written - as many have said for generations - it can be life alteringly powerful). This is a very approachable read for anyone with a US/anglo perspective - and as recommended to me - the best one from that point of view.	1
This book is fun. The book itself was used, and came exactly as advertised, with no tears or bad markings. I would definitely used this seller again. As for the book itself, the story is fun, intriguing, and timeless. I would highly recommend.	1
This is a stunning translation of an inherently beautiful story of adventure and spirituality. The selection of stories is careful and coherent, while the language is readable and entertaining. It’s amazing how Waley captured so many of the jokes and digs in here. Kindle version worked fine.	1
This is a classic fairy tail. It is China's equivalent of the Brother's Grimm. If you enjoy fairy tales, you should buy this as it is well written and not tedious as other versions are. Aurthur Waley did an excellent job of making the story a joy to read. You can even read this book to your children the same way you would read any fairy tale book to children. It is nicely organized with each chapter as a separate episode or story that allows for a pause between chapters without losing the overall arc of the story. It is entertaining, and has hidden gems of both wisdom and mystical teachings for those who have the eyes to see. In other words, you can learn advanced spiritual alchemy from this book if you are paying attention. Secret lore hidden in a fairy tale! Ironically...it also shows Buddhism's nastier side. Few people know that even the Buddha himself had no problem using force to "convince" others of the superiority of his argument. Or that there is no such thing as mercy and forgiveness in Buddhism. The wheel of Karma...divine punishment... is merciless and inescapable. And refusing to bow down and know your proper place in the hierarchy... is an unpardonable sin. A great read!	1
I bought this book as a gift and the person likes the story very much!! I also read this version several pages and from these several pages, I can tell the translation is superb. I myself have enjoyed this book in the original Chinese edition and have loved it since I first read it. The Monkey is such a beloved trickster hero that everyone knows and adores in China and many countries of Asia. Highly recommend this book for your whole family!!	1
I grew up on "Journey to the West", having read it in various Chinese versions catered for easier reading, children's books, even comic books. This translation captures so much of the same humor and personalities of the characters that it was just as enjoyable as the Chinese version. But a big downside is that it's missing so many of the best adventures of the original story. That means we miss out on many of the Monkey's crazier transformations, the beasts and gods and their magic and weapons, and more of the interpersonal conflicts between the main characters. It was like reading part 1 of a trilogy; I wish he had simply translated more. Nevertheless, if you are new to this story, this is not to be missed--a very good introduction to one of the greatest Chinese stories ever written.	1
Everyone you meet in China is likely to have read this so you'll have something to talk about if you visit. You'll also see references to it in Chinese life and literature. Beyond that, it's an entertaining and insightful read. As exasperating as Monkey is, you should come to love The Great Sage, Equal of Heaven.	1
This is a collection of traditional tales from an early China.  It was tongue-in-cheek even then but allows a view into another culture.  And in the end it is a redemptive tale in a Buddhist tradition.	1
A fun read with fun characters, Monkey and Pigsy being my favorites. Their banter, and Monkey's with pretty much anyone, is priceless.	1
Very good fairy tale, at first I thought it might be just Monkey's story but this is a translation of Journey to the West	1
It's a great translation that keep things moving and carries through the humor of the story.  Unfortunately, the printing is low quality.  Issues such as shown in the photo on many pages.	0
Charming tale in generally, maybe the best version of it, and the Kindle edition is very readable.	1
good	1
The copy that Amazon sent was misbound at the printer: pages 119 through 150 appear twice in succession, while pages 151 through 182 are missing. My copy is the 46th printing of the 7th edition (Grove Press). Unless you can confirm in advance that your copy will be a corrected printing, or you are willing to return the book, I recommend getting the book where you can inspect it first. (Note: I'm required to give the book a star rating in order to post this warning. Please discount this rating as an evaluation of the book's content.)	1
An exciting adventure story fleshed out with religious philosophies and historical references. I've never read the original Chinese version so I can't compare, but this abridged translation is still a standout book.	1
I read this book at least 4 times in my past. It was one my ex- husband"s favorite books. When I read the story it made me feel very happy inside. He lost the book in his many moves. So I purchased it as a Christmas present and he was delighted to receive it.	1
item as described	1
My daughter was assigned this book in her 9th grade Humanities class.  She really enjoyed reading the book and creating her own caricature of what the monkey look like to her.	1
I picked this book up after a friend told me it was a classic in China and I didn't honestly expect to enjoy it much. But the first half of the book had me totally engrossed. The second half I enjoyed less. It seemed written by a different author, is translated less elegantly. Still, I fully recommend it.	1
Came brand new with no rips or bends.	1
First foray into Chinese literature went over very well	1
Really, this book is a fantastic read. well written, moves fast, very entertaining and a joy to read. So glad I have a copy...this is a keeper.	1
My daughter had this book for a reading assignment during thanksgiving break and I had to get a copy for myself plus another one to share. Anyone reading Monkey will identify with the main character at some point, if not throughout, the book. Highly recommended.	1
The book gives an interesting insight into cultir differences	1
Could not put it down.  Going to get the next edition	1
The reason I got this is because I was told these stories as boy. It is just as entertaining now as it was then.	1
Great Quality, Arrived on time. Beautiful stories.	1
Before buying this book I also considered buying "The Journey to the West, by Anthony C. Yu" which offers the complete version of the story in several volumes. "Monkey " was a very captivating book and I highly recommend reading it. It only seems to end too quickly. Now I am a little sorry I did not choose the complete version.	1
Great product	1
As a practicing Buddhist I found it particularly thought provoking and uplifting.  However, in places it could do with some additional editing - shonky translations and just plain errors in spelling and grammar, but not enough to spoil the read.  I do find it a bit presumptuous to be reviewing a classic - it is what it is.	1
I actually enjoyed this book! (had to read it for class)	1
Excellent	1
You can find traces of the eponymous Monkey, or Sun Wukong, in modern-day superheroes and manga protagonists. One of the classical works that has plenty of humor and is just plain fun to read.	1
This is the kind of book I can read over and over and I don't normally read a book more than once.	1
Great version of one of the most sourced stories of all time	1
Great story.	1
The cover is a beauty, but the inner text is a bit faded.	0
I used this to introduce myself to Journey to the West since 100 chapters over several volumes seemed somewhat arduous. I greatly enjoyed this, but still feel as though I missed out on something rich by not reading the full novel.	1
Apparently heaven is very bureaucratic in China, e.g. you can get your passport stamped by the guards if you visit	1
Monkey is the funniest book I ever read.  And the things "Monkey" does are beyond my wildest expectations.  This book is very well read literature  in Asia.  If I am not in the best mood, this book causes me to laugh for days.  Very thought provoking.	1
ok	1
It's a gift for my 15-year-old son.  He liked it, though this is an abridged version, quite a few stories are not in there.	1
This book is excellent.  It's one of my favorites that I keep coming back to reread every couple of years.  I love the part where monkey bets buddha that he can fly to the edge of existance and flies to what appears to be the 4 pillars that hold up the universe.  He then pee's on one of them and returns to mock buddha.  Buddha smiles, tells monkey that he never even left buddha's palm and holds out his hand for monkey to smell. anyways, This is a great book and I recomend everyone read it!	1
One of the best stories of all time.	1
If you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll love the magic. If you're a college student, you'll love the high-spirited freedom and roaming. If you remember the '60s, this book will remind you of a really good double-barrel Orange Sunshine trip, without any of the negatives.	1
One of the greatest books ever written.	1
I liked this book a lot. it was a great metaphor and it was also entertaining to read	1
This is a delightful book, full of side plots and weird characters, strange alliances and stranger heroes, all set in a time and place and culture we Americans know little about.	1
Fantastic read. I guess its a classic for a good reason.	1
Awesome Book...Thank You!	1
A great metaphor for revolutionary minded people. Read this book to the end Great work great jokes Aware of nothi	1
A OK	1
Not a book to read for pleasure but an intellectually challenging and historical cultural book.	1
A Novel: In 1989, China was on the verge of becoming a manufacturing and financial juggernaut. By the year 2026, its economy was in shambles and its government paralyzed. What destroyer has invaded this ancient land?	1
This review is not about the translation, which is great.  This review concerns the story itself.  As religious allegory, it's kind of interesting.  But the story is so boring and predictable.  Monkey always wins his battles and outwits his enemies, blah blah blah.  The plot is so contrived as to be thoroughly boring.  The story of "the journey to the west" was so famed that I was curious and purchased this, expecting to laugh at monkey's antics.  No laughter here, just snoring.  Do not read this for pleasure, you will regret it.  Only buy this book if you have to read it for class.  I hear that Arthur Waley's translation is an abridged version of the Chinese original.  I can only surmise that the original is 10 times as boring.	1
Everyone likes the story! However, the printing and binding of this edition is really horrible - cheap paper, small fond of printing, very bad binding. The ink of most of the pages is very light and fuzzy, and the words are just like photo copies from a very old photo copy machine. I bought one copy of "Monkey, A journey to the West, retold by David Kherdian, 208 pages" and ten copies of this book (Monkey, Folk Novel of China, translated by Arthur Waley, 306 pages), planning to pass to my friends' kids for gifts, the former (208-page one) has much better printing and binding and is good for gifts. But this book (the 306-page one) absolutely cannot be used as gifts since it looks way too cheap like those from one-dollar store, and printing/fond is absolutely not appropriate for young readers to protect their eyes.	0
Prevailing amounts of What? Why did that just happen? I know Asian myths are often told out of order and need to be stitched together and there may be several cases of this would make total sense if you knew the culture of the time yet there are many things that leave me wondering.	1
I received the book within a few days of placing my order. The book was in great condition . Would definitely recommend if you are trying to get this book right away!	1
As expected.	1
There is a sort of give no x attitude in this translation and in other translations which is refreshing. Like the tales tamed by Grimm and sanitized by Disney the Journey to the West has faced similar issues but in this translation wr avoid this for the most part. Murder, intrigue, dragons getting their heads chopped off by dreaming ministers are just a few of the topics faced in this abridged collection. You can definitely see where so much of dragonball and dragonball z looted from this ancient novel a bit clearer in this translation compared to the more 'safe' movies and tv shows made in the West or for the West. Check it out. It is good to know more about where so many stories and themes originates.	1
There are some caveats to this review. All translations fail to some extent, wordplay and jokes are lost, meaningful phrasing is lost. All abridgments will leave out parts that some people love or feel are indispensable. That being said ... The Grove Press edition of Arthur Waley's translation of   has been on my bookshelf since about 1955. It is not the same physical book. The original fell apart after much re-reading. I have let friends borrow the book and have despaired of having it returned. I have read several other translations and none of them satisfy me. Friends who know, have told me that the Waley translation is the only one that retains the wit and flavor of the original. I believe that. The next best translation, oddly, is a translation from Chinese to Czech, then from Czech to English. There are things that some people may find off-putting about Waley's translation. Those who are finicky about such things may think the deliberate attempt to retain the spirit rather than the exact phrasing to be distasteful. Waley's scholarship was excellent and he could have chosen to write it word-for-word, but he did not. His version is similar to Coleman Bark's translations of Rumi such as  , true to the intent, meaning, and flavor rather than a mechanical replacement of words. The criticism that I would have to agree with is simple, there isn't enough of it! I know that an abridged version is the best that we could hope for (and even so, some of the reviewers here have complained of its length) but I sometimes hope that a cache of unpublished chapters will be discovered. Until then, however, the distinctive white, black, and orange cover of the Grove Press edition of the Arthur Waley translation of Wu Ch'eng-en's Monkey will have a place of honor on my bookshelves.	1
In the preface to his translation, Waley tells us that the author of MONKEY lived between 1505 and 1585 A.D.  The protagonist of the tales, Tripitaka was a real person, better known to history as Hsuan Tang, who  lived in the seventh century A.D.  There were contemporary accounts of  Hsuan Tang's pilgrimage.  These accounts, along with a cycle of fantastic  legends that began appearing around the tenth century A.D. and the stage  presentations which began in the thirteenth century provided the source  material for Wu Ch'eng-en's wonderful tales. (This is Waley's  spelling.) The first seven chapters are dedicated to telling Monkey's  story up until the time he became Tripitaka's disciple.  Monkey, mostly  through trickery has become more powerful than most of the gods and has  rebelled against them until he is finally overpowered and imprisoned in a  block of stone.  He is freed in order to become the first of the three  disciples. In chapters eight through twelve we are introduced to Hsuan  Tsang (Tripitaka) and learn about the origins of his pilgrimage to India.  The balance of the one hundred chapters are dedicated to the pilgrimage  itself. Early in the pilgrimage, Tripitaka acquires two additional  disciples, Pigsy and Sandy.  Each of the three disciples has been placed in  Tripitaka's path by the gods, and each has unique magical powers.  Without  these powers, and the support and encouragement of these sometimes  reluctant disciples, the pilgrimage would never have been completed, as  there are no end of dangers, evil-doers, and monsters to overcome, and  because Tripitaka is a rather weak and timid pilgrim who needs constant  encouragement. The pilgrimage does end successfully and Tripitaka and  each of his disciples are rewarded in heaven as follows: Tripitaka  becomes the "Buddha of Special Merit." Monkey becomes the  "Buddha Victorious in Strife." Pigsy becomes "Cleanser of  the Altar." and Sandy becomes the "Golden Bodied  Arhat." As is befitting for a book about a spiritual, though  physically challenging, adventure the author ends by dedicating these  hundred chapters to "the glory of Buddha's pure land." We are  told that these tales are for the entertainment of children and adults  alike.  While I agree that this is true of the content of the tales, it is  my opinion that reading this translation would be difficult for young  children. There are translations available that are written in more child  friendly language.  For any reader of mythology, MONKEY should be a welcome  addition to your reading list.	1
This is the full audio version of Arthur Waley's book "Monkey", itself an abridgement of "Journey to the West". Enjoy one of the pillars of Chinese culture, the story that permeates the fabric of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese film, literature, and manga, from "Monkey Monkey" to Dragonball, as rendered by a brilliant Sinologist, while stuck in your car. Kenneth Williams, the voice actor, wasn't ever given a Wade-Giles pronunciation chart, and so butchers Xuanzang's name, but luckily Waley renders it as "Tripitaka" for most of the novel, which Williams can't get wrong. Williams has a thick Received Pronunciation accent (that's the Queen's English for you non-Brits) which many will find hilarious, and which some will find unbearable. The story itself is quite funny in many places, even if it does drag (and if you think Waley's abridgement is long, wait till you see Anthony Yu's four volume complete English translation). It was written down some 400 years ago, and was a popular and widespread folk tale for at least 400 years before then, so don't expect the pacing of a 21st century novel. Monkey masters Daoist magic and after making a name for himself on earth, gets invited to Heaven, where they can keep an eye on him. He makes a mess of things there, then flees back to earth, and fights off the Heavenly Court's greatest warriors trying to take him back for punishment. After another stint in Heaven, he runs amok and, crime of crimes, eats the Jade Emperor's favorite peaches. Oh boy. For wreaking havoc in Heaven, the Buddha himself finally throws Monkey down to earth, puts a mountain on top of him, and tells him to think about what he's done. Five hundred years later, the Buddha takes pity on the barbarians living in China and directs Guanyin, the goddess of mercy, to order a holy man from China to travel to India to get authentic Buddhist scriptures. She picks Xuanzang of course. The merciful goddess offers Monkey absolution and enlightenment if he lays aside his vile Daosit magicks, takes up the one true path of Buddhism, and serves Xuanzang on his journey to the west. Monkey has "help" from a pleasure-seeking pig, a quiet water spirit, and a dragon prince who transforms into a horse, all of whom are to be Xuanzang's disciples. Let's just say that priests will do what priests will do, and between naughty shenanigans, mighty battles, and a coup d'etat, the scriptures are fetched from India and conveyed back to China, this time by a magic cloud, before the whole party is taken back to Buddha's Shangri-la to live forever, rescued from the wheel of karma and reincarnation. (Also available as an MP3 CD:  . This review is from my review there.)	1
Unlike most people, I didn't come to this book through the TV series - I have heard of it, but I've never seen it (although I do intend to try to find it now...). This translation covers only sections of the Monkey/Journey to the West saga, but what there is of it conveys well the flavour of the tale without outstaying its welcome. The plot, such as it is, revolves around the priest Tripitaka and his disciples (including Monkey), who have been charged to journey to the West and return with Buddhist scriptures for the enlightenment of China. The story can, at times, be distinctly difficult to get your head around; superficially at least, it's little more than a succession of episodes involving bizarre monsters being defeated with elaborate magical powers. There is, however, plenty of humour - generally farcical in nature, although occasionally quite dry - and the bickering of the main characters is frequently entertaining. The bureaucratic nature of heaven, in which spirits and deities are assigned strictly hierarchical posts - with salaries! - is amusing regardless of how much you know of Chinese history and society. However, many of the Buddhist and Taoist elements may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the basic concepts. Some of the episodes rely quite heavily on outcomes grounded in, say, the workings of karma or the achievement of enlightenment - although most do conclude with Monkey and friends beating up the monsters in question, frequently with the spiritual aid of Kuan-yin and other divinities. But I do suspect that there are allusions and layers I'm missing... To paraphrase the end-of-chapter refrain, if you want to know whether Monkey and his companions succeed on their quest, you'll have to read the book!	1
Waley's abridged translation of the popular Chinese classic Journey to the West is an approachable version for the initiate but I strongly recommend W. J. F. Jenner's excellent full and unabridged translation, also available from Amazon. Waley's abridged version concentrates mainly on the beginnings of the pilgrimage (e.g. Monkey's origins, his bid to overthrow Heaven, his subsequent imprisonment, his rescue by the holy pilgrim from Tang, and the conversion of the other disciples) and only a couple of the adventures along the road to Buddha's Western Paradise. Jenner's translation, spread over four volumes, covers all these and much more - a total of 81 adventures and misadventures spread over 100 chapters. If you like Waley's translation, go on and get Jenner's fuller version. Monkey is China's version of the universal trickster-hero. Jenner captures all of Wu Cheng En's sly humour, and you cannot help but laugh out loud when you read his translation.	1
The book itself is pretty good. I don't know if the translation is accurate or not, but it was an enjoyable listen, except for one little thing. The person (Kenneth Williams) reading the book had a pretty thick accent. He also is very expressive with his reading. It took a while to get used to the reading of the book.	1
I was expecting a mildly amusing but somewhat slow-going novel when I picked up Monkey for my class in Chinese Literature. But I could not put it down and finished the whole of it in two sittings! This book is as much of  a page turner as any modern novel, using everything from cunning plot turns  to end-of-chapter guises ("And if you don't know what became of them,  you must listen to what is told in the next chapter.") to absolutely  hilarious anecdotes. (I laughed aloud at the "Taoist Holy Water"  episode!) An amazingly well-crafted novel with a very very fluid  translation that makes it an absolute delight to read. Again: I could not  put this book down! The fight scenes were also spectacular...[still  panting, having just finished the book]...you must read this book! =)	1
The story of a monkey, with a priest In this book, nothing as it seems. On the road from China, to Gondaro Will they make it, Nobody knows. This book titled 'Monkey' is the same Monkey many of us know (And most definetly should love) from the television series also called 'Monkey'.  They were both taken from writings penned by Wu Ch'eng-en, who lived between 1505 - 1580.  This translation is absolute joy to read. It is the story of a noble Chinese priest on a journey to find the scriptures of India for his God, Buddhu.  On his travels he encounters three part-men part-animal part-naughty-and-therefore-punished creatures who journey with him in his misadventures, in return for going to heaven. It combines in its reading beauty with absurdity, profundity with nonsense, Folk-lore, allegory, religion, history, satire, and poetry.  You will never read anything like this ever again in your life.  SO GO AND BUY IT NOW!!	1
A blurb from The Nation describes the book as a "combination of picaresque novel, fairly tale, fabliau, Mickey Mouse, Davy Crocket, and Pilgrim's Progress."  I would add to that list The Divine Comedy, The Odyssey, Huckleberry Finn, 1001 Arabian Nights and modern political satire.  But despite the seemingly esoteric description, it is a light, breezy novel.  The reader doesn't need to know who Lao Tzu is to laugh when he pinches Monkey and tells him "Be off with you, be off with you, and don't let me find you hanging round here [heaven] anymore."  The reader doesn't need to have a few University years of Chinese fiction or philosophy under the belt before laughing at Monkey stuffing himself with the Jade Emperor's peaches.  Nor, even, does the reader need to be steeped in morality, for, though having early attained immortality and, we all know, on fast track for Buddhahood, Monkey still likes to crack a dragon joke before clobbering one over the head with his cudgel in "a real garlic-pounding blow that will finish him off for good and all." Waley's translation flows lightly, using a vernacular that is simple, easy and inviting, and, at the same time, reminiscent of the sagacity of the veteran Boddhisatvas, many of whom make guest appearances.  It is a beautiful, wild, fun story centered around a stone-born ape, aka Monkey, aka "Aware of Vacuity," who tromps the world over in search of mischief, power, peaches, sacred texts and enlightenment.  Strikingly similar to 1001 Arabian Nights in both form, wisdom, and content. "I wonder whether a knowledge of the True Scriptures would not cause some improvement in them?  Do you yourself possess those scriptures?'" asked the Bodhisattvas!  `Yes, three baskets of them,' said Buddha," and the journey begins...	1
When reading Journey to the West or Monkey one would be so engrossed by the tantalizing action, the fairy-tale like settings, and animated characters that one would forget that there are many layers to this book. It is a fairytale as well as a satire and a historical fiction based on the true events of Tan San Zang (Tripitaka in the book). With the outline of Tan San Zang's pilgrimage to India to fetch Buddhist scriptures during the arts and cultural Bronze Age of China, the Tang Dynasty, Journey to the West expands his perilous journey over the Gobi desert, Kyrgyzstan, and other Silk Road routes to India in an ingenious way. As a satire, Monkey unleashes the imagination against the cultural backdrop of China. It plays on the three major religions and ways of thinking of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism and blatantly and playfully laughs at them. Like a good joke, one who pokes fun at oneself- it is not hard to see why Monkey has become a favorite Chinese classic touching every mind, young and old. Other than being a satire, like most fables and fairytales, Journey to the West has imbedded moral values that can be found. The characters are fictionalized, except for Tripitaka, and are governed with checks-and-balances. Tripitaka is not too far-fetched from the original Tan San Zang conducting the same pilgrimage, yet he is portrayed as a feeble monk who often "cries like a woman" but his tenderness can move his disciples. Monkey or Sun Wu Kong is witty and the most powerful of Tripitaka's disciples, yet his downfall is his arrogance. Pigsy, another disciple is slow but he is none-the-less loyal and brave. Sandy, also one of the three disciples is mostly along for the ride but he represents sincerity. Even though a big part of their journey is out of this world, taking place in the heavens, the underworld, or under-the-sea worlds, their lively characters embodying their flaws and assets can be related to by anyone who tried to get along with another person. Lastly, the translation of the book by the famous Arthur Waley preserves the comical essence of the book. Furthermore, the most important sequences of Journey to the West can be found and enjoyed in his translation of Monkey.	1
Monkey, also known as The Monkey King or The Journey to the West, is one of the four great novels of China--along with The Water Margins, Dream of the Red Mansion, and The Three Kingdoms.  It tells the story, in allegorical form, of Xuan Zang (or Hsuan Tsang), a 7th Century monk who trekked from China to India in search of Buddhist texts, his translations of which were a key to the growth of Buddhism in China.  His real-life travelogue is itself considered to be a great work of literature, but for purposes of the novel he, referred to here as Tripitaka, is given a group of comic companions : the Monkey King, a kind of trickster god, who represents rebelliousness against both heavenly and earthly order;  Pigsy, a marshal of heaven turned into his animal namesake for attacking a fairy maiden, who represents a sort of earthy stolidity; and Sandy, a kind of sea monster, who Waley says represents "whole-heartedness", whatever that means. The book is intermittently amusing, but even in this abridged version is way too long.  Characters' motivations and the meanings of most of the action are awfully obscure.  And like any picaresque, it is almost purely episode driven, without the various episodes necessarily adding up to a coherent and sustained story.  The book is interesting as a cultural relic, but, if no one told you, you wouldn't imagine it to be such an influential text. GRADE : C	1
are mine exactly. When I read this book for my Chinese literature class this semester I couldn't put it down. Though it is abridged from 100 to 30  chapters, most of what is removed is not as interesting. The best part  about Arthur Waley's translation of "Journey to the West" (he  renamed it "Monkey") is that he is one of the first to play up  the very hilarious humor in the book, though there is of course a quite  serious religious undertone to the whole thing. This is an amazingly funny  story from the Ming Dynasty, which will not disappoint any fan of fantasy,  peculiar humor or spiritual quests. A true classic of Asian literature.	1
My copy of "Childhood in Contemporary Cultures" (edited by Margaret Mead, published 1955) warns that the Waley translation "includes only thirty out of the one hundred chapters of the original text, and many of the most significant episodes have been omitted." A glance through these reviews and I don't see that anyone has caught the fact that this translation contains barely 1/3 of the original Chinese book. Admittedly it's the only game in town, but this is still significant information.	1
I first recieved this book as a ninth birthday present from an adult friend who lived in Thailand, and upon reading its first 13 chapters the book quickly became my favourite fairy tale. Monkey's absurd arrogance is funny, but, by the same token, his optimism and self-assurance is infectious. He thinks nothing of travelling from heaven to hell and all points in between (Solving problems along the way by banging a few heads together) or of achieving immortality by stealing peaches. The story of how he got his great weapon (A staff used to hammer the Milky Way flat) by essentially being the worst guest in history to a much put-upon sea dragon, is hillarious. The book, suprisingly for one written 500 years ago in a distant land, contains some of the best-timed slapstick comedy I've ever come across. There is even one moment of true toilet humour that will have you reaching for oxygen, it's so funny. The pace kept up brilliantly; the final scene of the books first act, in which the forces of Heaven attempt to trap the Monkey King, has the air of a Keystone Kops episode by way of JRR Tolkein. However, there are also moments of touching and disturbing drama, as Monkey's personality gradually shifts from mischievious to almost evil, until he is imprisoned beneath a vast mountain and begins the long road to his redemption and eventual enlightement. I haven't even talked about the main plot of this wonderful story, but it is better if you discover it for yourself. Enjoy!	1
What a wonderful translation of this classic text. Fans of Chineses mythology and the classic Japanese cult TV show will be enthralled by this text. The book appeals to all ages and mental capacities much like an episode of the Simpsons also does. There are many moral messages portrayed and lots of classically funny moments. Read with intense focus of the adventures of the holy fool Tripitaka, the over confident Monkey, the glutful Pigsy and the philosophical Sandy as they travel to India for the scriptures to save mankind. Enjoy!	1
Translation is a bit old and silly but it has its charms. Worth a read to see if you want to invest in the much longer version.	1
I have always enjoyed epics.  My current read is The Epic of Gilgamesh (the completion of which is frequently interrupted by returns to the masterpiece you are reading about).  Previous to reading Monkey, Dante's Divine comedy ranked highest on my list.  My interest in the anime and manga story Dragonball (and subsequently, Dragonball Z) turned me onto the Story of Monkey and The Journey to the West. Comedy is the word I would use to describe Monkey, moreso than Dante's work.  The central character's rise to glory is so colorful and intricate, one cannot help but laugh.  The introduction of Kwan-Yin brings a serious aspect to the tale and a more admirable goal, but the focus on Monkey keeps the nature of the journey in check.  Despite the absurdity of the characters Monkey and Pigsy in particular (though not them alone), the story maintains a very epic feel. This version (up until Kwan-Yin's introduction) deals very little with all the Buddhist dogma that permeates the story.  Even afterward, Monkey's mission is at the forefront.  The author has done a fine job making the tale accessible to everyone (being a white, American, Christian with appreciation for Buddhism and Taoism) and has cut much non-essential dialouge. One thing I had to get used to was the structure of the text.  Paragraph breaks are not always used and oftentimes, conversations are not broken up in the traditional "..." he said "..." she said" format.  Oftentimes, many quotes are strung together before you know who is saying what.  The style takes a little getting used to, but this book still gets 5 stars.  BUY THIS BOOK!  You will not regret it.	1
Monkey's (audiobook) audio is hard to listen to. The transition to digital did not work. Kenneth Williams does a great job narrating, and there's a nifty "echo" effect that adds to the story, but... but... the audio quality makes it very hard to listen to on modern devices.	1
I'm reading this entertaining book for the sixth time.  I met it over thirty years ago in a college class, and now my own students read it in Literature of the Non-Western World. Enjoy some music that somehow fits the book: Alan Hovhaness's Mountains and Rivers Without End.	1
One of the best books I've read in all my life. The characters have been  borrowed and turned into many different characters in film and animation,  but to read the original makes all the imitations pale in comparison. Minus  a few chapters, Mr. Waley has achieved the unthinkable: the best western  translation of one of China's best kept secrets. A stone monkey, brought to  life by the powers of heaven and earth and how he was never satisfied until  he got everything he wanted, by any means neccesary. Top notch!	1
This inspired me to go out and apply for college and start my own journey. The part i found to be the most engaging is the story of sun wukong aka the monkey king, i enjoyed how hard he tried to become equal to the gods and eventually he does. For being such an old tale it still holds up in modern times.	1
Born from an egg on a mountain top - chak-a-chah Monkey is funky and never stops, He knew every magic trick under the sun, He teased the gods and everyone and had some fun Oiii, you lazy lot ! Go out and buy this book do you see, it's very good! I am the great sage equal of heaven !! You will read about lots of demons and adventures , yeeess. And that Holy fool Tripitaka. I am disrespectful to demons, can you see that I am serious !?!	1
Heads up: There are several different translations and abridgements of this story, one of the great classics of Chinese literature. Make sure and choose a version that is right for you. The stories are neat but a little repetative. I would definately recommend an abridged version. Still, the adventures are interesting and give an insight into Chinese culture and mythology.	1
Monkey is the most deliteful journey to enlightenment.  I am it's biggest fan.  I highly encourage anyone and everyone to read it regardless of age or education.  It will teach you most everything you will ever need to know.	1
My friend likes it. It is good way to learn Eastern Culture.	1
An easy read written in a simplstic fashion yet remains enthralling.  The religious factor in the book is strong how ever not over whelming. A whitty satire on the beauracracy of the chinese.	1
Rich, robust, fascinating.	1
It worked well enough for my paper.	1
a fine translation with surprisingly few footnotes, but the sheer length and readability make it worth the while	1
I only rate Monkey 1 star because I could not get into it. So my review is only based on trying to read a few pages. I suppose I was hoping for something like the Judge Dee stories by Robert van Gulik, which have their own lovely, simple style. Maybe someday I can get over the energy barrier and give it another try. But if you're a Judge Dee fan, don't be sure you can get yourself into this story.	0
boring book	0
Wow. As a massive fan of the original 'Monkey' TV show which aired in England in the 80's, I had always been interested in reading the even more original book by Wu Ch'en En. This is an excellent level book which you'd never guess is as old as around 500 years. Beautifully translated into English, but a level of English that is easily accessible to just about anyone. It's a beautiful read and very inspiring if you are travelling somewhere but also inspiring even if you're not. Sometimes the chapters are short and sometimes they're long but either way they are never boring. It's carefully written and beautifully thought out and I would recommend it to anyone seeking an inspiring read. It's also not too hard to get through. Took me about 3 days to finish it and I loved every moment.	1
This is an enjoyable story, but so many things seem 'overviewed' in this abridged translation that it leaves me wishing to read the full translated version (which I know is available, but thought I'd try this version first). Whole periods of the story can pass in as little as a paragraph (or several years pass without mention), and there is no clear timeline. Also, the Chinese translation in to English seems wrong in some parts - either by phonetical spelling oddities, or interpretation of meanings taken literally, instead of understanding a saying or pun. But overall, not bad. I'd say this is a good general overview of a story, but if you want to indulge in to this story, it would be better to seek a full translation - which I plan to do, someday.	1
Arthur Waley's translation of Wu Ch'eng-en's 'Monkey' is lively, humorous and captures wonderfully vibrant characterisations of a myriad host of characters, chief among them being the eponymous Sage. The storytelling is paced with perfect precision - each chapter feels just long enough, with a tantalising closing line leading into the next... It was unexpectedly delightful, and I found myself laughing from page one onward. For pop culture enthusiasts, the influences of this tale on Masashi Kishimoto's manga 'Naruto' are evident. I am now curious to read more of Arthur Waley's translations, particularly 'The Tale of Genji'.	1
Truly a wonderful book with humour (albeit rather simplistic) and magic through out. At times the tale itself can ramble, but the hijinks of Monkey, Sandy, Pigsy and Tripitaka keep you hooked. There were a few chapters that to me were nothing more than filler, and could have been cut. Overall though if you have an interest in Asian fiction and light hearted romps through distant kingdoms this is for you!	1
A must read for anyone interested in reading Chinese classics. I can see this book being made into a movie one day if it hasn't already. What an intelligent man for the 15th century. Long live his brilliant read. I hope more people discover this hidden gem. I don't want to say more than that it is very easy to read and at times you feel that you're in Monkey's life.	1
I read this after having read the excellent San Guo Yan Yi (The Three Kingdoms/Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which I would highly recommend) and, having known a bit about Chinese culture, language and literature I went into it knowing what to expect and was delighted that it had surpassed my expectations. Most often referred to as Xi You Ji or, Journey to the West, it is difficult to appreciate why the author chose to call it "Monkey". While the character of Monkey does occupy much of the first part of the book and remains the strongest and, I'm guessing, most people's favourite character throughout, he is still only part of the entourage of characters who face the Journey. Still, what's in a title? This book is replete with humour, both obvious and subtle. It would help if you had a certain understanding of Chinese History and culture in your reading of this book to understand the many references contained within. However, even if you don't know a jot about anything to do with China, you will still find this book immensely enjoyable and full of quotable wisdoms. It details first the story of the birth of monkey and his fate and then the birth of "Tripitaka" and then begins the Journey to the West. It might often appear a bit disjointed, leaping around topics. For example, you begin with the story of Monkey, and are then thrown into a (seemingly) completely unrelated topic. But the way Wu Cheng'An has worked all these plots into a coherent story is truly brilliant. Instead of finding it disjointed, I found the the jumps kept the book very exciting. While there are certain parts of the plot which I assume are composed according to the epic style of the time (for example, all the battles take place in rounds, or bouts, and seem to follow a standardised format of engage and retreat/chase), these don't detract anything from the novel to one who is used to epic literature (for example, the battles in the Iliad followed a pattern). In following the path of Tripitaka, Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy you invariably pick your favourite for each has their own individual personalities and stock epithets. Pigsy is fat and glutenous and fights with a rake (!) and perhaps is one of the funniest charicatures in the book. Monkey is a mischief maker, both loveable and naughty with fabulous powers. Sandy... doesn't really do much. Tripitaka is hilarious simply because he is portrayed as the hero of this book but spends most of his time being rescued by his disciples! It truly is riotous. Thus, even if you fail to understand the relationships of the San Jiao (Three teachings of Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism)or the nature of the bureaucracy (the way heaven mimics earth), you will still find this one of the funniest reads of your life. Enjoy! (The other three classics of Chinese literature are The Three Kingdoms, The Story of the Stone/Dream of the Red Chamber and The Outlaws of the Marsh and I highly recommend all of them)	1
The basic premise of this novel, in Chinese pinyin "xiyouji" which literally translates to "Journey to the West", sees a group of four set out on an epic journey to recover the Buddhist sutras from India and bring them to China. On the way they encounter various monsters, ghosts and demons trying to stop them. The four represent different sides of human nature, their journey to the "West" (actually India) mirrors the human journey of life and whilst Heaven is awash with bureaucracy, the Earth is littered with challenges and obstacles. The Monkey King is perhaps the most famous character of all, bold, proud, brave and cunning, equipped with a magical staff, the ability to transform himself into over 70 different shapes and a whole host of magical powers. Tripitaka is the monk, humble, kind and naive, the epitome of the Buddhist devotee, but not averse to reciting a curse that can keep Monkey under control. Pigsy is the third main character, representing greed, sloth and lust, usually to be found eating, sleeping or chatting up the ladies. Sandy is the fourth, but pretty non-descript member of the group. The story is humorous and satirical. It contains a lot of references to Chinese history and elements of Buddhism and Taoism (Daoism) which can be a bit confusing if you have no previous knowledge. Arthur Waley's translation is only a fraction of the original tome however, and those looking for a genuine translation of equal depth to the original should look elsewhere. Think of this as a distillation of some of the best bits. Perhaps you need to live in China to realise just how important this novel is, not just as a piece of historical writing, but also in the Chinese contemporary imagination. If you're interested in China and Chinese cultural mythology, you should definitely put this on your reading list!	1
I watched Monkey as a kid My parents taught me about Buddha and the stories of Monkey and just when I thought I had forgotten it all I stumbled across this book. I love it so much I keep buying copies for friends. The chapters are very short and detailed with detail from all of Sun Wu'Kong's (Monkey King, Great Sage of Heaven) adventures, how did he get to possess the staff? Why does he wear a head band that hurts his head? Did they get the Buddhist scriptures from India? Who was Pigsy and Sandy? It actually goes hand in hand with the old TV show really well funnily but is so beautifully translated. I adore this book and take a copy everywhere I go	1
Good quality binding and cover. This story is vastly underrated. Monkey is a mix of adventure and morality that blends together in an early quest tale that is unlike those found in the West. Although I knew the ending and characters beforehand, I had no idea of the variety of adventures they undertake. Well worth a read.	0
Those of a certain age in the UK will remember the Japanese TV series of a Chinese folk tale, well this is the book where it all began. This is the story of a Monk tasked to collect holy scriptures from the India and bring them back to China. On his travels is his accompanied by Monkey, a mischievous, impatient immortal Monkey King who was punished for causing trouble in Heaven and, after 500 years being stuck under a mountain, agrees to protect the priest to atone. Also travelling with the priest in hope of atonement are Pigsy, cast down from Heaven in to the form of a pig demon and Sandy, also cast down from Heaven into demon form. The English translation leaves a lot of the story out, only 30 chapters versus the original 100, but still manages to tell a good story. However I would recommend buying the physical book. The Kindle copy contains a number of OCR errors, where the publisher has attempted to convert the physical book to an ebook. Even with the latest updated version you will see the odd 2 or £ in place of z, 1 in place of ! etc. It is a shame as with just a little bit of effort this could be fixed.	1
I love the story & added a little more understanding about Chinese culture...........cheers Michael	1
A charming story to read. Monkey is a very likeable and witty character and this text is easy to read in modern English.	1
Bought this because I am a fan of the old TV series. Was pleasantly surprised to find that the humour and silliness were not fabricated by TV producers, but actually exist in the original text. As a translation of a sixteenth century text, you'd probably expect the storytelling to be a little dry, but I now see how it fit so neatly into a TV format. I've read this to my son as a bed-time story, over many nights, and he loved it. It's a real magical story that does not age. Love it.	1
Remembering the great tv show from my childhood, I decided to buy this and was pleasantly surprised to find the book so much better still. Arthur Waley's translation renders it exceedingly accessible to a worldwide audience. A timeless classic.	1
I bought this as it is what the TV series Monkey was based on. It was brilliant from start to finish as the TV show practically copied this ancient story word for word. Crucial reading for any Monkey fans.	1
Highly recommend if interested in oriental literature. Simple and easy to read, very enjoyable. Amusing characters and plots will keep you hooked.	1
interesting, fun, informative	1
Journey To The West, the tale filmed as Monkey, is as iconic to many British schoolchildren (thanks to the dubbed TV version) as the original text is to the Chinese. What's interesting is how closely the TV stuck to the book! One of the great reads. A joy.	1
I do not tire of reading this. I suffer from complex post traumatic stress disorder and this is of great benefit to me personally on some of the darker days . I highly recommend it to anyone.	1
5 stars great page turner. Each adventure gets better each time. Monkey is my favorite character who just keeps evolving.	1
I had heard of this book way back in 1960's  I saw the TV version 'Journey to the West' now reading the book and am almost completed it. Any one interested in myths and legends of China this will teach you a lot I shall read it many times	1
its the only book I have read twice.	1
Very interesting and readable book - recommended,	1
Great read. Great condition	1
I bought this book after running a web search for the TV programme 'Monkey' and thus discovering that the series was based on an ancient Chinese story. This abridged telling of the story is obviously well  translated - the English is very rich and - where some differences in  language could not be literally resolved (like when Chinese wordplay were  rendered irrelevant) there were useful footnotes.  Waley has gone against  the convention for previous translations of the Monkey story; he has  rendered a small section of the saga in its entirety rather than covering  the entire story in a much abridged form. I found the story fairly dense,  it is very stylised and so fans of Chinese history and culture will love  it.  I was surprised by how malevolent the Monkey character was and by how  antagonistic the relationships between him and the other main characters  were. For those fellow fans of the TV programme, roughly half of the book  comprises the story of Monkey before the TV show - i.e. the story of how he  rose from a simple monkey to become an Immortal and a Monkey King.  The  rest of the book describes the quest of Monkey, Sandy, Pigsy and Tripitaka  to retrieve scripture scrolls from the Buddhas of India.  This part of the  book was most like the TV show - a series of sub-quests or episodes with  the team of characters resolving sub-plots (like ridding a village of some  evil ogres who plague and bully them) but I found they became slightly  repetitive and hard to follow (due to the plethora of Dragon-Kings,  heavenly locations and minor deities, and the inconsistent wielding of  magical powers which made me think, "well if you have THAT magic  power, why didn't you employ it in the last chapter when it could have  easily got you out of that tight squeeze?"). The story is full of  allegory and subtle humour and satire - but I suspect it was slightly too  highbrow and subtle and buried in the Chinese imagery and language for me  to appreciate fully.  If you liked the TV series then the familiar names  have some nostalgia value but the book is slightly hard work - and the team  of characters not the jovial tight-knit bunch I remember; indeed there  exists between the main characters throughout the book a sense of mutual  dislike which gave the book, I feel, an uneasy and uncomfortable  atmosphere.	1
Great product loved it!	1
Fascinating tale I just couldn't put down!	1
And excellent translation of this classic.	1
The book is wonderful.	1
A decent presentation of the tales of Monkey and his friends. Great read.	1
Very entertaining read	1
Excellent quality dispatched instantly a wonderful book	1
Excellent. Thank you. Beautiful book.	1
Classic Chinese fictional literature.	1
Monkey magic is awesome	1
Worth reading though heavy going at times.	1
I've not read anything quite like this before. Comic, irreverent, alien, odd, yet easy to read and elegant in a timeless way.	1
A fantastic read, full of adventure, humour and a great taste of Chinese culture!	1
yes	1
A classic from my childhood. Now I can find out how it ends.	1
great beginning but it gets boring as the monk turns out to be such a crying baby	1
Ich bin endlich durch und habe wegen Monkeys Frechheiten gegen Autoritätspersonen mehrmals kurz auflachen oder schmunzeln müssen. Es liest sich wie eine Satire an Heldenlegenden und ich glaube, das ist auch beabsichtigt. Ein wichtigtuerischer, kleiner Affe der sich gleich selbst als König krönt und das große himmlische Reich an der Nase herumführt. Er bestiehlt, beleidigt und verkloppt jeden, der ihm krumm kommt und wo er ein Ziel wittert, ist er mit Eifer bei der Sache es zu erreichen. Monkey ist ein Anti-Held und seine Geschichte bis heute eine der bekanntesten Legenden aus Asien. Wer DragonBall kennt, wird merken, warum der Anime von diesem Buch inspiriert wurde. Das Buch ist in Englisch, aber tatsächlich sehr einfach zu lesen und zu verstehen auch für nicht-Muttersprachler. Ich empfehle trotzdem ein minimum von B2, sonst schlägt man jedes zweite Wort nach.	1
I read this in practically no time at all. If you're nervous about reading the unabridged Journey to the West and just want to see if you can get into Monkey, this is the book for you.	1
Es passiert ständig etwas in dieser Geschichte, denn die namengebende Hauptfigur ist mit gewaltigen magischen Kräften ausgestattet. Ungeheuer und Zauberer werden reihenweise überwältigt und wenn es eng wird, kommt noch eine weibliche Gottheit zur Hilfe. Alle zeigen aber auch humorvoll beschriebene menschliche Züge.  Kein mythologische Tiefsinn aber viel Spaß.	1
this adaptation was a funny wild ride. I love fantasy, folk tales and adventure so this was a good pick and one of the best class readings I ever had. I suggest reading up on classical Chinese philosophies/religions, adds an extra level of amusement, understanding and appreciation for this novel.	1
Me ha costado encontrar esta edición, es la buena.	1
A must read for anyone wanting to get a better grip and insights on the Chinese/Japanese culture. This story has been a source of inspiration to many different other books, mangas and others. Why only 4 stars? With a very interesting beginning, the story loses a little interest after Monkey is imprisoned and becomes a disciple. It becomes slow and feels like there won't be anything new happening.	1
Though the language has been polished for English readers, the humor and the intent of the chapters aren't lost... A great read for inquisitive spiritual readers.	1
Got an older bit damaged  copy, different cover same publisher, seems like an older edition. Papers all old	0
New book. Paperback. In a good condition as expected. A cheaper and better bargain than some other hardcover options.	1
Nice translation	1
An entertaining read. I enjoyed it thoroughly.	1
Great Read!	1
All lovers of the 80s children's TV programme should read this. It is great fun but is sadly spoiled by some of the worst formatting I've ever seen. Come on Penguin Classics. We expect more from you.	1
Bought for my son, he thought it was great!	1
A fine Classic, 10/10.	1
very good translation, glad I received it.	1
got bored halfway because Monkey is basically a little s***	1
At the time I write this, I still haven't read it. Still, this classic novel is in my to read list for quite some time and I have high expectations for it.	1
i started to read this book as it was my book club choice - gave up half way through - but loved the last line of each chapter	1
most unusual don't know what to think	1
These stories were well written and provide an insight into a religion unknown to many.  There were adventures and trials, sorrow and repentance, and a task accomplished.  Reading these stories helps all understand the benefits of a life worth living in a honest and righteous way. Many can benefit from a righteous life!	1
Well written. Well translated. This book is a must! The monkey kings stories show you some insight on everyday battles that we all face. Maybe not in the form of a monkey or demons flying around. But to take a step back and rethink how you would normally do things.	1
Awesome story! An irrepressible monkey character, seeking immortality and defying the very mandate of heaven, defying the gods themselves! A legend of freedom and bravery for the ages!	1
Received as described and quickly but I should have done more research because this is not my cup of tea.	1
Absolutely brand new condition! I am very happy with this purchase!	1
For those who enjoy mythology and fantastic tales this book is for you. Plenty of fights and battles between supernatural warriors. However the story revolves around the Monkey's personal journey, first to gain the knowledge to become powerful and inmortal, then his naughty adventures as an inmortal disrupting heaven, earth and hell and finally to redeem himself by helping Monk Xuanzang from China get the Buddhist sacred scriptures from the remote West (India).  This book is like a Kung Fu flick from the Tang dinasty and it's a delightful first step to study the chinese literary tradition.	1
How fortunate for Hsuan-tsang, the priest traveling to the West to secure authentic Buddhist scriptures from India to carry back to China, that he encountered Monkey, and Pigsy, and Sandy, who helped him and guarded him throughout his arduous journey. Read and enjoy this enchanting and celebrated folk tale from China.	1
splendid insight into the stories that form part of the Asian character today.	1
I have an interest in learning the Chinese culture, and this was recommended to me by a Chinese student who told me that most Chinese students have read this book!	1
Excellent!	1
This dude thanslates funny	1
This is a well known story I have been familiar with since childhood. I evaluate it based on the accuracy against what I already know.	1
I bought this book for a World Lit class, and while it was an okay read, it wasn't my favourite. Still somewhat interesting, though, just not my taste.	1
No illustrations and I returned it.	1
great sink..love it	1
I LOVE SUN WUKONG GREAT STORY!	1
The book is a nice summary of the rise and fall of the monkey king. IT is great for all those, who cannot be bothered reading the big novels. But, I have to admit, I found it very short. There were time when I was wondering, why has this been shortened, and why has this event been excluded altogether? However, for a summary book, this version is very good. I enjoyed the funny side of Wukong very much, the terribleness of the Pig  and the seriousness of the Master. Something that was really great was to read about their loyalty to each other. The translations were really great, but at times there were a few typos. However, the storytelling is great, I read through the book in two days. It made me want to continue reading, to see how each quest ended. I can truly recommend this book to anyone who is somewhat interested in the story of the Xuanzang's journey to the west. It has everything a good book needs, humour, seriousness, action and a deeper meaning. :-)	1
Very good book but the first three hundred pages are very boring but when they meet wan sang it gets like better and also it keeps on repeating the same plot and monkey kills the demons like.	1
Wonderful book and subject matter but I prefer the penguin classic translation.	1
A classic which everyone should read	1
Great condition, very have with my purchase	1
Nice book	1
Yet, as a story, you cover the whole journey and you get to discover all the characters. If you want a first contact with Chinese culture in terms of literature, go for this one. The "full" version is almost 1000 pages bigger. Read both, I prefer this one.	1
Etwas sperrig trotz schon erfolgter Kürzungen der Originalgeschichte. Viele Kampfesschilderungen, die mich persönlich eher langweilen, aber dies ist nunmal ein Teil der Geschichte und der Übersetzer hat sie schon gekürzt. Darüber bleibt die Botschaft, dass wir die einzelnen Protagonisten, allen voran den Affen allegorisch in uns haben und die beschriebenen Kämpfe sinnbildlich in uns selber statt finden, manchmal schwer zu greifen. TRotzdem eine gute Möglichkeit, sich dieser in China jedem Kind bekannten Geschichte anzunähern und sie kennen zu lernen.	1
wonderful book reading	1
Good!	1

Indispensable pour connaître un des contes Chinois les plus populaires à travers la planète! Bien documenté et très intéressant pour bien comprendre le sens.	1

Fantastic	1
Wu Cheng’en’s sixteenth-century novel “Journey to the West” tells the story of the pilgrimage of Buddhist monk Xuanzang to the “Western Regions” of Central Asia and India in order to obtain Buddhist sūtras and return them to China between 626 and 645 CE. Xuanzang wrote his own account in 646, “Great Tang Records on the Western Regions,” which formed the outline of Wu’s novel. The novel is a humorous adventure that satires Chinese bureaucracy while also telling an allegory of enlightenment. Many in the Euro-American world know elements of the story from Arthur Waley’s 1942 abridged translation, “Monkey: A Folk-Tale of China,” while some elements of the story inspired Akira Toriyama’s “Dragon Ball.” Along with Luo Guanzhong’s fourteenth-century novel “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” Shi Nai’an’s fourteenth-century novel “Water Margin,” and Cao Xueqin’s eighteenth-century novel “Dream of the Red Chamber,” this novel is one of the Four Classic Novels of Chinese literature. This edition presents the complete novel in four volumes, translated by William John Francis Jenner, a noted sinologist who completed this translation while working for Foreign Languages Press between 1963-1965. It features Qing Dynasty illustrations to supplement the text.	1
This book is a classic, and doesn't really need much explanation. With that said, there was a particular choice made in translation that I found immensely irritating - U.S. Standard units were used, and just substituted in for Chinese units. Li became miles, span became foot, so on and so forth. The other Chinese Classics don't do this, and it was disappointing to see here. There were also some odd translations within the descriptions, such as describing instances where monsters were pounded into pulp as "like hamburger". These are minor flaws, but they still grate.	1
An excellent translation, complete. Very complete. The full tale is very long, so most editions are abridged. It is not easy reading for westerners, it's an ancient Daoist Chinese tale with absolutely no quarter given to modern western minds. However, it is definitely worth the effort. This is not considered a classic for nothing. For those not familiar with the story, it is a mythological recounting of the adventures of an actual Chinese monk who travelled to India through countless perils. Probably the closest in Anglo-Saxon tradition is Beowulf, which recounts Scandanavian history in the same way. Journey to the West isn't simply high adventure, though. Each of the adventures explores specific issues and the Chinese Daoist interpretation. It is thus intended as educational. As a guide to thoughts strange and alien to western minds, it is second to none. Teaching stories exist in many ancient cultures, but none are as comprehensive.	1
My daughter was thrilled with book collection and has been avidly reading it since we got it for her at the start of the summer break. I haven't read it myself, but I will relate that it speaks to her 13-year old sensibilities and she has been enjoying them. Perhaps at some point I will have the time to read the set and see what the fuss is about. ~ Kort	1
This is a four volume translation of the great Chinese epic. It is published by the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing. I suspect this a government organization. I do not read Chinese, so I cannot say anything about the translation. But I like this version. It is poetic and appears to be complete--it is over 2500 pages long. This is a pure translation, each of the four volumes has about three notes at the end. There are other translations that explain everything. Those explanations are not essential to enjoying the story. I recommend this version if you just want to read a great story.	1
First of all, this is one of the four greatest classics of China, which already merits your attention. To be more specific - this is an epic full of the most diverse adventures, in the style of the glorious Ancient-Greek  Iliad, Odyssey and the Tasks of Hercules. However, strangely enough, this can also be a written description of a computer game, full of battles against ferocious dragons, monsters and corrupted leaders - religious or civil - passing from level to level, till the happy end. The heroes also carry all kinds of special weapons and possess supernatural powers - belonging to a culture that has probably inspired also those very computer games. These heroes' purpose is double - fighting against evil creatures, and refining their own selves in order to reach heavenly immortality. They are three,- symbolizing the three parts of each body. The witty Monkey represents the intelligent resourceful brain. The pious monk Sanzang is the compassionate heart, and Pig - the village-fool - is the greedy stomach, providing the many humorous episodes. In short - never a dull moment. By the way, the Monkey also becomes a monk, and the unintentional pun Monkey-monk provides us with hilarious instants... The first chapters describe how Monkey was born from the primordial union between Heaven and Earth from a stone-egg, and how he defied the heavenly rulers, wrecking havoc in their lofty palaces, ruining their peach-feast, stealing the pills of immortality, winning by ruse a wondrous weapon, subduing ferocious dragons as well as many troops of heavenly soldiers, being cooked in a furnace just to win all-seeing golden pupils, erasing his name from the records of the underworld, thus making himself immortal - and more such brave and indeed incredible feats - only to be subdued, finally, by the great Buddha himself. His only way to release himself from his eternal imprisonment is - to help the pious monk Sanzang, whose life-story is most touching, make the 36,000-miles-journey to the west to fetch the scriptures for the impious easterners. On the way they're surprised by seemingly impossible tasks, such as crossing huge seas or lofty ridges, and in addition they meet all kinds of unimaginable powerful fiends, which they must fight according to the different circumstances. Each battle is described in a short free poem, just as the breathtaking views of the mountains, brooks, rivers, storms, flowers and birds are described lyrically. Each of the many adventures - about 60, at least - is self-contained, and so, even if the reading stretches over several months - nothing's lost. The reading is easy and pleasant, and mostly - encouraging - since each battle symbolizes our own daily hardships, and so each victory is ours too!!.. Since the book concentrates mostly on the versatile ever-lasting fight between Good and Evil, with very little romance, for example, it could be read by any child, just like fairy-stories. And so, whoever is looking for a present for a youngster, even 10 years old, or whoever is willing to teach a computer-addicted boy or a teenager to dedicate some time to simple reading - this is the book for the task!! Plus, whoever is willing to enjoy a long journey from China to India, with everything it has to offer - sceneries, people, trades, spirituality, vices, different habits of many countries - at least twelve are mentioned - and also visit many levels of heaven and even the underworld on the way - and get out of it intact - all this without leaving the comfortable home and even bed - especially during long cold nights - just step out and invest in buying this book - it's simply indispensable!!!  A personal confession - I happened to be born in the Year of the Monkey according to the Chinese astrology, and on the day of the Monkey according to the Mexican astrology - so I'm a double Monkey, and I'd detested it!!! Till I've completed the reading of this book. Now I can be proud of myself, just for having such a representative in one of the most fascinating specimens of the world literature - the most charming Monkey you'll ever meet!!! :-)	1
I am so happy I bought this edition of the series! It arrived on time in great condition. I have been wanting to read this book and am very happy with this particular translation. It is written is a poetic yet easily understandable way. The 4 books are bound in a nice cover. A couple previous customers commented about the thinness of the paper. For me this was a good thing. I was concerned that 4 600-page books were not going to fit on the shelf, but due to how thin the books are made I do not have this problem! This is a delightful read and a great edition! Highly recommended.	1
I bought this some time ago and finally got around to reading it.  The language is great if flowery, but part way through I discovered several blank pages.  The one sent to me is the 11th printing of 2011.  I bought it over a year ago so don't think there's any return policy.  If anyone buys this, check it upon receipt for blank pages.  Mine start at page 314 of volume one.  I can follow the story across the blank pages, but it is annoying.  But other than that I love the language used in this translation.	0
The set is great, except when I got to Volume 4, i found it was the wrong book!  The sleeve was correct, but the book was Strange Tales from the LiaoZhai Studio IV not Journey to the West IV.  I would like to replace this even though it is past the return date	1
5 stars for the translation.  4 stars for the physical book quality. Since other people have expounded on the plot, here is a review based on the physical book. The actual paperback novels are approximately 7" x 4.25," so easy to hold in your hand and tuck into a briefcase.  The pages are a bit thin, not "Bible" thin, but they are a bit thinner than most paperback books.  One of my volumes didn't hold up well to sitting in a steam-filled bathroom. There are occasional pictures and sparse endnotes, but they do not detract from the story at all.  The pictures were drawn during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and are done in the old chinese style, not some new-fangled doodles. Some of the translation is a bit iffy, and sentences do not necessarily always make sense, but you'll understand it contextually.  Some of the wording is extremely quaint, such as Pig complaining that the demons failed to drink "acuppa" with them.  There is much more painfully British vernacular, but it just adds to the goofy charm of this book.  Don't bother wringing your hands over the never-ending list of characters.  Skim over them and read on.  After all, there are an awful lot of demons and gods to meet on the journey, and quite a few of them are fated to die via Monkey's cudgel, making their characters irrelevant in the long-run.  One thing I noticed is that there is an awful lot of scatological farce for a book written in the Ming dynasty (don't worry, it's still hilarious). I've read a couple translations of Monkey King, and while they'll all stay in my personal library, this is the one I anticipate picking up again and again.  I loved this book as a child and ten years later, I still do.  A must-read for fans of mythology or Chinese literature in general.	1
This is an excellent translation of the entire JTTW.  Sure, the paper is paper-thin and cheap, but if you hold it up to the light you can read both sides at once, saving time.  Stop whining- for short money you are getting almost 2400 pages of the finest mythology, religion, spirituality, allegory, folktale, humor, and monkey butt-kicking awesomeness.  My favorite book in the world, bar none (and I can only read it in translation, alas!).  It might not be for everyone, but I've already read this book twice and it was sublime.	1
The book is very good , it's a fun novel (for 500 year old novel) ... Also keep in mind that this are 4 books, each one of about 500 pages ... The book quality is what you would expect for the price , not terrible, but definitely not prime material ... I would recommend get this if you wanna read the novel and that's it .. if you want a book you can keep and collect , probably go for a expensive one ... Me... I liked this one just fine	1
It's a great collection to have whether you're familiar with the story or not.  However, the written style is a little hard to read and the translation of names is a bit too literal that its almost comical and confusing.  Nonetheless, It's a great set to own.	1
This is the most complete and faithful translation of Journey to the West I have yet found. It is the third version of the story I've read, and unlike those other versions ("Adventures of Monkey King"/ISBN 0962076511 and "Monkey : A Journey to the West [ABRIDGED]"/ISBN 1570625816), it contains the complete and unabridged story, preserving very faitflly both the style and content of the original story. This extreme faithfulness is both a strength and a weakness. It's a strength in that you get a real feeling for the scope of the original work, and you get to hear all the interesting little back-stories and side-stories that make Journey to the West one of the great works of Chinese literaure. It's a weakness because these stories often seem completely irrelevant, and may be quite confusing to someone who is not familiar with Chinese culture and religion. For example, every time something happens in Heaven, Hell or in the palace of the Tang Emperor, the book includes a complete list of everyone who attended. In Heaven, at least, many of the names are descriptive (names of stars, constellations, etc.) and are therefore translated. In the Tang Emperor's palace, though, you'll get a list of 10 or 20 names in Chinese, and only some of the names ever get stories attached to them in the book (and I challenge any non-Chinese speaker to remember the names when they do show up again). There's also a lot of poetry, and though the translations are good, translated poetry can never equal the original. In one sequence, a fisherman and a woodsman argue in verse for 10 or more pages of very small type, frequently singing songs set to tunes few non-Chinese would recognize by name. These characters are important only in that the end of their conversation sets up a conflict, so the only purpose of the sequence is to provide a chance to read the poetry. It's good poetry, to be sure, but it really can drag a bit. You can't just automatically skip over all the poems, as you might do with Tolkien, either. Elements of the story are often told in verse. You can usually skim if you're not interested in a particular bit of verse, but don't skip it entirely. The structure of the work is also surprisingly complex at times, especially given its age. It will at times veer far from the main thrust of the story to recount the entire life history of a character, and has many side stories that somehow tie back into the main plot several chapters later. You may at times find yourself wondering just why the author chose to include a particular bit of story, but there's almost always a payoff waiting somewhere down the line. Another problem is that the style of the storytelling is not very concise. If someone in the story needs to recount what has happened to them, you'll get a second, (fortunately much abridged) version of an earlier portion of the story, written as dialog, this time. You could make similar sorts of complaints about many of the early great works of English fiction, or probably just about any other country's older fiction, so this is not really a strong criticism given the work's great age, but I often found myself wishing the author (or the translator) had just written, "he told them what had happened" and left it at that. There were also many quirks of the translation that bothered me. The word "memorial" was used throughout instead of "memorandum". It took me quite a while to figure out that was what was going on. I read all of the abridged translation that also made the same mistake throughout, but still didn't figure it out until I was several chapters into this one. Will all these complaints, you're probably wondering why I gave the book 4 stars. The fact is, for all its faults and quirks, "Journey to the West" is still one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. The Monkey King is without a doubt my favorite character in any work I have ever read or watched. The story of his journey is a brilliant parable on the jouney to enlightenment, while at the same time a story of great humor and exciting action. It also provides fascinating insight into the history and traditional culture of China. If you want to get the whole story and can't read Chinese, this edition is your absolute best bet. (Indeed, it's pretty much your only bet.) Some of the other translations may be a faster read, but none are as satisfying.	1
When I was younger, I saw first on TV and then later at a Kiddies Mattinee a movie "Alakazam, the Great".  If fascinated me, and as I studied more and more mythology, I realized that it must have come from a mythic source, and I tried to find that source for over 30 years.  Last Spring I found out it was part of this book by watching a made for TV movies, called "The Monkey King".  Here was the story I had been searching to find in this movie named and that is when I began to look for this book. True this book has pages that are so thin that they are like tissue, but they have beautiful illustrations and in these illustrations are the characters of Alakazam, though he is only known as Monkey here in this Chinese Buddhist tale of pilgamage, and the adventures along the way. I am used to Western Mythology, Classical, Norse, and Celtic so this was a journey that had new meaning for me.  And like the characters of this journey, it is a journey into a new and as yet source of spirituality that has much influence in the world.	1
I've been a long time reading this 2300-page classic Chinese "novel."  The quotes are there because, if you read it as a novel, you'll grow tired of the repetitive elements in the large body of the story.  Think of it more as a comprehensive compendium of folklore tales centering around the central character, Monkey.  The seed of the story was the actual journey of a Tang dynasty Buddhist priest from China to India and back.  This journey caught the Chinese imagination and somehow became embellished with the mythical Monkey, who ultimately became much more interesting than the priest himself.  Many stories grew around a formula of Monkey protecting the priest from monsters along the journey.  The author, Wu Cheng'en, organized many of these stories into a single narrative, which apparently became the authoritative record of all the Monkey folklore. This unabridged translation by W. J. F. Jenner includes a "Translator's Afterword," which I recommend you read before (not after) you read the story itself.  It helps you to understand why there are so many incidents that do little to develop the story or the characters.  This edition was prepared for and printed by the Foreign Language Press of Beijing, so do not expect it to meet American standards of proofreading. If you are chiefly interested in enjoying the story itself, read Arthur Waley's abridged translation, "Monkey."  He keeps all the essential elements so that you learn the plot and get to know the characters, but cuts out most of the formulaic "Monkey vs. monster" stories, so it is paced more like a modern novel.	1
I bought the paperback edition several years ago. I loved the myths and read the material several times. Unfortunately, the paperbacks are poorly printed and not bound well enough for multiple readings. I just received the hardbacks and make the following observations: 1) left-hand pages are printed in Chinese while right-hand pages are printed in English, 2) pictures are on single pages with the facing pages blank, 3) binding seems to be very well done - strong as well as supple, and 4) there is a bookmark ribbon attached to the binding side of each volume. In summary, this looks like a quality edition. The hardback is printed in 6 volumes while the paperback (English only) is done in 3. I assume that the translation in the hardback is the same as in the paperback version. That was done very well and I'm looking froward to rereading the adventure with quality paper in my hands; that's one of the real luxuries in life! I have, above, made several assumptions based on my prior experience with the paperback. If these assumptions prove wrong, I will update this review and my rating. This is in addition to my original review: I am now reading Volume 4 of 6. There is a horrible error in that volume. There are many missing pages from Volume 4; in their place are many pages from Volume 2. I am knocking two stars off the rating because of this. The vendor said he will send me a proper Volume 4 in October when his stock is replenished. I, fortunately, can finish reading the story because I have the paperback version from the same translator. If I receive a valid copy of Volume 4, I will re-rate upwards and assume there was just a bad run. I also note at this time that there are many little typos: wrong one of to, two, too; many one-letter substitutions; etc. I am of the opinion that the final edit of a translation should always be made by a native speaker of the "to" language. I'm guessing that this opinion was not respected here. The errors in the paperback version, if memory serves me correctly are different. This is a second update to my review: I have just received a corrected copy of Vol. 4 from the seller. Thus, I assume that good copies of this book set are available. I would caution you to check with your seller of choice that the hard copy set you order is one that does not contain the mistakes that were in my original order. At this point I'm changing my product rating back to 5 stars.	1
This set exceeded my expectations. The text is clear and easy to read, there are more illustrations than I expected, the bindings are strong and the four books fit in their sleeve comfortably.	1
If you want to test the waters before jumping into the deep end, may I suggest that you first watch the Sci-Fi Channel mini-series "The Lost Empire" (2001), originally aired under the title "The Monkey King". While far from a faithful adaptation, it is a very good introduction to the main characters and overall concept(the character of Sanzang aka Tripitaka being replaced by an American scholar of Chinese literature.) This is an incredibly lengthy story for anyone not prepared for what is inside. The basis for one of Asia's most beloved children's characters (Monkey), the tale is written as a series of short stories seemingly crafted with children as the target audience. Fashioned similar to western children's adventures ("1001 Arabian Nights" comes to mind), each snippet of the journey comes with lots of action and shallow motivation - often falling to greed, hunger, hubris, revenge or a simple thirst for adventure. I feel certain that these stories were kept easily accessible by many parents through the years as a means of entertaining their children. While the characters are far from anyone's idea of the heroic stereotype, their flaws also help to endear them. I don't want to give the impression that I am critical of this work or that I would discourage anyone from reading it, only that this may not be the right choice for your first foray into Chinese literature. Many adults in Asia will unashamedly admit to having read the full volumes (I once spent a couple of hours discussing favorite stories and swapping character impersonations with the CEO of a large company in China during a business dinner) but western readers will likely find it disjointed and often hard to follow. Though rarely pivotal to the story and generally addressed in the generous notes, the author has a great propensity for injecting phrases and concepts that the casual reader will simply not be familiar with. I often found myself running to Google in the middle of a paragraph. There is also the tendency for characters to be referred to by multiple names or titles (Monkey has more than seven) with no easy way to keep them straight. All things considered, I tend to view "Journey to the West" less as entertainment than as one small facet of the cultural legacy of China.	1
wrapped a lot and some books damaged while shipped but got them on sale so no compliants going to give it 5* for it was just about what i thought would come out of a book on sale, on a side note no pages damaged not a worry of mine but something worth being added to the review	1
Best adventure stories ever.	1
Can't say enough about how much I love Sun Wukong. He has got to be the greatest mentor of them all.	1
Rarely do I come across books that captivate me.  They are so rare, in fact, I remember their titles well.  Carlos Castenda's books, for example, and his stories about don Juan.  Journey to the West falls into this category.  Each time I resume reading it, I catch myself with a smile on my face; yes, I am enjoying the story.  And I hate to put it down when life calls me to duty.  I already know I am going to hate it when I come to the last sentence of the last volume in this set.  Perhaps fate will spare me and I will die before I reach the last sentence of the last volume; at least, I can say I died happy!  Now, it may be true that other translations of this story are better, and I am starting to mull over that notion; still, I, for one, willl not tell you this particular translation is bad; no, no, no, that will never be my pronouncement.  I encourage any doubters who may be thinking about it:  yes, buy the set and enjoy it.  You will not be sorry.	1
Journey to the West is indeed a great epic, and the prose is actually quite good. Its concise and easy to follow. I'm not sure about how accurate the translation is (I can't read Mandarin). However, the one thing that really makes me angry, is the numerous silly spelling errors throughout the book. Its as if no one bothered to edit it (there are one or two errors per chapter). There is even a spelling error in the summary at the back of the book (they used 'isa' instead of 'is a'). The paper and print quality is below average. The book is damaged and creased easily. Although the story is great and the translation is good, the book is presented in a haphazard manner.	1
This was advertised as the entire set (all four volumes) but I only received volume 3 in the mail. Falsely advertised.	0
I liked the stories in this book. It is an adventure from a log time ago that takes place in Asia. A movie was made of the series, but there is a lot to this and the movie really only had one of the many adventures in it. My son liked it as well.	1
Our family wants to learn about Chinese legends. Great books!	1
Quick ship, good packaging, wonderful 4 volumes of the Journey.The softbacks were overly tightened in being bound so that it is difficult to read the last word or two-but  its part of the journey so enjoy.	1
I know nothing of Chinese history much less Buddhism, but I thoughly enjoyed this series. Knowing something of the Monkey King (the mind) and a bit of background about this book helped me to enjoy even more when I was taken on an adventure ride I will not soon forget. This has got to be the longest comic book ever written - it is that entertaining. Do not buy the abridged versions of the Monkey King as you will not get the full effect of what I beleive was intended, which is to discribe life's sacrifice and rewards.	1
Exactly what I wanted. Box set in amazing package and great price! Perfect gift	1
I purchased this for my son for his birthday and I haven't seen his face since without one of the volumes in front of it.  He absolutely loves it.  I tried, unsuccessfully to find this set at other booksellers and as always when I need something, Amazon came through.  Thank you for excellent service and availability.  I look forward to many more purchases in the future.	1
The only thing I didn't like is the font printed is too small.	1
Package arrived earlier (very) than forecasted. Everything fine, according with promised. Very satisfied.	1
I was extremely satisfied. All of the books are in like new condition and have not been used any if at all...5 stars!	1
awesome, this was for my daughter, very good condition, came right on time, very nice collection,she is very happy with this item, will buy again , nice experience, everything was great.	1
This is volume 1 of 4 only. Not whole set.	1
One of the great Chinese Classics. Don't miss it. You'll love Monkey!	1
Now you can read it in English translation.  This is a classic novel and one of the five best written novels	1
I have read the series at least three times.  Very fun.  Very addictive series.  This series gives you a very fun look into ancient Chinese culture and mind-set.	1
The novel is obviously great. But this exact translation is a little outdated. You would have a much better read with the newer Alex Yu translations. Also you lose a few stars for labeling this product as "a novel in 4 volumes" and not "volume 4 of 4". Nowhere on the order page did it make it clear and obvious I was buying jut the 4th volume. I really thought I had god a great deal on the complete texts, until the package arrived and it was just one book. Try harder guys.	0
While there are definitely some interesting stories interspersed throughout, the major takeaway I had from this book was how LONG and BORING the adventure was. Once the main characters are established, they have encounter after encounter with trouble which inevitably goes as follows: 1) Monster sees Tang priest 2) Monster kidnaps Tang priest 3) Monkey saves the day It is in fact so formulaic that after having finished just the first (out of four!) book, there is nothing truly surprising anymore. I get that the whole journey is supposed to be epic and that the true length of their adventure must be shown, but just because the Priest and his disciples are tired from the journey doesn't mean we have to be! Yes there is character development and exciting battles along the way, but do you need 2500+ pages for it? Absolutely Not! For all those looking to get into the story I strongly suggest a more condensed version.	0
If you are interested in Buddhism, you will enjoy this book.  It helps to already know something about the religion.  As a bonus, the box has a nifty color picture of the Tang monk, and the book covers have nice color pictures of Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand. The adventures are a bit repetitious, but a hoot--Monkey is the ultimate fearless deal-maker, ready to fight on his own or call in favors to get the job done.	1
(Editorial Note: I realize it sounds incredibly pretentious to speak on the translation, given that I can't read the original Chinese. As a disclaimer, let me say that the most important aspects of translation for me are interest and readability. I couldn't care less about the "accuracy", or "tone of the original work," etc.). Perhaps I want something different from a translation than most. While many scholars want the reader to see the flavor of the Chinese original, I want the work to stand on its own in my language. I don't want to have to learn Chinese in order to appreciate the work. With these thoughts in mind, I am disappointed in Jenner's translation of "Journey to the West". I am no scholar. While I have read a few works here and there, the reading was solely for my amusement. To be sure, some of the works of ancient Chinese literature have truly moved me (I have read "Three Kingdoms" four times, straight through, and have perused it uncountably often). I challenge any reader to find a better adventure tale than Shapiro's retelling of "Outlaws of the Marsh", and "The Scholars" has an immediacy even in today's world. However, while the saga of the Monkey King can be at times engaging, I often lose focus sifting through the religious imagery and boring poetry (yes, I suppose it is very good, but most of these poems sound the same, so that in the end, every poetic retelling of a battle or a landscape might as well be the first). I think that the elements of a TREMENDOUS story are present (indeed, Monkey is a household name among Asian children, even today), but few children or adults can suffer through the tedium of passages such as "Most benevelont and merciful Boddhisattva" or "Enlightened Teacher of the Way and Most Compassionate Buddha" over and over. Call me sacreligious, but this is too much. I wish that Jenner's work more resembled Shapiro's, where poetry is often translated as prose or deleted altogether, so as NOT to give away the plot of an entire chapter. Five stars to the work, one to the translation for an average of three altogether.	1
I have yet to actually sit down and read these books but I wanted to review the quality of the item. The box tore easily, The pages are super thin to point you can see through them, there was glue on the binding and covers of all 4 books that was easily scratched off with my nail, and the pages of one book were cut wrong; a section was too short and the top of them were connected and had to be torn apart. Not worth the money from quality alone. Reading some other reviews I learned the translation is in accurate or sloppy.	1
This item I purchased for my oldest son. I taught him to like books so whenever possible I get him books.  This is the type of book he is in to these days.  Gathering knowledge in the way of reading books these days is such a joy that I strongly suggest this item to anyone that loves books as much as my son and I do.	1
This rating has strictly to do with the thin paper used to create the book and not the actual content of the book.  I had issues with the very thin paper the book was printed on.  So thin that the opposite side of the page 'bled through' to the page I was reading and made it appear blurry, which gave me a near instant headache, so I was unable to proceed.  I really wanted to read this book based on a friend's recommendation, and all the positive reviews it got here, but the blurriness made it impossible .  Will try again from a different publisher.	0
The book was good but I thought that the spirit and demon stories are too much the same over and over.  Especially when the author translate the  phrase "the two fought for so many rounds and neither seem to emerge to a victory." every time Monkey King fights the demons.  Believe me, it gets old. And Tang priest is made out to be so wimpy, crying all of the times he's caught by the demons.  I know he's supposed to be a mortal man, but, common!  crying like a baby whenever he's caught? Another thing, why hasn't the Tang priest trust Monkey King's judgement on knowing when they meet spirits and demons?  They have been traveling together for like ten years or so. I had to skip a lot because got tired of reading the same type of monsters capturing them and what Monkey King has to go thru to save them.	1
awsome!!! perfect for a gift	1
This is the second complete English translation of "A Journey to the West", the first being Yu's.  Jenner's version makes compelling reading and I found it very difficult to put the book down.  The translation is sprightly and idiomatic and the extensive passages in verse are attractively rendered. The only demerits are the lack of footnotes to explain some of the references to individuals and doctrines (for which one needs Yu's version) and the relatively poor standard of printing and typography: better proof-reading would have helped!  However, I cannot say that these shortcomings impaired my enjoyment of these volumes and I would strongly recommend them to anyone in search of a readable version of this engrossing epic.	1
poor translating , the story is great but poor choice of wording make it difficult to read.	0
There are, at present, two complete versions of the long Chinese comic novel "Journey to the West".  One of them, the more recent, is published by Anthony Yu at Chicago University Press.  The other, an older version made by W. J. F. Brenner for the Foreign Language Press, is made over five decades ago, but is as yet still not completely superseded. Looking through the translations, it's obvious that both are worthy undertakings by two enthusiatic contemporary Sinologists.  Anthony Yu, though not a native English speaker, is professor of East Asian studies at the Chicago University, an expert in his field, and an ethnic Chinese.  Brenner is a long-time Sino translator who has rendered his fair share of Chinese classics into English.  So how did these two translations fare compared with each other? Brenner is a no-nonsensical and very sensible translator of the Wu Cheng'en's book.  While he doesn't take great liberties with the text, when required, he demonstrates lots of felicities in reframing Chinese ideas and philosophies into English. Take the beginning for instance, a difficult passage which involves understanding of Chinese arithmetics and metaphysics.  Here is Brenner's version: "In the arithmetic of the universe, 129,600 years make one cycle. Each cycle can be divided into twelve phases: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII. VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, the twelve branches. Each phase lasts 10,800 years. "Now within a single day, the positive begins at the time I; at II the cock crows; at III it is not quite light; at IV the sun rises; V is after breakfast; and at VI one does business. VII is when the sun reaches noon; at VIII it is slipping towards the west; IX is late afternoon; the sun sets at X; XI is dusk; and at XII people settle down for the night." This is elegant as is readable and comprehensible to an English audience.  Although Brenner forgoes the nitty-gritties of exact transliteration, he did not excise anything of note, and got the gist of the passage right.  One could imagine this is how the author would have composed in English. Brenner's translation is consistently fine and accurate.  His language is on the whole simple and easily understood as long you have a high school degree.  Where Brenner is more limited, as compared to Arthur Waley's classic abridged "Monkey", is in recreating the full range of tones and satiric emotions of the original.  "Journey to the West" is a satirical, high-spirited adventure story; Brenner is idiomatic and readable, but he can occasionally sacrifice some of the original's comic mischievousness.  Here Waley is incomparable; though he may sound a little arch, one has no doubt Waley is at one with Wu Cheng'en's spirit.  Brenner, on the other hand, can at times sound a little too matter-of-factly.  There are moments where you will chuckle in delight reading Waley, but might not do so with Brenner. Now to Anthony Yu's version.  Made in the 1980s, it, too, is a highly commendable piece of work.  The first thing one notices about it is its extreme faithfulness to the text - even more so than Brenner's.  At times, it even strikes one as being slavish.  One must praise his version for being so strictly straightforward, though at times this literalmindedness makes some word choices incomprehensible to English readers.  Take his constant rendition of "Wood Mother" for instance, a term which has no meaning whatsoever in English, or "eating rice" for "taking a meal".  This is a version especially good if you know your Chinese and would like a crib to read the original with.  While maybe not as idiomatic as Brenner, Yu is even more academic and scholarly in that he attempts to translate every character of the language.  Faithfulness to the letter of the text takes foremost priority, sometimes over readibility. The success rate is varying, but the translation is on the whole an admirable one. Comparing the two, both Yu and Brenner can be recommended.  Yu would be first choice if fidelity to the text is your priority.  If you prefer your English to be more idiomatic and the story to flow better, Brenner should be considered.  The two run pretty close and neither is yards ahead of the other.  But Waley's translation is still a marvellous read, and even if it is highly abridged, it should under no circumstances be forgotten.	1
Nice story. Very entertaining. Full of important allegory. For example, if you find yourself in the company of a pig, a monkey, and a horse, do you really think you can stay out of trouble? Or will the pig, the horse, and the monkey redeem themselves by saving your bacon? And can you really get where you are going without them? Or should you choose a different destination and leave the pig, the monkey, and the horse where you found them? You can see that it gets really interesting. We all go through life with this barnyard coterie of associates, and what we think of them and how well we collaborate is of the utmost importance, so that is what I am thinking as I reflect on this very interesting, not to mention fun, book.	1
I finally finished Journey to the West the other day. At over 3,000 pages across four volumes, it's quite a journey in and of itself. I will examine plot, characters and polish before assigning a grade.  This is a review of the novel as a whole. I might do something more specific at a later date.  PLOT  The novel itself is basically two stories. First is the Rise and Fall of the Monkey King and the second is Xuanzang's journey to fetch scriptures from Thunder Monastery.  The Rise and Fall of Monkey is like a Protagonists Journey to Villain. It starts off with Stone Monkey becoming the Handsome Monkey King and going on adventures to protect his kingdom from threats, up to and including death-by-old-age. Then he gets so full of himself he attacks gods and rebels against heaven. In the end this villain is defeated.  The plot is quick, fast paced and constantly escalates. The method by which Monkey becomes so powerful makes sense. The series of events that lead to him trapped under Five Elements Mountain is driven by character decisions. It can stand alone as a complete story. Naturally, Monkey fans want to see him get out from under that rock but it can stand alone.  The rest of the novel is Xuanzang's journey to fetch scriptures. It has an interesting start. There's this Dante's Inferno thing as part of the set up and there's also how Xuanzang gets involved in the quest and then how he recruits his three disciples. Then it's basically filler until they reach Thunder Monastery.  The Pilgrims encounter demons that want to eat/seduce Xuanzang and Monkey has to rescue him. Usually, he has to seek help from other deities instead of simply smashing everything in his path. There's occasional variations, like helping a kingdom from an unrelated demon scheme, problems with humans, or a Broken Bridge.  I like the ending. It's a good ending, with closure and such.  CHARACTERS  Because there is No Antagonist, the only developed main characters here are the pilgrims themselves.  Xuanzang is basically a walking plot device because he takes no action other than starting the journey and placing the headband on Monkey's head. Monkey could jump back and forth between Thunder Monastery and Tang capital twenty times with ease but Xuanzang is mortal and cannot ride on clouds so he has to go the long and hard way. He gets captured to involve the Pilgrims in the affairs of demons along the way and insists on helping everyone (even if they're a demon in disguise), thus providing the excuse to delay the Journey.  If the other three characters in your cast are criminal demons, then it's necessary to have somebody like this but he could stand to be more like a true Good Shepherd and less like a jerkass.  Monkey is like a Trope Maker or something for general shonen anime heroes: he's rude, arrogant, and defeats enemies by beating them senseless with his superior martial arts but he is also driven by a kind heart that wants to protect his subjects. In addition, he is an old and cunning trickster. Many of his victories rely on sneaking around gathering Intel and then devising a strategy to overcome his opponent's advantages. He also knows more about Buddhist teachings than his own master, who was raised a Buddhist monk.  Pig is basically a sidekick type character. He makes wisecracks, helps the hero in small ways, and gets captured occasionally.  There isn't much to say about Friar Sand (or the dragon prince/horse for that matter).  POLISH  When you're translating over 3,000 pages of Chinese into English, there's bound to be some typos. I only found a couple, which is admirable on the part of the translator.  Trickster Eric Novels gives Journey to the West a B+	1
For any translated work, reader should own 2 for parallel reading, and this one is a direct translation. The author uses split-character method to create 4 main characters: Master, Monkey, Pig and Sandy. that actually one person that holds all these character on a struggling road for good. Master fears, Monkey dares, Pig lusts, Sandy dumb, of course each one holds more related natures not to mention, I hate many critics state that Sandy is not fully developed, that's exactly such person, that we may find him at our work place and in government office too. And another things, a reader may find out that those road blocks, demons and monsters are actually closely related to many gods, sages, and even Buddhas' their family, servants, or weaponary or item which their belongings that cause all the troubles for the 4 and the common people on earth. True, Wu Kong wants to be great, he is great; San Zang wants to get all wisdom scroll for his nation (people), even the gods support them, but who are truly blocking them to do so? This is not only satire to religion and government, it reaches deeper and much farther than To the West. It is a journey or reflection that author carries us to experience and each reflection after beating away a demon, and at last even Buddha calls a storm to sink some of their scrolls. Just look around company, society, government, or even religious institute, or any institute, as long as one who recognizes himself in it and strives for good, then he may obtain the experience and nature of the 4 main characters, and he would also discover all the gods and demons: jade emperor, Guan Yi, White Bone Fairy.... Welcome the Journey to the West, it's better than Disney world, coz this mythical world is 100% real :-)	1
Journey to the West is probably the most well-known tale amongst Chinese folk the world over.  It is a story that has been adapted in the form of operas, television series, cartoons and movies many times over.  To be able to read a complete and unabridged version of this epic is a joy indeed.  My only regret is that as a Western-educated Chinese, I am not able to read this masterpiece in it's original language.  Although the translator does a very good job at translating the book, I am sure many nuances and subtleties of the Chinese language have been lost in the translation. The story is a simple one.  Set during the early Tang dynasty (the peak of Chinese civilisation), a holy Buddhist monk has to travel from China to India to collect the true Mahayana Buddhist scriptures from the Lord Buddha himself, in order to bring enlightenment to his fellow country men.  The journey is a long and ardous one, not least because numerous demons lie waiting in ambush for a chance to capture and eat the monk, as his holy body will confer immortality on whoever eats it.  Thus, the Goddess of Compassion assembles a strange group of bodyguards for the monk: the proud and mischievous Monkey, the lustful and greedy Pig, the loyal and steadfast Friar Sand, and a Dragon Prince transformed into a horse.  Their various adventures are so full of humor and wacky hijinks that I cannot help myself from laughing out from time to time.  Monkey is the ultimate Chinese version of the universal trickster-hero.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this book.  You will not regret it for a moment.	1
I should point out that I am just a product of the American public education system who only knows english. I read this in my free time and knew little to to nothing of Chinese history. Somethings, I feel, are definately lost in translation here. I understand that much of the Poetry is layed out in beautiful rhymes and even set to music in Mandarin or whatever dialect came first but to read these parts translated quite so literaly into english is as painful as it is reduntant. I tried to skip some of it but once in a while, there is one tiny detail that you have to catch in the poetry explanations that are integral to the overal story of a given chapter. In that respect, we pay a culture penalty for reading this in english, no matter how skillfully this book was translated. The origion chapters for the main characters where a thrill ride and every bit worth the cost of the book. After you have established the characters and their origion stories and they set off on their, well.. "Journey to the West", some of the monster stories start to follow simular patterns. The middle to end parts of this book may have made for an entertaining tv series. Every chapter there was always some kind of monster trying to eat the Tang Priest guy that Monkey and company where escourting. If it wasn't scary monster animal/demon spirits trying to eat the Monk to gain immortality, it was some female monster/animal/demon spirit trying to have sex with the Tang priest to gain immortality because he was an 8th generation reincarnated virgin saint or something. These stories are intermitten with other chapters that had to do with them taking a detour or having to deal with someone from Monkey's past or some monsters trying to mess with our hero's for whatever reason. There are alot of crossover cameos from other numerous Chinese and Indian storys and mythologies. To that end, it has sort of a Shrek 2 vibe to it. This book is an epic, every bit as worthy, if not more so, than the likes of the Illiad or The Lord of the Rings. This also reads like a comic book that hasn't been fully illistrated yet. Nobody tell Frank Miller. The battle scenes go on for several pages at times. If thats your thing, there you go. If you don't mind skimming through a dab of gibberish here or there to get to a great story, this book is for you. Fair warning, you may not get through it in one sitting, It did run over 2000 pages.	1
This is a great Chinese classic!  I think that the translation is not too bad (given its history), and it would be fun to read aloud.  I like how the books are divided, and the illustrations from the Qing dynasty are also fascinating.  As for the content, I think it is probably widely known among people who study Chinese culture.  The most lovable character is obviously Monkey, who will stop at nothing to protect his feeble Buddhist master the Tang priest Sanzang.  Zhu the pig is also interesting as an incessantly loathsome character who specializes in overeating and over-indulging in just about everything.  The only character I think could have been more developed was Friar Sand.. :(.  The most predictable one was Quan Yin who always ends up saving Monkey for the first two books.  Some great moments were: the manfruit, the false Western Heaven, and of course Monkey's bad behavior in the first 20 chapters of the book.  Its a great read for any age.	1
I've always loved books, particularly the kind that create a new and different world and draw you into it. It seems I was pretty serious about my fantasy reading, as evidenced by an inscription to my children in the back of The Fellowship of The Ring, mass market paperback edition circa 1977. I wrote the inscription with a ball-point pen when I was 10. My daughter showed it to me when she was 14 or so. It said something to the effect that I love this book so much that my only wish is to pass it on to my kids so that they can feel what I did when I first read it. Apparently I did, and apparently they did. I still feel that way about The Lord of The Rings, but I read Journey To The West a couple of years ago, and it made me feel the same way except magnified. I was 37 when I first read it. It was like Tolkien, plus all the L. Frank Baum Oz books plus the Arabian Nights, all the Greek myths, Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams all rolled into one. This book is over 2300 pages, so it took some discipline to get through. But as you go, you savor each moment, each line. When I turned the final page, I was seriously tempted to start again at the beginning. Seriously, it's that good. It is that good, despite being very far out of context for most people like me. What I mean is, I'm about as Western as you can get, or at least my parents intended me to be so. My understanding is that Chinese kids absorb the Monkey King story by osmosis, they drink it like mother's milk from they day they are born .... kind of like Big Bird or Elmo in the west. But that's not at all a fair comparison. Big Bird and Elmo fall in the category of pop culture. This same category is fair game for any number of PhD theses in any number of fields of learning. Do you reckon anyone will know who Elmo is 500 years from now? Neither do I. But we still know Monkey today, and I bet we will still know him 500 years from now, if there is anyone around to know anything. It is possible that Journey to the West is the most widely read or known text in the history of humanity. That's a bizarre thought to those of us brought up in the isolated shelter of Judeo-Christian mythology. I'm sure it is less analyzed than the Christian bible, but then it doesn't exactly beg for analysis: it's obviously a very long fable, indicating very little in the way of how to live one's life, whether or not to eat bacon with tea on a Tuesday morning, or anything else relevant to modern life. It's not about textbook ethics, nor is it about everyday morality. It's not about how to please God or your fellow man (woman if you are one, to quote Colin Hay). It's about fantasy. It's about delight in the sheer variety of the world around. If I were a book, I would want to be about that. All that is left is for me to suggest that you read Monkey King. It's a project, and you need to get in the right frame of mind. You're going to need some fortitude to read it all, but it's worth it. It really is worth it. What follows is my somewhat lame attempt to summarize a book which probably shouldn't be summarized. Please ignore it, I wrote it in a fit of passion 2 years ago. Sun Wukong is the Handsome Monkey King, Great Sage Equaling Heaven. This book is about Sun Wukong, the Monkey. The novel is composed of 100 chapters, each told as a story such as an oral storyteller might relate. Each chapter ends with a sort of cliffhanger and a directive to read on if you want to know what happens next. In chapter 1 Monkey is born (hatched ?!) and asserts himself as a force to be reckoned with. He's fairly happy eating exotic fruits and being king of the mountain but eventually the idea of death occurs to him, and he gets quite naturally upset. One of his monkey friends suggests to him that there are 3 kinds of beings who are free from the cycle of death and rebirth: Buddhas, Immortals, and Sages. The Immortals are enlightened ones of the Taoist faith, and Sages refers to Confucianism. The Handsome Monkey King decides to set out on a journey to gain immortality. Eventually (after about 10 years have passed) he runs into a Taoist Immortal who imparts the secrets of everlasting life and great travel powers to him. Having acquired great cosmic powers, Monkey proceeds to use them. He causes no end of distress to the kings of Hell in Chapter 3, and soon comes to the attention of Heaven (i.e. the Powers That Be). Heaven attempts to placate Monkey's insatiable lust for power and recognition with a fake job and title. Monkey can be fooled, but only for so long, and in the end he causes chaos in Heaven (which is a bad thing). The Jade Emperor of Heaven calls out all the armies of demons, heavenly generals and warriors, you name it. Time after time they try to take Monkey into custody and fail, until finally the Buddha himself steps in and traps Monkey. Handsome Monkey King is imprisoned under a mountain for some 500 years. By now we're up to chapter 8, in which the Bodhisattva Guanyin sets out on a journey to appoint a pure hearted priest to go west and bring back the scrolls of wisdom from the Buddha's Western Paradise. On the way Guanyin flags a couple of demons to help the priest on his journey. In chapters 9 through 12 we learn about Sanzang, the Tang Priest who is destined to recover the scriptures from the West, a million miles away, or so it seems. Sanzang is a rather weak fellow, a mere mortal with no special powers of any kind. His strength is the pureness of his heart and his faith in his mission. The Journey to the West is Sanzang's voyage to recover the scrolls, and it really begins in chapter 13. He does not have an easy time of it, being almost constantly beset by tigers, monsters and demons, not to mention deep dark forests and formidable mountain ranges. However the Tang Priest quickly gets help, in the form of a dragon transformed into a horse, a flesh eating demon who works as a bodyguard and gopher, and a gluttonous moronic pig-demon who serves nicely as a luggage carrier. But most importantly he acquires Monkey, who is freed from his imprisonment under the mountain on the condition that he helps the Tang Priest and cultivates his behavior, learning to be a good Buddhist monk. Imagine Monkey with a shaved head. Once the cast is assembled, the journey begins in earnest. Monkey, the Idiot (Pig), Sandy and the dragon horse accompany Sanzang through 30000 miles of dangerous terrain, beset by evil spirits and demons at every turn. By this time we're done with chapter 25, 585 pages into the novel, and we've closed the back cover of Volume 1. In the other hand we hold Volume 2, almost drooling with anticipation. Throughout the next 75 chapters, the action is pretty much non-stop. There are lots of bad guys, and Monkey gets lots of chances to show off his incredible magical powers, his sheer brute force, and his amazing mental capacity. His conversations and arguments with The Tang Priest and The Idiot are always amusing and sometimes hilarious. His martial prowess, wielding the As-You-Will Iron Cudgel, is unparalleled. Sometimes even Monkey gets in over his head and has to call in an air strike in the form of Heavenly forces, or various Gods, Constellations, or other muscle. I won't give away the ending, but suffice it to say it's a happy one, after 2317 pages. As to the quality of the translation I have nothing to add. It was more than readable to me: it was a delight, poetry and all. As to the quality of the editing, it's not perfect. On the other hand, the flaws don't detract from the experience at all. As to the quality of the printing: keep in mind that this is published by Foreign Language Press of Beijing. In some ways FLP doesn't live up to American standards of production quality, but in others it excels them. The paper is necessarily thin, but the books are tightly bound. These are not mass-market paperbacks. One does not feel that the books will fall apart on a second reading, and there is very little danger of breaking the spine. Also, Journey to the West is nicely illustrated with Qing Dynasty pictures. The quality of the reproductions is not the highest, but let's not bite the hand that feeds us. My box of Journey to the West was a bit scuffed and dinged and dented. Same with the other titles I have purchased from FLP through Amazon. I imagine this is FLP's fault. I'm not entirely happy about it but for a book this great, I can live with a couple of small physical flaws (especially at this price). I'm just happy I got my grubby little monkey paws on it.	1
JOURNEY TO THE WEST," IS A CELEBRATED CLASSIC WRITTEN ABOUT FIVE CENTURIES AGO BY WU CHENG'EN, AKA MASTER OF SHEYANG, ABOUT THE JOURNEY TO THE WEST TO FETCH THE SUTRA, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT IS a story of every person's purpose in life, to live a righteous life, go on the road he or she must go, until he or she reaches the Western Paradise. This person, represented by a team of the Tang Priest and his four disciples, has personalities like each of them. We may not know it, but we have an ounce of cleverness and bravery and strength in each and every one of us, like Monkey King, and are we not as stupid, lazy, and lascivious as Pig? Like Frair Sand, we can be steadfast to our beliefs, what is right, and can tell what is man and what is demon, what is right and what is wrong? The horse is repentant of his crime and accepted his converted life as a horse, are we  not like that too? The Tang Priest represents everything that is pure and right, but is a gullible person. The demons they met on their way represent different sins and temptations, to fight them is a battle within oneself, fighting for what is right and against what is wrong. At last, when all battles against evil are won, they are pure and righteous and changed over the course of the journey, worthy to meet Buddha, get the Sutras, and become Buddhas themselves. This simple story is lesser known as a religious story, but is still highly recommended by me, because of its exciting plot, great characters,a reflection of Chinese feudalism and society of the time Wu Cheng'en lived, teachings of Buddhism, and knowing a thing or two about Chinese culture, all packaged in one. A true classic!	1
Journey to the West, translated by W J F Jenner, is a little too good a translation. The Chinese love their bureaucracy. Numbers are very important and interesting to them as are titles and position. Translating all the boring bits does not make for a good read, but it does make for an excellent insight into Chinese culture, not on a mythological level (the rest of the novel does a great job of that) but on the day to day level and how government affects their day to day life. To that end, it's a very good translation. A bit boring at times, if you're not one for too much detail that bears little relevance to the plot. Characters are named with grand titles but never appear again, while minor characters will receive fully fleshed out back stories that seem tangential to the original story but soon tie neatly in. A very good set of books. Interesting, boring at times, but as pure as it can be to the source material without learning one of the most difficult languages in the world. Also, this is the story that inspired Monkey Magic and Dragon Ball. If you're fan of either, it's a good read just out of curiosity.	1
Back in the 70's there was a TV show, made in Hong Kong and dubbed into English by the BBC. It was called "Monkey" and the premise was that three spirits had been banished to Earth, to regain entry to Heaven they had to take sacred writings to the West travelling with a priest. Now I loved this programme for several reasons, 1. the stories were wonderful 2. it had great action sequences 3. the acting was hilarious 4. it had a funky seventies disco/cheese soundtrack. So little did I suspect that the story was an ancient tale by Cheng'en Wu - it took a friend from Japan to point it out. Re-living my wasted youth - I ordered instantly from Amazon and have not been disappointed - these stories are wonderful and perfectly mixed my childhood afternoon TV sessions after school with my 30 year old mind and spirituality. I still love Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy - and I suspect you will too!	1
I grew up with these stories and just wanted to read them and put them all together.  It was great to find it and now putting all the stories together is a wonderfull thing.  I have a greater understand of the tail now.	1
I have already read it several times and I think I will read it again some time. It's a fun novel, besides, folklore collections and ancient Chinese fiction, presenting a real world through imaginary stories. You will encounter demons (sometimes, god-like ones), gods (sometimes, common people-like ones) and common people... I don't know about others, but I found myself in this book: sometimes I am the priest, sometimes I am the pig and sometimes I am the monkey... PS: It's one of the so called "4 Chinese ancient classics" (other 3 are A Dream of Red Mansions, Outlaws of the Marsh and Three Kingdoms)	1
It was a gift to someone else	1
Though "Journey to the West" is immeasurably important in the history of fiction, I find it hard to recommend it in its entirety. Sure, the story itself is a classic, but it, for the most part, is also incredibly dull, repetitive, and downright confusing as an actual novel. For instance, the story begins with a longwinded explanation of how the Kalpa system works. Fine, that's pretty interesting. This serves as a transition into the actual story, which begins like so: "There was once a magic stone on the top of this mountain which was thirty'six feet five inches high and twenty'four feet round. It was thirty'six feet five inches high to correspond with the 365 degrees of the heavens, and twenty'four feet round to match the twenty'four divisions of the solar calendar. On top of it were nine apertures and eight holes, for the Nine Palaces and the Eight Trigrams." Okay, we get it. There was a rock on a mountain. Moving on... "There were no trees around it to give shade, but magic fungus and orchids clung to its sides. Ever since Creation began it had been receiving the truth of Heaven, the beauty of Earth, the essence of the Sun and the splendour of the Moon; and as it had been influenced by them for so long it had miraculous powers. It developed a magic womb, which burst open one day to produce a stone egg about the size of a ball. When the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey." Wait, what? How? Back it up a second! Hey! "When the stone monkey had learned to crawl and walk, he bowed to each of the four quarters. As his eyes moved, two beams of golden light shot towards the Pole Star palace." Huh?! Why?! I assumed that the monkey's origin was in line with the mythical creator Pan Gu's, given the similarities, but after page one, it's never acknowledged. We never learn why the rock changes into a monkey of anything in the universe it could've been. And the light thing? No hint of reason is given, it just happens. There are plenty of moments like this. Bizarre, mystical mumbo jumbo that's never explained. I've asked fans and scholars alike about this scene, and to this day, there is no explanation of what the hell it's supposed to mean. Oh, and the poetry... ugh. Every few paragraphs, the story suddenly grinds to a halt so that the narrator can expound an awkwardly translated poem. Usually, these serve to replace the conventional act of conveniently describing something. Usually, this means pointing out every intricate detail of a character's outfit or a plot of land for no real reason. Maybe it sounds wonderful in its original Chinese, but the translations I've read are all cringe-worthy. Here's an example, also from the first few pages. This one describes a feast: "Golden pills and pearl pellets, Bursting red and plump yellow. The golden pills and pearl pellets were winter cherries, beautiful and sweet; The bursting red and plump yellow were ripe plums, tasty and sharp. Fresh, sweet'fleshed longans with thin skins. Fiery lichees with tiny stones in a red sack. Branch after branch of crab'apples, Yellow'skinned loquats with their leaves on. Rabbit'head pears and chicken'heart jujubes To quench your thirst, remove your cares, and sober you up. Fragrant peaches and tender apricots, As sweet and luscious as jade wine." This goes on for a page and a half. I think that just about explains it.  That said, this novel has a major upside: the actual story of the first seven chapters. Though it's largely considered a prologue by purists (most of whom just Wikipedia summaries of chapter eight and up) the wild adventure of Sun Wukong the monkey king, which I'll call Part One for convenience's sake, is the only part anyone really cares about. Poetry and lackluster prose aside, Part One is one big swashbuckling adventure, following Wukong's rise to power and war against Heaven. It's colorful, epic, and the only section that follows a consistant plot. It also contains some of the most famous moments in Chinese fiction, including Wukong's training (the basis for Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back), the Buddha's Palm scene, and one incredible chase sequence that really knocked me off my feet. When Part One wraps up, though, everything goes downhill.  The actual journey westward sees a main character switch and a change in format. The alleged meat-and-potatoes of the novel follows a monk named Xuanzang as he and his four desciples, including Wukong, as they travel to India to acquire a set of scriptures. This section takes from Chapter 8 to 97, and between those points, there is no concept of coherence or character development. It's entirely episodic and formulaic to a point where you can skip 95% of it and nothing will have moved forward. Most of these episodes consist of Xuanzang being kidnapped by a monster-of-the-week and Wukong saving him while their comrades contribute little to nothing at all. It gets old fast, and the overly direct translations don't help at all.  There is very little reason to keep reading after Part One. Some of the demons during the main quest are fun, I very much like the main party, even if none of them develop at all during the course of the story, but there isn't much to go on once Sun Wukong steps out of the limelight in Chapter 8. Instead, I recommend a few alternatives.  -The kid's TV series that aired on the BBC in the 80's, called "Monkey". It's pure, hyperactive, campy fun.  -The Chinese animated film "Havoc in Heaven" is a beautiful rendering of Part One only.  -Arthur Waley's famous abridged version, also called "Monkey" cuts out most of the repitition and all of the poetry. It's snappy, whimsical, and much better paced than the massive original.	0
While the story is long and can get repetitive at times, it is a classic.  If you wish to undersatnd the culture of China in any way, you must be familiar with this story.  Go Monkey!	1
One of the best books I've ever read. I got hooked to the book the monment I read the first 3 pages.	1
I only received the first Volume from the third-party seller.	1
IF you like mythic kung fu movies, you will be thrilled with this book.  Its 1000 times more baddazzz than any related movie or cartoon you could hope to see. I would compare it to the Oz books mixed with the Orlando epics.	1
Am looking forward to read it. E.Lauterbach	1
Bought for my son, he loves the books	1
although a great book, somewhat marred by a less than perfect translation (although let's give credit where credit is due, i would not have liked to edit this book) - this book reads somewhat like water.  about two thousand pages of the narrative deals with the journey of Priest, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand as they travel westward in search of the scriptures of the "Greater Vehicle" - the other three hundred pages deals with the birth of the Monkey King and his rebellion in heaven at the start of the book, and the end where they finally reach the Thunder Monastary on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven a.k.a. Tibet. pretty much the rest of the book deals with the trials and tribulations that these four monks (only three of which are fully developed characters: poor Friar Sand is left as the fifth wheel most of the time) go through in trying to 'fetch' these scriptures for the enlightenment of all humanity.  the priest is a real ding-dong, he's constantly getting himself into all sorts of trouble, and he never heeds the Monkey King's advice about anything, so the Priest is always falling into the jaws of some new monster on virtually every chapter.  the Pig is no better, as he would sooner run into trouble or create trouble for everyone else for the sake of either his pride or his stomach.  the Monkey King is the real hero of this book, as he is constantly rescuing everyone from some sort of demon or tempting succubus around practically every corner.  and what of Friar Sand? . . . well, he is just kind of there to guide the Priest's horse. this book is definitely worth a read though, i thoroughly enjoyed it, despite its short comings.  the incessant poetry gets kind of annoying though, most of it is relevant to the "plot" so you can't really skip too much of it.  i give it four stars.	1
i love this book. when i am reading the book i place it in my backpocket to be able to pickup and read whenver i have time. i cant seem to put this book down.	1
I got the product (Journey to the West 4 volume boxed set) fairly quickly, but the books were a little scuffed up with the corner of one of the four volumes bent up to a couple pages.  Being only a paperback though, this doesn't bother me much as they would have been in this condition or worse after I've finished it. :)  Otherwise good service, I contacted the seller in advance to confirm that the version of this book was the one I was looking for, since there are many retellings of Journey to the West, and I got a prompt reply.	1
Even people who don't have a scholarly or hobby interest in Chinese culture will enjoy this amazingly sassy, VERY VERY long epic about a quest to get instructions from the buddha.  Magic animals, lots of martial arts, poetic evocations of scenery.  It's really a lot of fun.  But you have to be a person who can commit to a very long story.  This book comes in four volumes.	1
Imagine "The Lord of the Rings" doubling its length, complexity of plots, the number of characters, monsters, spirits, and other beings of all kinds - then you get the idea of just what a monumental book this is.  It's like an encyclopedia written in the form of a novel!  It's also the most famous fanatasy fiction in the Chinese-speaking world.  Now that's a big deal. The Buddhist monk's mission is to walk all the way from the Chinese capital to India, a distance of at least 2000 miles.  By contrast, the distance between Hobbiton and Mordor is only about 1000 miles.  While the monk's goal is to take back Buddhist books from "the West," i.e., India, Frodo's task is to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom of Mordor, i.e., in the East. The Monk is to bring back something of great importance, the Hobbit to destroy it.  The Monk is a man of great wisdom, with an absolutely pure heart, but powerless and helpless in the face of monsters.  He commands the services of his pupil the Monkey King, who has limitless supernatural powers.  Hobbit's strength lies also in his purity of heart, which however fails only at the very end.  Otherwise he is just as powerless as the Monk.  Gandalf is the man of great wisdom and a tremendous wizard who assists Frodo.  "The Journey to the West" is permeated throughout with Buddhist overtones and undertones - like blood in the human body, they are everywhere.  Tolkien's book is pagan, of course, but the distinction between good and evil is no less sharp.  All characters return home heroes. Those who've read both books (or at least seen the films adapted from them) will appreciate the complexity of the Chinese imaginative mind.  Nothing Tolkien wrote can compare.  Curiously, little is known about this author, other than the great fame of his book.	1
It's a true classic and I am enjoying it very much.	1
very fast service,books in optimal condition, glad to have chosen amazon the book is very interesting, i chose it because i'm interested in china and i'm learning chinese and i like to read about places i've been in china.	1
Daily Deals is cool when you buy from them! First time dealing with Daily Deals! I am very happy with how they communicate with you!	1
good	1
A Chinese born friend told me about this story and how it is the basis for the TV series 'Monkey'. The book [compared to the TV show] is a superior experience.	1
This was purchased for my son for Christmas when I could not find it at the library.  He loved it and was happy to find that it came with 3 other books from the series in a collector box.	1
Absolutely perfect! Quick turn around from the states to Australia. Cheers :)	1
Even though I haven't read this book, I know exactly what it's about. If you have seen or read the first ten episodes of the Television show or manga "Dragon Ball" created by Akira Toryama in mid '80's, you'll see a similarity. The names are a little different, but the basic story is identical. If you are a Dragon Ball fan, you'll see where I'm coming from. This extremely long story about that old Chinese legend, inspired the great Akira in writing the greatest Japanese story ever written. Mainly, because it led to Dragon Ball Z, and then finally to Dragon Ball GT which has still not appeared in English, but probably will sometime in the near future. So, I'm going to but this story and see what else Akira based his popular Dragon Ball series on...	1
I really love this company. I will purchase from them again the book is as said in description very minor wear but everything else was in great condition.	1
This translation is not as flowery as the Anthony Yu translation and does not have the extensive footnotes but is a fun read.  Uses more modern language so it's  not necessary to constantly look up references to understand the story.	1
it is a classic for a reason.  it is good in a good way	1
I ordered this product around Christmas time, and it was intended to be a present for a friend. Unfortunately, the order became lost in the mail. I contacted Amazon with questions and options on what I could do to still receive this book set, and I received a prompt reply. The representative was very cooperative and friendly. A new box set was sent out soon after communications, and that set was received within a week. Thanks for the great books, everyone! My friend is loving them.	1
This is a wonderful translation of the Journey to the West.  It is an unabridged translation, therefore it is 3 books long.  But it is worth it.  Not only is it written clearly, but it keeps the style of the original, meaning that interwoven between pharagraphs of prose are poems.  This give the book a wonderful charm that the abridged, prose versions lack.  The ancient Chinese thought, such as yin and yang, Daoism, Chinese Buddhism, also give the book an authentic flavor that enriches the experience of reading this classic.  It is still the same wonderful story of the michevous Monkey King, his difficulties with the gods in heaven, and his redeeming pilgramage with the Buddhist monk/priest Sanzang to find sutras.  For anyone seriously interested in this story and who doesn't read Chinese, this is the edition for them!	1
Delivery speed was ok. Shipping rate was great considering the size and weight of this book collection. Books quality is as expected for paper edition.	1
The Journey to the West has remained of the most popular and enduring works of fiction in China since it was first published in the late sixteenth century.  It is an allegory of Buddhist doctrine, based on the real life pilgrimage of Tripitaka, a Chinese monk who traveled to India in search of religions scripture in (I believe) the seventh century.  The very descriptive text contains some of the most astoundingly beautiful poetic passages I have ever encountered.  Footnotes contain references to everthing from historical notes to daily customs of the period.  This set of books is among the most treasured in my library.	1
Anthony Yu version has more back ground info than WJFJ version. The quality of books is very poor. The paper quality is poor, printing quality is poor, and binding quality is poor. However this is newer translation(1982) than Anthony Yu version (1977). Though, I think some of poem are not right translation. Anthony Yu vesion is a bit diffcult to read.	1
I liked this book quite a bit. The translation is good and the translator has one a great effort to explain as much as he/she could to help you to understand anything that is mentioned and you mey be unable to understand. The only thing I found somewhat tiring was that the story becomes a little repetitive, but besides that the story is really interesting (though I got to hate Pig, but... *shrug*)	1
The classic novel 'Journey to the West' is well worth a read if you like Chinese history, or enjoy studying religion, or like mythology. While parts are dry, the novel overall is really interesting and I found most of it to be very engaging. Even though Monkey is insanely overpowered, and a lot of characters are two-dimensional (like Pig), the problems of the party always present a challenge and the trouble they get into and the struggles they have to overcome are varied and don't get boring (well, most of the time anyway. It's a long story and some parts are very repetitive). While this book is rich in detail and shows the incredible and complex Chinese Buddhist mythology and traditions beautifully, it's obvious that the author had a real hatred of Taoists. If you're a scholar of Buddhism or Chinese religions, this book is definitely a must-read, but be aware of the biases. The biggest problems I had were that this set of books (the novel is split into four parts) doesn't seem to have been proofread against typos and also seems to have been printed on quite low-quality paper. Also, some of the translation notes are cut off or are missing. Otherwise, this is a brilliant set of books. They're well worth the price.	1
This book is a bit of an odd read but it is interesting, I spent most of the train journeys reading this and bits of it are strange but it does link to the natural chinese history in ways which I was pleased about. A decent read but not the best of the chinese classics	1
I bought this as a mothers day gift as this is one of her favourite stories (she loved the old TV series) and she absolutely loved it. She spent the rest of the day annoying my Dad by reading out sections to him. Well worth the money!	1
It was not clear this was part of a trilogy	0
really good so far, am still on book one but I loved the abridged Monkey book so much I've been loving this one.  there are a lot of translated poems and such in there, which I don't get much out of, but they probably were brilliant in the original language.  such a shame.	1
I give my review a five-star rating because I really enjoy reading it.  It has exceeded my expectations.  I would certainly recommend to anyone who wants to have an understanding of a famous Chinese folklore.  In fact, many Chinese today who practise traditional Chinese ancestor worship pray to the Monkey God and he is revered as a deity and many Chinese temples of statues of the Monkey God.	1
A wonderful rambling adventure, full of magic, wit and insights into old China. I never saw the popular TV series 'Monkey' that came from this book, but if you did, you might like to read the book.	1
This is a lucid and superlative translation of this classic Chinese novel: Arthur Waley's abridgment 'Monkey'is great for getting the flavour of Wu Cheng'en's timeless novel but this complete translation by W.J.F Jenner, illustrated with many Ching period woodcuts, is a true delight and one at last appreciates the scope of 'Journey to the West' in all its amazing detail - it's a masterwork perhaps comparable to J.R.R Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' and the narrative is rich with weird adventures, bizarre and comedic episodes, wild combats, spiritual and poetic interludes and charged throughout with esoteric Taoist, alchemical and Buddhist symbolism as we follow the way via many vicissitudes to the Western Heaven and the Greater Vehicle scriptures with our heroes, the monk Tripitaka who is a sort of everyman on the spiritual quest through life, the irrepressible Monkey, who represents the mercurial mind so hard to control, and also the amazing magical powers of the immortal Taoist adept which nonetheless need to learn to be motivated and guided by the higher quality of Compassion and placed in the service of the enlightened Buddha-nature. Pigsy of course stands for the lower appetites and is a hilarious glutton and Friar Sand is a strange and earnest figure who defies definition. It would be a faint spirit indeed who could not take pleasure in the cunning strategems and heroic antics of the irascible Monkey King, the Great Sage Equalling Heaven - these characters are archetypal aspects of each of us and their great quest mirrors the journey of the spirit. This 3 volume translation is a joy to read and the exquisite poems which are embedded throughout really add to the full appreciation of this wonderful and intricate novel. Like 'The Golden Ass' of Apuleius it is richly humorous but beneath the phantastic episodes and the wild japes there is a serious message and purpose and the 'Journey to the West' is a profoundly spiritual novel. Was there ever a hero like the Handsome Monkey King!!	1
Wonderful	1
Funny, witty, thought provoking. An absolute treat.	1
quality book.	1
excellent value and prompt delivery	1
A long read but well worth the time.	1
This is the first half of the story of Sun Wukong, the Monkey-King, the piggy Shu Wuneng and the terrible Sha Wujing who in the Tang-time converted to Buddhism to accompaign the Tang-priest Sanzang to the Westerly Heaven - today's India - to find Buddha, show him reference and return to the country of Tang with some Scriptures. Starting with Monkey's brith and teaching up to his revolt in the Heavenly Palace and his following banishment this book tells about how the four came together and about the first half of their monsters-, demons- and other things infested journey. It is also a show and an indirect discussion of Taoism, Buddhism and Konfuzianism and how this philosophical schools have influenced each other. The story of Monkey and his comrades has often been adapted to other forms, like movies, plays, TV-serials, and comics (e.g. "Dragonball") and is starting with its creation in the 16th century certainly one of the most influential pieces of literature - even if outside of China most people have seldom heard of it. The edition in hand is quite comprehensive, but the editing is a bit sloppy, so that quite often homophones have been mixed in the final text, which makes the reading a bit strenuous in parts. For this - not for the quality of the work itself - one star has been deducted.	1
Una edición compacta y completa de la obra a un precio inmejorable. Son cuatro volúmenes y la calidad del papel es buena para una edición compacta. Hay ilustraciones de la epoca y una buena introducción ademas la editorial es para mi garantía.	1
I'm still on Book One and I'm finding it a great read.  I haven't been this engrossed in a mythical work since Lord of the Rings.  This work predates that great work by centuries.  I love the mix of poetry and prose,  that conveys what I imagine is true to the original Chinese.  I love it.	1
Please be careful when buying these sets! Twice now I have purchased thinking all 4 volumes are included but unfortunately only 1 book has been given	0
Parfait état, délais raisonnables.	1
Amazing storytelling	1
The books are awesome! The product came very quickly and in pristine condition!	1
Bought it for my son & was exactly as he expected it!!😊	1
Great condition	1
Product was as expected, on time and at a good price.	1
This is a distillation of Yu’s faithful translation of the 100 chapter, 4-volume The Journey to the West, the part historical, part mythical epic of Chinese literature which has been the basis for numerous movies, animes. and memes.  The essential first 8 chapters of the original, which tell how Monkey becomes a force to be reckoned with, are condensed to 7; most of the trimming comes after the divine monk Tripitaka Tang sets out to bring Buddhist scriptures from India back to China, since his encounters with obstacles become a bit repetitive in the long version. The monk is actually the incarnation of a Heavenly being who volunteered to suffer human birth in order to bring the means of enlightenment to the people of the East. But once he is mortal he will lose his divine perceptions and be vulnerable to illusions, deceptions, and wrong thinking, so he is assigned 4 assistants, all of them immortals who have fallen into disgrace one way or another. (Don’t drop a teacup or set fire to Heavenly curtains, and especially don’t steal all the peaches.) Their task is to transport him safely, thereby winning their freedom to return to their former estates. This assignment is made difficult by several factors. At least two of the disciples loathe each other and are forever squabbling and fighting. Pigsy is lazy and wants to go back to eating meat and having sex; Monkey wants to go back to being King of the Flower Fruit Mountain. Only the gold fillets that act like 16th century tasers keep the unruly disciples from rebellion. Thieves and politicians bar their way. The major difficulty, however, is that every monster who wants a short cut to immortality, bypassing all that tedious self-cultivation, wants to devour the monk, for it is widely known that even one mouthful of Tripitaka’s flesh will prolong life, and making a meal of him will bestow longevity. Time and time again Monkey exerts himself on the monk’d behalf, saving Tripitaka from hungry monsters who disguise themselves as damsels in distress or feeble patriarchs, when they don’t simply capture the travelers by a frontal assault. The story is magnificent adventure, incorporating poetry, allusions to esoteric medicine and meditation practices, breathtaking descriptions of travel, ferocious fight sequences, and braggadocio exchanges between combatants. It is so refreshing to encounter a classic that isn’t inherently a tragedy based on war or lust for power, thirst for revenge. Instead, this epic centers around a quest to benefit all of creation by promoting enlightenment. In the style of the poems included in this translation, here is a summary: From a mountain stone egg is born The Mind Monkey. This one studies the Tao, Masters transformations and defeats the lords of death, Devours immortal peaches and Heavenly feasts, Challenges the divine champions, Defeating all — all but one. Only Quanyin’s intercession Frees Monkey to pursue once again The Way as a Heavenly monk’s disciple, One of four magical beings who serve and guard Tripitaka Tang on his quest for scriptures. Not always willingly. Pigsy loves earthy pleasures, Monkey resorts to violence. Over mountains and across rivers, Eluding traps and subduing demons, The five companions refine their spirits. Who will find the Way within the way?	1
First off: I'm really glad this was an abridgment-- the 100-chapter, four-volume complete story sounds utterly overwhelming. I've read long books, and I've read the entire Harry Potter series multiple times, but classic books are at time more difficult to digest than modern novels. Secondly, remember that this story is hundreds of years old. Some of the story-telling styles are old-school. If you've read other ancient books and stories, you might know what I mean. It's not organized the way a modern story might be, and while it is entertaining, it had its own religious goals as well. But don't forget to enjoy the ridiculous antics the characters often take part in. This leads me to my next point: it helped me to have some background knowledge before reading this book. While the translator/editor of this book adds a few footnotes, it doesn't explain the basics. To enjoy this story more, I would recommend attaining a little background knowledge of Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and ancient China. But no worries on becoming an expert! This is still an enjoyable story, at times adventurous and at times hilarious. I had to look up some things such as "what does 'kowtow' mean?" and "what are the eight trigrams?" and the like. But as I familiarized myself with this book and its contents, I began to understand some of the references to it. For example, I discovered that many animes draw on mythologies, including this story. Goku in Dragon Ball is based on the monkey of this book, as is a tailed beast in Naruto. Other references (especially in anime, but not exclusively) came not directly from this book, but from religious characters/items/stories/etc. mentioned in this book. I feel like I learned a lot both in reading this book and seeking to understand not only the story itself, but the background that goes into it.	1
This labor of love from Anthony Yu is an amazing translation for English readers!  In the preface Mr. Yu discusses his reasons for wanting to provide a culturally accurate translation for English readers.  Being a native speaker of Chinese and growing up in the culture as well as being a professor of Asian studies and history in an English speaking country is really what makes this translation so amazing.  The footnotes at the bottom of each page were an especially nice detail. Oftentimes with weighty classics like this all the footnotes are either at the end of the book with the appendices or at the end of the chapter.  This leads to a lot of fumbling around and flipping pages back and forth and can subsequently take you out of your reading experience.  It is also easier, at least for me, to forget some of the context of what I was reading doing all this flipping back and forth.  Not only do the footnotes themselves add immensely to the depth of understanding of the material but having them at the bottom of the page they are referencing makes reading easy and enjoyable.  Culture specific footnotes really helped me understand the intensity of the situations I was reading about as well as just how funny this book is. As far as the story itself I think everyone should read it.  The story is hilarious and surprisingly modern in its storytelling despite the time it was written.  So many of the most famous animes in pop culture clearly have taken major inspiration from this story.  DBZ alone has ripped off so many elements you'll find yourself laughing at the similarities if you have ever watched DB or DBZ. Highly, HIGHLY recommend!!  Read now please!	1
This long but nevertheless abbreviation of the Chinese classic story of the journey from China to India of the Buddhist monk Tripitaka to bring to China manuscripts of the teachings of the Buddha. The characters are spectacular, especially Monkey whose magical performances save the mission from disaster. The bizarre adventures involving magic and courage are at times very amusing and always astonishing at the invention and imagination of those who wrote this amazing and highly readable, scholarly translated work. The story has been translated into many languages, made into films and simplified versions published for children. Not to be missed.	1
Ugh, this is just not an entertaining read for me.  The humor may bring a chuckle to Asian readers of the 16th century Ming dynasty but this is way too dry for me.  I would suggest checking it out from a library prior to purchasing it to see if it is what you expected.  Just because everyone else tells you that the monkey is handsome don't believe them, like the Emperor of old, he wears no clothes.	0
GREAT book. I have never read the 1942 version but I imagine it must leave out a LOT. Considering Anthony C Yu's full unabridged version is 4 times the length of his here abridged version, this version is a great starting point. A must read for all interested in Chinese literature and a MUST for all Dragonball fans! You really get a sense of Goku and his world by reading this classic epic story.	1
Good translation and the abbreviated version maintains the spirit and I don't feel like I miss much by not purchasing each individual tome	1
Cool book. LOTS of typos. Is it hard to pay people to read these things before you publish them?	1
You probably need to appreciate ancient Chinese culture and it’s historic interaction with Buddhism to appreciate this novel. This was a delightful journey with a group of colorful characters that keep struggling to learn and grow. The rhythm of the story telling becomes a fun structure for these little adventures. I didn’t miss the unabridged version for a moment.	1
Incredibly well written such that it seems to preserve the culture and voice of the original work. It is excellent, and does not feel like you're reading sparknotes, which is the experience I had with a different translated abridgement of Journey to the West.	1
Loved this version and sent it as a birthday gift to my son, who loved it as well. Great story to share with your kids. Recommend it all over the place.	1
I love 'Journey to the West' - the story is China's version of 'The Canterbury Tales', and the tales found within are both seminal works of Chinese literature and rewarding reads in and of themselves.  For this particular edition, Anthony Yu does a good job of translating into English: the prose text is very readable, and Yu's footnotes provide a lot of help on obscure references to Chinese superstitions and Buddhist heritage.  The translations of the poems are somewhat less satisfying, and I found myself frequently skipping over them to read just the prose storyline.  My main complaint is with the books Yu decides to include here: out of the 100 chapters of the full edition, Yu includes only the 31 chapters that are crucial to the plotline.  As a result, you get the barebones story, but some of the best-written and most comical subplots are left out.  All in all, though, a pretty good read, especially for anyone looking for the middle ground between the comic book versions and the full 4-volume 100-chapter text.	1
What a great book, I was sad when I got to the end that there was no more. Its amazing it was written hundreds of years ago and still has relevant moderns themes and insights. The mix of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism is special. Such an unusual story of myth, fairytale, proverb and religion, all with beautiful imagery and fun.	1
If a story seemed too long because of the vast amount of volume and you just want a good read in one book. This is it. Journey to the West is an epic that needs to be read and this is the version to read in one go.	1
This is a superb printing of this translation in a manageable soft cover.	1
Anthony Yu indeed is an excellent translator, summing up the most essential chapters to give a flavor of the importance spiritual depth of this book. It will engage readers to want to study further in his full translation version!	1
One of the best told stories of all time. Thank you!	1
The story is so full of adventure , I can see why it's still so popular after so long !	1
a classical must read chinese epic	1
I guess it alright.	1
Very interesting book!	1
This is the best translation you will find Anthony C Yu has really made this book shine, it displays all that only people who can read Chinese could only know until now ,previous books in English on the monkey king have been dry and lacking in spirit this book is beautifully descriptive and spiritually deep at the same time,but don't let the word spiritual throw you off this book is full of adventure and excitement, not a boring moment to be found. .P.S. this is the abridged version of the 3 volume full version.I usually don't bother with abridged books but got this one to read to my [...]son,not only does my son love this,but I love just as much as the whole set	1
After reading the complete set a few years ago, I thought it would be fun to re-read the abridged version when it came out. As far as I can tell, the author has simply selected certain chapters from the full set to create this one book version. I'm realizing now that I don't really want to "skip" chapters! What's the rush anyhow? When I finish this, I'll be looking for my next book to read. I believe the first 15 chapters are the same in BOTH versions; so if unsure, you could start with the short one and switch over...	1
Glad to have it.	1
This an abridgement of a famous Chinese novel beloved by kids and adults all over as Asia. Unfortunately this a not very readable translation that appears to be aimed at scholars, The choice of multisylabic  words where simple words. There is also a lot a obscure Buddhist and  Taoist poetry interspersed in the text that I could not head nor tails of. Very distracting from the story.	0
This book is a great book to use to learn about Chinese culture. The story here is a classical of Chinese literature and is written in a way that makes it clear for anyone to understand. A good read.	1
TMatM tells a story that happens to be one of the most well-known tales in Asia: "The Monkey King's Journey to the West". The story is profound and funny - and very different from any tale you may hear in this  side of the globe. By reading it, you get to know a lot about the basis of a whole culture. The Monkey King was the inspiration - direct or otherwise - for many mangá creators. Suggested for people who are really interested in the Asian culture.	1
Mr Yu already translated the entire book and did it very well. That translation has been extant for around 30 years. So why publish only a little readers digest condensed one? I want the whole thing for my Kindle. I would be happy to pay commensurately with the increased volume. Come on give us a break, people who read this stuff at all want the whole thing.	0
Interesting to note that Xuanzang's journey coincided with the Taoist alchemist's failed attempt to create the elixir of life (immortality). He blundered into gunpowder instead, thus sending mankind down the road to Prometheus, Pandora, and perdition rather than up and over the fabled hill of Sisyphus to the Shangri-la realm of Asklepios and Panacea. The tamed Monkey controlled initially by a fillet and later by himself represents the victory of Buddhism's metaphorical immortality over Taoism's failed experiments in real immortality.  Had Tony Yu made this point in his preface, I'd have given him 5 stars. Note:  Joseph Needham is very good on Taoist alchemy and gunpowder.	1
1) The translation is poor.  For example, when Sun Wukong ("Monkey") calls himself "lao3 sun1" in Chinese, Yu translates that into "old Monkey."  This is just dumb.  Something like a plain "I" or "this old monkey" would have worked better.  There are many such examples.  The translated English text almost requires you to know Chinese to understand.  Definitely not for the masses. 2) I can't believe most of the stories in the 2nd half of the original novel are omitted.  This abridged edition seems to focus on the first half of the Xiyouji ("Journey to the West") novel.  Great stories like the Ox King and the nymphs are completely cut out.  This is just absolutely terrible.  On the other hand, the uninteresting, semi-religious side stories about the origin of Xuanzang (Tang Sanzang) are kept.  What's more, all those poems in the chapters that are included here are retained -- you know, Chinese poems (shi and ci) that are extremely difficult to translate which should have been left out of an abridged edition. In short, don't get this book.  It's absolutely terrible and a waste of money.  You might as well get the unabridged translation, by either Yu (expensive) or by Waley (old but affordable).  But if you really want to appreciate the great novel, you should study Chinese (5-6 years full-time) and then read the original Chinese edition.	0
I brought the book to read at a book group and it elicited an excellent wide ranging discussion.	1
Great abridgment of a Chinese classic - still feels like you're reading something ancient without being totally incomprehensible.	1
Just as ordered.	1
Love it! I would recommend anyone to read this book!	1
NOT THE FULL TEXT....these are the  cliff notes......product page is awful.	0
This is a ~15 page "summary" of the book. Ordered this thinking it was the full text because it doesn't say otherwise in the description.	0
Looks like someone printed a PDF I could have found for free online. The book is too wide and tall and the layout, indentation, and general typography are awful.	0
I want to tell future readers of this book in this way. I read it first when I was 14 or 15. I thought it was a book on how to smartly fight a war. Then I re-read it when I was 28 and it occurred to me that it may be an instruction book on how to navigate an honorable life. Years passed and I recently found it at the bottom of a box in my closet. I read it again at age 56. I realized it has more to offer. If you read this book, you will actively have to replace Sun Tzus' ancient terms and placement of hierarchy and apply them to modern situations and people. Family, bosses, neighbors, employees and the list goes on. It is my belief that this "manual" can help solve minor and major disruptions in life if used correctly. It is a book meant for good.	1
This is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.  It should say PUBLIC DOMAIN as it is like a copy from someone who took notes off of someone who took notes who took notes off someone who doesn't even write in the English language!  It is woefully abridged (to the max) looks like it was not edited or proofread and I loathe it.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL	0
This is the single best translation of The Art of War — the one used in history courses and the military. Why? Because it's JUST The Art of War. No long intros. No author's notes. No commentary. No 10 pages of history or Sun Tzu biography. It's simply the text of The Art of War translated by an international group of Chinese- and English-speaking scholars. Period. It's the *definitive* text. Complaining about it being short is like complaining about the Gettysburg Address being short. It IS short. That's the POINT. If you want to read dozens of pages of commentary and history and footnotes and acknowledgements, buy a lesser version. If you want to read The Art of War, buy this one.	1
 Idk, maybe I didn't read the reviews in my Xmas shopping haste? But this is NOT The Art of War you're used to. This is a very thin, 67 page cliffnote version. And it'd be nice if they listed that pertinent fact in the headline 🙄 Kinda just a waste of resources sending it back, of time for me, and a loss for the seller. Annoying.	0
Interesting book, everybody sites The Art of War as the top book for combat, business, and all types of other endeavors. It's a little difficult to just read however it has tons of wise principles. You do have to think somewhat abstractly in order to benefit from this book, but overall I think it's worth having and worth reading. Certainly not the type of book you would read like anovel...	1
I really appreciate having read this book. It oriented my mind in a favorable way towards using and thinking about certain mindfulness-based strategical tactics. I appreciate the guidance and motivational support written within the pages. This was a quick, easy read for me and will be a lasting reference for years to come. I highly suggest this to everybody. It is a classic must-read in my opinion. I was not compensated in any way for this review. I like to give open, honest and transparent feedback about products I like to try. I hope you found this review to be useful. If so, please click the 'Helpful' button to let myself and others know that it has helped you.	1
It seems like I have heard about the classic book, "The Art of War," for as long as I can remember. I finally decided to buy the book from Amazon. Red flags, bells, and whistles should have went off inside my head when I only paid $3.99 for the book. This is not the original book that I had anticipated reading. This is more or less a summary of "The Art of War," by Sun Tzu. It is my responsibility to be aware of what I am purchasing. I rated this book with 3-stars because I did find nuggets of wisdom splattered throughout the book. Beware! If you intend on purchasing "The Art of War," by Sun Tzu the $3.99 is not the copy to buy.	1
This was an incredibly economical buy. A good price on a legendary literary work. However, it should be pointed out that this was a public domain reprint and the publishing company did not cite nor include the translator of this piece in any way, it is simply "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu. The quality of the print is very good and the material seems to all be there, although, there are many blank pages as shown in the attached image. Again, I did not notice any material actually missing or out of context. I would not purchase this book if you are looking to reference it for scholarly sources or any work in which you would have to reference the content directly. I would definitely encourage the buy if it is for personal use or work that does not require proper citations.	1
-If you have inconsistent or poor performances on your team, you NEED to read this book! -If you are the type of leader that is "too nice" and you feel like your employees take advantage of you, you NEED to read this book! -If your employees are terrified of you, you NEED to read this book! This is how this book changed my life: My first big promotion was getting the General Manager position of a restaurant at 21 years old, and I did everything I could to make my employees happy (bringing the principals from "First Break All the Rules- What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently" which is also imperative to help you measure and understand how to make an amazing work environment for your employees), and it worked wonders- at first. My employees were happy and my customer reviews sky rocketed!! However, over time some employees started to push the lines of respect with me and others, and some just started to outright ignore me or give me attitude. I was devastated! How could they treat me disrespectfully after I had spent months bending over backwards finding out and giving them everything they needed to be happy at work??? I praised them tirelessly, I thanked them constantly, I encouraged them, I personally trained them, I got them equipment and supplies they need to do a good job, I was spending one-on-one time with each of them would ask how their lives were, etc! I was the "nicest boss...." who was also turning out to be a pushover. You can have all the kindness in the world but it makes your team useless if you have no discipline at the same time! The Bible says God disciplines His children BECAUSE He loves us. Otherwise, we turn into monsters! Which is what I was beginning to experience with my team. I HAD NO DISCIPLINE, and NEITHER DID MY TEAM. Why would they respect me? I thought discipline was bad- "punishment" you gave and "punishment" was mean. Nope... turns out every team needs it, and if you are CONSISTENTLY and FAIRLY giving predictable and fore-warned discipline all the time, along with kindness, which Sun Tzu talks about in the book as well, you will have an amazing team. This is my favorite quote from the book that finally turned the light bulb on for me:  Page 26 #42-45: "If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual." AND YES IT WAS! Over time, not only did my employees love coming into work EVEN MORE, but they worked harder, my customers were happier, and so was I. People are comforted to know their boss will always be kind AND fair. If you never know how your boss will treat you, it creates uncertainty and anxiety with the team that always leaks out to the customers. It took me only a couple weeks to begin fully implementing this mindset with my employees. At first, I'm not going to lie- it shocked them a bit and they didn't believe when me I would tell them I would be disciplining them if they didn't follow through or finish a direct order I had given them. I had to fire one manager who was undermining me to the team, and then everyone saw I was serious and fell right into line. Of course, I did all of this will extreme kindness. Discipline should never be nasty or hateful or done when you are fuming angry. The employees need kind, proper and consistent warnings before they receive any consequences (which I learned to start doing right from onboarding them at orientation- saved me a lot of time and trouble), and then if and when the time comes for the formal discipline, they know by then that it was totally their choice, and you are only following through on what you said would happen. There are SO MANY MORE GREAT QUOTES in this book. Just get it. Get a highlighter and pick out the diamonds that you need. Go over them time and again and become the amazing leader of your life and of your team you are meant to be!	1
Ordered for my daughter, who is in ministry and all 20 campuses of her ministry are required to study this book. She received a flimsy pamphlet, if you will, that is not the book itself. Extremely disappointed as she ordered this about a month ago and it just arrived, and she's already behind because it should not have taken this long to receive a book when I have a Prime account. Then to receive the incorrect book made things worse, and we cannot go out and purchase the book for her to have immediately. This was a huge waste, time-consuming, and extremely disappointing. We should have read the reviews first, as we see there are others who've encountered this same problem.	0
As a person who has a  passion for reading I am also a young teenager who is often times lost on what direction to go in life. After reading this book and studying the literature within this ancient book I feel like I can accomplish my hardest challenges.	1
Very nice and great for desktop but i didnt realize it was a tiny version. I order these leather look books all the time and they are always standard to large size so my bad for not reading the description. That said, nice product and great to just toss around on a desktop or whatever......too small for a bookshelf. Love it, keeping and reading it but a little pricey for th3 size as i get full size volumes for my collection all the time for this price.	1
I really wish I had read all the reviews before purchasing this. It is all things you can find online for free. 15 pages of wide set typing and this author's take on what is actually in the real book. This thing is TINY because it is not the entire text. This is really false advertising. I didn't want a book report by an unknown source.	0
Confused . Is this supposed to be a summary? I only see bulletin points. Not what I expected	1
Do not buy this book. It’s a small preview of the real Art of War book. Consider this: if you get this book it’s about 68 total pages. The real Art of War is 273 pages. That means if you buy this “book” you’ll be missing 205 pages from the real book. That’s *a lot* of important information. This is a scam book, do not buy it. Spend your money elsewhere.	0
Are you person of interest of war? Are you a strategist? Do you like war? What entices you? If you answer all of these questions, this book will definitely make worth of your enjoyment during your boring or slow day. It'll be like taking a candy from a baby once you finish this book. However, if you plan to buy this book, you must be ready and be willing to be a fighter like the wind, such as Muhammad Ali, Yi Soon Shin, and other great heroes who have fought through many challenges and won them through the end.	1
This Audio Book has no commentary and is the writings of The Art of War by Sun Tzu only. I have The Art of War in written form with and without Commentary and frankly like the version without commentary better. I really like this Audio version. The reader has a good voice, easy to understand and doesn't interject his personal emotional  feeling during the reading. It is read in narrative form without the reading of Chapter number or or number of the paragraphs. For example Attack by Fire or The Use of Spies, followed by Sun Tzu says, then the subject under that heading.  This is actually a plus for me since it's very easy to follow the logic under each area of instruction, making a very smooth easy to follow narrative. A person can follow along with a written copy if they wish, but I found myself laying the book down, kicking back, and simply listening to the smooth logical, easy to follow reading. This is a small audio book but very enjoyable and still instructional. I have listened to this several times and still learn and just plain enjoy the reading.  At 69 years old that sometimes isn't easy with some Audio Books I have. I do recommend this one. You can download this into Media Player and make a Playlist, the chapter headings are shown, you can't bookmark if you stop but I simply write down the chapter I stopped in and the verse on a slip of paper in my written copy which allows me to come back later and pick up where I left off in the Audio Book. There may be an easier way but I don't know it. Hope this helps someone.	1
Historical references, (in translated Chinese) and other notes, litter the text, making it very difficult to follow the flow and primary scope of the book. Secondly, there are hundreds of instances of spaces missing between words! How the heck does that happen? Who proof-read, this book, a 5-year old? It was free, so there's that. I'm thinking of spending money and purchasing a different version that I can actually follow.	0
I’m about halfway through the book and it’s very well written, straight to the point, and easy to grasp. Love it. There is a minor typo on page 27, #4. It says “effected by the science...”, should be “affected by the...”. I highly doubt anyone would be thrown off by this typo or even notice it, just figured I’d mention it if you plan on coming out with a new edition at some point. Sorry, I’m a little ocd at times. But as I said, I absolutely love the book and the way it’s laid out!	1
This was self-published. To make some money I suppose. Nothing wrong with that. But it shows poor editing. A number of misspelled words and a few other errors that could have been detected if the editing were better.	1
This is one of those books that should be a mandatory read in school, probably high school in order to have the students understand the ideas and concepts presented. I finally read this book after retiring from work and found that a lot of the ideas (such as the one who plans beforehand will succeed) were things I learned while working and some of the rest were more or less common sense. If more people read this while they were teenagers, I think we would have a population that was a bit more common-sensical about their lives instead of just going with what feels best at the moment.	1
This is the cliff note version of The Art of War. This is falsely advertised and I am extremely disappointed. Returning it ASAP.	0
the Art of War by Sun Tzu is a concise treatise packed with wisdom.  Countless reams of scholarly research has been generated in the millenia since Sun Tzu wrote this masterpiece. Unfortunately, this edition seems to jam all of that research as inline notes into the text itself.  It is virtually impossible to distinguish what Sun Tzu wrote contrasted against what someone else wrote about Sun Tzu.  The research is good; it's just impossible to read through. I tried to read this, but got so fed up that I edited   of "the Art of War" with all of the notes and research linked into an appendix instead of inline with the text.  As a result, you can read "the Art of War" free from the interruptions and distractions of scholars and analysts.  Still, if you want that research, it's available in the appendix.  Every section links to its related notes, and even the related notes link to one another. In full disclosure, I am the editor of the copy that I linked to, but I think you'll find it much easier to read.  (After all, I should.)  If you prefer this free edition, do yourself a favor, and start at location 505.  That is the beginning of Sun Tzu's work, and will let you skip all of the introduction which is little more than the translator's story of this work.	0
The book is a shortened version. I thought this was the full version. Amazon let me return it with no issues. The book was in great condition and would have been perfect if it was the full version.	1
There's a reason this is a classic. However this copy ups it quite a bit by making the page font not to big but not trying to smash as must text together as possible; I found the read enjoyable. Great words of wisdom inside, but the quality of the book itself is top notch. It's cheap and shipped fast, which is great given COVID. Definitely add this to your book collection.	1
The delivery was quick & the book arrived in great condition (it was new). The Art of War: I have heard this book quoted often. It has some medium and some very interesting parts. Many broad generalizations. To apply it to business is malpractice (too Machivalian). It is a quick read and I recommend it just to be well rounded in a literary sense. I have heard it described as the ramblings of a retired General which seems accurate. I recommend reading it.	1
Made me want to go to war with my dog..... very informative and a great outlook on life	1
THIS BOOK IS NOT CLIF NOTES! This is The Art of War as written by Sun Tzu and translated to English. This version however does not include the commentary by the translator. There has been many versions of The Art of War translated into English over the years by many different people and all of them will vary in length. The bulk of the book that people are talking about is the sometimes 300+ pages of commentary by the translator and in some editions a 20+ page forword and sometimes a 60+ page introduction. This is the bare bones unabridged edition of The Art of War as written by Sun Tzu and translated into English. You are not missing any content from The Art of War itself. You are just missing (in my opinion) meaning was commentary from the translator and any forwards or introductions some versions may have. As far as Sun Tzu's writings they are fully intact.	1
Not really what I was expecting. If you want the cliff notes of a masterpiece so you can tell your friends you've read it, this is for you.  If you want the real thing, pay better attention than I did.	0
ISBN-13: 978-1599869773 I bought this book and it was seriously shorter than I thought. It is the book with a black cover and white font on it. It had absolutely no commentary or anything in it. Just the stuff by Sun Tzu. Still....it's so short! I guess for the price it makes sense. As for word choice in this particular book, Wikipedia had better translations of the chapters. For example, chapter 3 in the book is labeled, "Attack by Stratagem." It feels so clumsy compared to "Strategic Attack." With the amount of blank pages in the book(after every chapter), they could have easily filled in the original Chinese for side by side comparison. I probably would have just read this online. A paper copy is good to have around, but because the price is cheap, the book paper quality is cheap as well. There seems to be little effort in formatting too. The book is in an ubiquitous font like Times New Roman. This book simply did not fit my needs for the reasons above, and I will probably be searching for another book. However if you are looking to have a simple copy of The Art of War in paperback form, this is the right book for you.	0
Great book a lot of knowledge on how cut throat the world is	1
Definitely had some life lessons in here my favorite quote from the book “If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle” Each chapter has a life lesson you can apply to your everyday life	1
The Art of War is "the book" for both military history buffs and would be business leaders since the principles and strategies outlined by Sun Tzu are applicable on the battle field and in the meeting room. That being said, I have read other versions of this book over the years and have always found something of interest, so when my college age daughter asked me about it we picked up this one for her Kindle. I was surprised when she said it was hard to follow so downloaded it to my Kindle, and I was shocked that Thomas Cleary went way over the top with his comments and analysis, bogging down the flow and relatively easy understand original language. In fact, it is the clear and simple way Sun Tzu expressed his "rules" that has made his book so popular and relevant for the past 2000 years or so. The solution is straight forward enough since the translation is good, all of the text is there and it is easy enough to skim through Mr. Cleary's contributions. Recommended, with the above caveats. CFH	1
I ordered this book for a Psychology class I was taking, so it was a required read. I actually ordered is via Amazon for Kindle. It was an easy read, nothing really to complex or difficult to understand. Basis of this book is that it was written in China over two thousand years ago, Sun Tzu's The Art of War provides the first known attempt to formulate a rational basis for the planning and conduct of military operations. His essays contain principles acted upon by such twentieth-century Chinese generals as Mao Zedong. The book is translated by the late Samuel B. Griffith. Samuel Griffith offers an insightful translation of this classic, which makes it even more relevant to the modern world. If you are taking a class and need the book or just want to brush up on your twentieth century military tactics, I suggest this book. I hope this review helps.	1
I thought it was gonna be a big book like the original scripture but i guess it's ok for a short read replica.	0
I haven't served in a military so I'm not qualified to comment on the quality of the analysis in this book.  However, according to Wikipedia, many military organizations and many successful generals have read and benefitted from this work.  Based on their reputations, I'll accord this classic the respect that it claims. Throughout the book, the author describes the morale and motivation of people and how it will affect what they actually do.  An army is not a collection of chess pieces or cardboard counters that behave according to some printed rules.  It's a group of humans that will fight, retreat, give up, or go crazy, depending on what they experience. I have to take off one star.  The free Kindle edition has an overly long introduction plus a large amount of in-body notes.  The in-body notes look way to similar to the text.  I want to read more of Sun Tzu's words, and more important, I want it obvious which words are Sun Tzu's and which are not.	1

Lessons from this book can help you in many facets of your life. Not just war... but that too!	1
There are a number of factors that make this book worthwhile, although not necessarily the ones I expected.  I thought this would be a metaphor for life or business, but its actually a pretty tactical book on the details of prosecuting a war.  Its one of those books that is so broadly read and studied that its pretty necessary background for studying wars generally.  If you are reading other books on war for example, you can be pretty sure that most of the players have been influenced by this book.  Further, there's just a lot of interesting advice in here, "There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare" and thus there are instructions on how important it is to bring a conflict to a head and a swift conclusion.  Its a classic for a reason, and even if you don't find it compelling given the sheer number of people that have been influenced by it, it becomes a must read based on that alone.  I can certainly imagine I'll be quoting from this on multiple occasions.	1
If you have a thirst for knowledge (it is power) get this read it and read it again. I bought handful and just gave them away. First read it mid 90's in the ARMY, but when I came back to it in a different stage in life was able to apply it still. I forgot how helpful this book is. Stay blessed, stay ready.	1
4.5 Stars is misleading I should have looked more closely.  This is NOT the full book as others point out.  If you dig you can find that out from the listing but it's not immediately clear so it's deceitful.  All can be had for free with a simple Google search.	0
It is just a confusing translation, not really accurate, I read it before in other language and it had more context and content, so they may cut it out a little bit, also there are 10 principal rules written by Sun Tzu in the book they describe 13 just different, I don't like it.	0
The Art of War is required reading for U.S. Marine officers, so I wanted to get my own copy for my bookshelf. Of course, the best option would be to learn Chinese and study the original text. Short of that, a good translation is required. If Mr. Giles is a good translator, he's a horrible editor. This edition uses no style markings to denote what is from the original or what is editorial. As you can see by viewing the first few pages on this item's page, you can see that everything runs together. The reader can't possibly get a feel for the style or composition of the original because the entire text is peppered with commentary, not all of which is bracketed off by the the editor, and none of which is even set into its own area or paragraph. There are no footnotes, endnotes, or index. Keep looking if you're interested in reading Sun Tzu's masterpiece. I'll update this review when I've found an edition suitable for reading and recommending--this one is going back to Amazon today.	0
This book was an adequate copy. The book I received was the full length text, but chapter 10 and 6 were switched in the book for some reason though. Some of the translations were different from other publications of the book. I believe that this book does not read as well as some other publications because of the differences in phrasing, but this does not hurt the content of the text. Seems as if this publisher is a bit of a dice roll with what some of the other reviews are saying, but there does seem to be a positive trend.	1
You buy stuff cheap, that's what you get: cheap stuff. I think this was literally printed on standard bond print paper in 12 pt times new roman or something. more like a pamphlet than a book.	0
I was looking to reference the Art of War by Sun Tzu so I decided to order a copy. I must say that this is only a "Part" of the original, dare say a footnote of the original.  Very disappointed. Now I need to order a full copy of the book somewhere.... smh.	0
I watched a documentary about Sun Tzu and I decided to read the book. I didn't personally like the way this book is written it's all numbered and based on different topics and themes but overall the content of this book is gold. One of my favorite find from the book was: Let your rapidity be that of the wind and your compactness that of the forest!	1
Don't buy, it's a weird fake abbreviated version, check the other reviews if you don't believe me.	0
This should be removed from the store -- it's clear this version was auto-generated, either badly auto-translated or generated using synonyms from an existing translation (to avoid copyright issues), it's literally junk and doesn't make sense Sample sentence: "the high-quality issue of all is to take the enemy's united states of america entire and intact." Really bugs me that Amazon allows this kind of thing to slide, very frustrating.	0
This book is better than the Bible. This book is older than the Bible. This book is the Bible of War. The ancient, practical advise imparted in this book is still relevant today and is applicable to every instance of human competition: known your enemy as you know yourself, develop a strategy, vary your tactics, strength is in unity, and plan in secrecy. I looked for one good man amongst a million, but I could not find one good woman: spies.	1
Its a good book got this for my boyfriend because hes a man and hes easily influenced he heard a pod cast guy say its a good book bought this book for him as a valentines gift amd read before handing it over its an easy ready not long finished it in a day	1
The Kindle version of the book is missing spaces between words.  With this deficiency layered on the author's frequent bracketed interjections, footnotes and cross-page references, addition of numerous names and locations, the core message is all but unintelligible for me as a first time reader of the Art of War and novice in Chinese history and historical geography.  The author seeks to improve upon previous translations by pulling the best from each, adding his own, and contextualizing.  This noble purpose may have backfired because I am leaving this version of the book feeling I should have read Tu Mu's version, which the author quoted frequently and which seems lucid and easy to understand.	0
Nowhere in the description did it state that this was not the full work. I feel duped. DO NOT RECOMMEND !	0
Everyone should read this book. I have revisited this book many times over the years, and am always glad I did. A lot of lessons to be learned. And while I don't find myself at 'War' often, there are amazing lessons here that can be applied to everyday interactions that just about everyone of us find ourselves in. It's well worth your time to read this book.	1
Art of War is an ancient Chinese text on the practice of warfare, both physical and psychological. While much of the treatise is metaphorical in expression, with a little critical thinking the axioms of warfare are true in many aspects of life. This edition includes many annotations which relate the expressions to other Chinese texts on martial activities and commentaries on the manuscript itself, which can be helpful in understanding the metaphors. When reading, one should bear in mind that while the text particularly relates to warfare, the values which are promulgated therein can be readily applied to principles of business, multiple levels of security, and personal life.	1
A very abridged version of the writings. Lots of lists of the key points. Good as a quick reference but not the fully written out philosophy.  Sort of the "Cliff Notes" version, not that makes it bad.	1
Sunzi was renowned for his battle strategies and philosophies. His writing are among the classics of must read art of warfare around today regardless of how many thousands of years old it may be. This book provide readers with the understanding of war, how to attack and enemy and how to defeat an enemy. I am a warrior at heart and in practice I work in a field of enforcement so knowing my enemy and well as knowing myself is a real philosophy. Keep my friends close and my enemies closer another aspect of this war masters doctrine.	1
Don’t let the 1 star reviews scare you. This is the complete addition. Sun tzu wrote on chop sticks so it is written like little words of wisdom. It’s not a traditional book that is going to teach you how to win a war. If the reader is looking for wisdom, you will find wisdom in this book.	1
Review is for this edition, which is made to order. Several typos and spacing issues. The translation leaves a bit to be desired, but since theres not a lot of printing info its hard to that being said. It was produced professionally at a notably low price for a new book.  Was a superior reading experience than printing the text offline and reading that way. Recommended for anyone who wants to bust through a common classic text. For me its a primer for pursuing an older edition.	1
This book is OK.  Font is large enough and reading is easy.  I guess I got spoiled because I had a different version of the book with Samuel B. Griffith, but gave it away a few years back in a "purge" of my shelves.  I shouldn't have let that one go:  it's a gem.  All you get with this one is the bare-bones translation of the script. It is, however, much less expensive.  I am glad I read the other book I mentioned with the background material and analysis.  The original script is an ancient writing, in Chinese, and a little difficult to understand without some background or comment.  I suggest that if you want to understand the meanings of Sun Tzu more fully, buy the other book.	1
I've been reading and re-reading The Art of War for several years! I can see I will continue to read it over and over. So much to learn in a way you can't forget it	1
I wish this book was longer. I only feel kind of prepared for war. If Sun Tzu put more effort into writing this book, I might be better suited for wars. It was still a good purchase though. No regerts. 5 stars. Must read. NY Times bestseller fo sho.	1
as all the top reviews state, this is not a full text of the Art of War, and the advertising is extremely misleading in this sense. Who would order a book just to read a summary? I managed to cancel my purchase, but I am confused about how the average review appears to be 4+ stars, yet all the reviews I am reading are one star, and the positive reviews are just people saying how much they love the Art of War, not mentioning this specific product. Very misleading.	0
The book arrived sooner than expected so was able to add it to the birthday gifts for the 8 year old grandson. Since he is all about playing with military toys and mounting pretend battles. This will be a great  addition to the basic principles he'll learn from the  BABY (which is really fine for kids to age 10 or so) version of The Art of War which he can read and understand now.	1
Not the full book! Very misleading as this book appears to have carried over the reviews from the actual book. This one is literally 27 pages.	0
This is a review for the Kindle edition, which is formatted perfectly well with the lists and punctuation all in place and the illustrations coming out viewable and intelligible on both my iPad and Kindle Touch (1st gen). Sun Tzu's Art of War is a timeless classic with much of its philosophy still applicable, if not all of its strategies, as geography is not much an issue in modern warfare, although many are still disturbingly accurate against the tests of time. This is a must have for every Kindle-owner and is something everyone should read once in their lives.	1
Written centuries ago, this book is the general guide for every situation we will encounter in life; not only at war. In simple words it will show you why so many military campaigns have failed such as Vietnam or to be more current the war on the Middle East, which is drying our economy dry (besides the housing market crash). Actually, think of the Art of War, as the art of fighting everyday challenges and our personal wars and conflicts. Every person in the government, every teacher, every student, every household must read this book and keep it close as a reference whenever we don't know how to proceed with difficult decisions or challenges.	1
not the whole book and does not tell you thats its not the full book	0
Wow! This is not only about war, but you can apply this to almost any endeavor and learn how to win consistently. It teaches you that winning is mostly about preparation, planning, teamwork, and above all, knowing both yourself and your opponent. It does not just say these things, it also tells you the how and the why, with examples.  Be aware this is a translation from ancient Chinese, so the translator has inserted notes about the difficulty of translating the true meaning of certain passages.  However, in all he does a great job.  This is the book that ALL great generals have read. Charge on!	1
This book is not only a great read about military strategies but about how to keep house in your life and business.	1
This is NOT the version of ART OF WAR that most people are searching for.  Perhaps Amazon should include a page count in the description.  This version is more like a pamphlet with a glossy cover.  The information is very simple translation of military strategy taken from ancient text.  Nothing contained in these pages pertain to the life of a modern day person.  If that's what you are seeking...find a different version.	0
Flipping through it I glean bits and pieces of an organized mind. I can easily understand why this book has existed for more than 2000 years. My intention is to read it a little at a time so that I absorb some of the philosophy. I am not interested in war but I am interested I how men think and plan, this should be an excellent guidebook.	1
I have managed to wear out several printed copies of Sun Tzu over the years. While the book IS about war--about forming and implementing strategies, and drawn from real life experience, Sun Tzu's lessons can be applied effectively in any life situation involving 2 or more people--the more adversarial, the better LOL. Sun Tzu has stood by me through thick and thin--his sage advice has made a big difference in my personal approach to business deals, handling employees, dealing with various professionals from a subservient position--even dealing with pushy doctors and controlling ex spouses. Sun Tzu is about LIFE. Because like it or not, life isn't fair, it isn't always fun, and some times--you need to be able to be assertive without being aggressive, and you have to be willing to be adversarial to get what you need. This is a worthwhile read for ANYONE--both from an advice and tactics point of view, AND for the clarity of style, turn of phrase, and excellent use of metaphor. I have yet to run into a BAD translation of Tzu, and this one was no exception.	1
This is considered a long time classic.  Rightfully so.  It is a book with many interpretations and you will take away the ones you see as useful to your situation.  That being said more of the concepts may apply.  Sun Tzu wrote this book about matters he considered serious so even being a short book by today's standards it applies to important matters (it is read and studied a most major military higher training facilities the world over.)  The applications are not just military but can be applied to any situation where there is a conflict between two entities.	1
I downloaded this book for my son.  He is a gamer.  He thought it would help him and he is constantly testing lessons learned.  I think this is an awesome book for kids that can't stay away from a gaming console for more than a few minutes.  I wish there were more books that could get my kids to read voluntarily.	1
My bad for not reading the description... this thing is just a little pamphlet buddy to the actual real version that i see that i still need to buy... 5$ for this...not even worth the price of return shipping.lol. whatever...	0
I like the thin profile of this book, it's got nice thicker pages and doesn't get all bent up in the corners. The content is legendary and will give you insight to anything you do in life, work, or play.	1
Cheap and quick in it's arrival. Now for the book you should read it as there is some advice that applies to everyone even if they aren't competing or going to war.	1
A book of war strategy -- "The Art of War", which was written in China 2,500 years ago, by the Chinese General SUN TZU. I was introduced to this book in martial arts studies and later was again introduced to the book in business as a tool for planning business strategy. Examples Know the Enemy This is the first of SUN TZU's rules for successful warfare. Know Yourself The second part of SUN TZU's rule is to know yourself-- strengths and weaknesses Presented this book to business friends and martial artist. Have two hardback and this Kindle Copy--- enjoy......cas	1
Should have seen the number of pages mentioned in the description.  It's not a full book,  it's a summary.  How deceptive!!!	0
I should have read the reviews before I got this. I am the only one to blame. Don't buy this expecting the big book. 👎	0
This short book takes a primer approach to being a general and leader in "war".  I can't see how it would be an essential element of turning anyone into a successful general.  You can learn most of the basic lessons presented by Sun Tzu by playing "war" or "cowboys & indians" in the mountains of Pennsylvania.  If you had a deprived childhood (your Mom & Dad kept guns away from you and did not allow you to play "violent" childhood games), I recommend you read the book and pay attention to basic tactics and the value of planning and using all available resources.  Because it is short and instructional it should be a quick read and worth your time (even if you read it only to satisfy your curiosity).  I was a bit disappointed, given the hype of the book.  The general repeats himself and often makes a big deal of the obvious. If you want to become the next General Macarthur or General Patton, make better use of your time and look elsewhere.  If you think there is a need for another Napolean type, then maybe this would be a good start.  If you are still curious, have the time, & a couple of bucks, buy it and read it.	1
I should've read product description before buying I would've found that the book here is 60 pages and just a gist of the original, wouldn't recommend buying	0
This book is a good tool for former and present leaders. No matter the environment whether in a business or any other functional set up, like hospitals, profit and non profit organizations, private or public industry, war is everywhere and is always restless.	1
The ideas presented in Sun Tzu's Art of War are still applicable to the 21st century.  Reading Sun Tzu's words can open your mind to what life presents to us on a daily basis.  Taking that statement one step further - we have to become cognizant to our surroundings. environment and the people in our circle of friends or colleagues at work.  Rereading the Art of War will give you a deeper insight and understanding of the meaning behind the words.  Once you open yourself - many things only become clear.  You might say - food for thought.	1
Great book,  however the formatting of this version is terrible.  The first 300 pages are unorganized and poorly written analyses of the art of War.  Moreover, this version is devoid of the fancy bells and whistles features in other e-books such as; a table of contents, hyperlinks,  etc. If you'd like to get to the actual Sun Tzu text open this ebook and do a search on your kindle for "I.  Laying " without the quotation marks. Other than the aforementioned problems this is an exact replica of the Giles translation of the art of War. (you get what you pay for)	1
Because of the illustrations I downloaded The Art of War to the Kindle Fire HD.  Quite pleased with the presentation and the formatting. As for the text of the book itself, there is little that can be said that has not been said.  This is a must read book for everyone, and I especially recommend it for late teens or college students.  Although Sun Tzu was actually describing war, this book is easily understood in terms of life in general and great for business majors.	1
If you are in politics, business or the military you will find the thoughts of General Sun Tzu quite enlightening and useful in strategy and tactics.  The unfortunate thing for military folks is that "civilians" and generals in a building thousands of miles away from the danger have far too much say in the actions on the battlefield and reveal that they obviously have no knowledge of General Tzu's teachings, which if employed could save lives and shorten wars. A quick and easy read at a reasonable price.	1
I was glad to finally read this book, however I was burdened with so much history and "back-story" as to who Sunzi was, if in fact he existed.  There seemed to be about 33% of the book in setting up of who Sunzi was before we read his first line of teachings. It is great to read his teachings, but all the setup seems unnecessary and somewhat irritating.  I already had a pretty good idea about Sunzi and strictly wanted to read his teachings.  I think, in short, his teachings could be written in a handful of pages and one could interpret from there, but that is not the case with this version. I would still recommend this friends and family, but it would come with a strong warning about the setup and the seemingly constant commentary, which distracted me from really enjoying his teachings.	1
So... Just so you know. Remember, anyone can review any product on Amazon, and for the most part few actually review the product itself. This particular eBook is thick with in-depth information on Art of War and its author. It takes about 3 chapters to even begin to reach the chapter. First a discussion of Sun Tsu's existence, then of the books existence, then of the 13 critics that will be interjected as you read the book. And the interjections don't wait till the end or are footnoted, they're put wherever and however long need be. It's not bad, in fact, it's really informative; but I just wanted the 13 chapters. If you think you'd be apply to just push through the square bracket passages be ready for a real challenge. I'd want to rate it 1 to offset the other ratings but this 'edition' isn't that bad, just not what was expected.	1
I took the course a long time ago.  This is THE BEST synopsis I have come across.  If you study this little book it will open almost any door for you and allow you to WIN easily.  It may be applied to business, sports and personally if you follow the principles set forth in this easy to read and understand strategy.	1
Reads like a long series of sometimes insightful and sequential, topically organized fortune cookies on the art of war. Still going thru it. Not exactly a book you can't put down.	1
Easy to read Great content Highly recommended. Can use these strategies at modern workplaces	1
This is the book people leaving the comfort of home to go into the real world.  This book is where military and industry management education begins the world over. Redundant but also if you read about the time frame and the history of that part of the world you will see how well the idea works. This book illustrates how going forward is done if getting the job done is all that matters.  If you also read books on world leaders and military leaders you will see how they applied the process.	1
the book was in good condition and a nice price to boot. it came in a timely fashion as well	1
Didn’t realize it came in two books. No big deal at all!	1
The narration for Sun Tzu's Art of War by Tantor Abridged is excellent. It does more than justice to the original novel, and even provides side notes of interesting commentary by other historically significant characters (generals, warlords and others who have noted on the word of Sun Tzu) and even accounts of real battle applications. Definitely worth the price. I enjoyed every minute of this work, and even as a less-than-avid reader, it was a very enjoyable experience.	1
Not the full length book. This shouldn’t have 4.5 stars at all	0
It's amazing to think that someone so long ago, without the access to study legions of greats before him could have so many practical ideas that would truly stand the test of time (referring to the fact that he would become one of the greats and was born before major "peers" in Europe or elsewhere would even be born). What some say about being able to use his ideas in other areas, like business, is a legitimate claim, as the ideas are about beating an enemy, not specifically about how to win a war on th  battlefield. Must-read for any student of history, military or otherwise, and those in the business world wanting to learn a couple tricks to get a leg-up.	1
thought I was getting the Thomas Cleary Edition.  Nope.  Not happy.	0
The book Art of War written by Sun Tzu is military treasure trove of military tactics.  This is a stunning display of 13 chapters that were written over 2500 years.  The chapters in this book describe one of the world's greatest general's philosophy on war and strategy. The book discusses different ways to command troops and the pitfalls associated with war.  Sun Tsu states that the faster your troops move, the more troops are lost in the process.  The author's philosophy here is to show that more careful planning to military strategy will save lives and hopefully achieve success on the battlefield. The Art of War can be applied to life in general and not just military tactics.  Taking one's time in planning will lead to less strife, fewer problems, and reaching one's goals.  This book is a great read for anyone interested in military strategy and philosophy.  I highly recommend it!	1
this is a great handbook to own, it will teach you the importance of how and when to fight your battles, but more importantly..how to pick the ones you want to fight. you will know the difference. and if you follow these simple guidelines, you will succeed.	1
This is a great book on Chinese history and the basic principles to the strategy of war. It is the words of the great general Sun Tzu from the Warring States Period in ancient China (around 400b.c.). This is particular edition is very clear and precise, however short. It is the bare basics and a great intro to other higher level editions, as well as books on warfare. I would recommend reading every line over until you grasp what Sun Tzu was trying to say. I would also think it beneficial if you followed up reading a more through edition, perhaps the 2005 hard cover edition of The Illustrated Art of War by Samuel Griffith, followed by The Art of Warfare by Sun Tzu's descendant Sun Pin (Sun Bin). In short, this is a great, easy to learn, piece of Chinese literature that is a great intro to the philosophy of warfare which can be applied to everyday life and leadership.	1
Don't buy. Wish i read a single review before buying. Didn't think I'd have to check the reviews to know if this was the right book. Cliff notes version but doesn't state that anywhere.	0
This crap is the equivalent to a high schooler book report based on a YouTube video of someone paraphrasing the book from memory. Amazon should be ashamed to sell this crap. And the cost to ship it back is more than I paid for it.	0
Sun Tzu's maxims and insights are timeless.  Centuries after it was written, The Art of War is required reading for warriors and still taught as part of the central curriculum at military academies around the world.  The insights are timeless, on point, focused, and delivered with a no-nonsense clarity that translates to tactical and operational success.  It is a must read for any serious student of warfare and history, for every soldier, and for those that wish to understand them.	1
Looks and feels like a school notebook. Bad quality.	0
Good for a short version  Chapter 9 was missing from my copy.	0
This version is the 12 chapters without the lengthy introductions.	1
When you interpret what is said it all makes sense. I did a quick read and then went back and re-read will be a great reference book. You could use the information in war or business it's all in how you use it	1
Book looks cheaply made, but it also is super cheap, so no surprise there. It’s free online, I should have probably just done that.	1
Quality and translation are reasonable, I think. There's one chapter out of order, which is certainly a mistake and weird, but not super bad. No prologue, no epilogue: nothing but the main text and index. All in all, for the $4 I paid for it, pretty OK.	1
This book contains only Sun Tzu's original thoughts on war and does not have any comentary added about his observations.  It does not paraphrase or compare it to business models or any other inspirational theme.  I enjoyed the plain information and reading this man's observations and deductions about how to win a war was very interesting and gave me lots of insights into humans and war. Quite recommended just for the concepts provided.	1
A great reference book! Would recommend.	1
A book everyone must read at least once in their life. A great teaching of life, business, and self.	1
There are works that you must read or cannot consider yourself as educated.  this is one of those authors who has been translated many times into almost every language, so weather this translation or others, the author Sun Tzu or Sunzi, however you pronounce the ideogram;  produced in a few chapters one of the seminal works on conflict and one of the oldest works on the subject that is as relevant today as it was when it was written.	1
Normal Quality for paperback. I would recommend to purchase Art of War with experts comments on them	1
this book is a steal i dont care about the negative reviews talking about editions and nitpicking and what not this is a great price and also the best looking cover to any art of war book out there simplistic and impacting very appealing and at a very veryyy affordable price i havent read it yet but i know what to expect i suggest buying it you really have nothing to lose	1
This is only the summary, not the actual book.	0
Appears to be the same version that appears under multiple different entries when you search for 'The Art of War' on Amazon. Doesn't appear to be full text and there are noticeable typos (note heading numbered '5, 6' under 'Laying Plans' - if you scroll through you'll see this in numerous versions of the book on the Amazon results).	0
The book is solid. I can see why so many people recommend reading it. There are a lot of basic points, but it is nice to see from such a point of view. I received and read this book all in one day. It is not very long.	1
This is my first time purchasing The Art of War by Sun Tzu, but realize now that I should have read the reviews first!  Great price, but wasn't expecting Cliff notes version of the book.  On the flip side of that, I can't say I'm terribly dissatisfied because I'm sure I'll enjoy the knowledge it offers.  Although, next time I'll be sure to read reviews first!	1
While this book deals with the subject of war, it may be aplicable to daily life and business. Of course with regard to life and business the goal must be to prevail without brutality and killing. This book also showes that war should always be a last option because once engaged it must be fought with all the brutality man can concieve. Simply put don't go to war unless you mean to prevail. If you engage you must be prepaired to do all that is necessary to win. A must read for our polititians! Not an easy read.	1
The Art of War is a compendium of the military experience and wisdom of Sun Tzu, which is an honorific given to the author, Sun Wu. It was written over two millennium ago. Naturally there are varying theories and disputes as to who actually wrote it, and which version is correct. There is also the matter of the proper translation. The one I read was translated by Lionel Giles in 1910. It is one of the most, if not the most influential text on military strategy and tactics. Mao Zedong, Vo Nguyen Giap and Douglas MacArthur are only three of the many military leaders who credit the importance of Sun Tzu work in guiding their thinking. It remains an essential "textbook" at the military colleges in the United States, and is also required reading in the CIA. I finally decided to read this classic in search of a specific quote that I had been told was from Sun Tzu's work, and which I had had some personal experience with: "Never fight on a battlefield that resembles an inverted tortoise shell."  I didn't find the quote, but perhaps I found the opposite. At least the tortoise shell reference SOUNDS like something he might have said. The author did grab my attention with an anecdote in the introduction which underscored one of his aphorisms: "If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders are clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers." In the anecdote, it is women who are divided into two sides, each led by one of the emperor's favorite concubines. Because they could not maintain proper discipline among their "troops," each of the concubines is beheaded, despite the protests of the emperor. It should be no surprise that their replacements achieved perfect discipline within the ranks, and Sun Tzu, who proclaimed the army ready, had the temerity to rebuke the emperor with: "The King is only fond of words, and cannot translate them into deeds." (How often such a speaker, in the real world, can keep his own head is not discussed in the text.) There is much wisdom in this text. For example: "All warfare is based on deception." "There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare." On a good leader: "Hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilize combined energy." And one that Vo Nguyen Giap must have taken to heart: "Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances." (that is, he did not repeat the tactics that led to victory at Dien Binh Phu by repeating them at Khe Sanh; instead he went for Saigon, and the American public via television) As for that "inverted tortoise shell," the one passage that seemed closest to addressing this issue seemed to imply the opposite: "Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys." And, "Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare." (Certainly Giap seemed to have disregarded that one). And there seems to be that "classic problem" of all too many "holy" books. There are passages that imply "this", and passages that imply the opposite of "this."  For example, on the all-important matter of logistics and supply, Sun Tzu says:  "Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy," and "Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own."  But on the other hand: "We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost, without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost." There is much good advice that seems to be routinely ignored, despite its place in the curriculum, such as the emphasis on short, decisive wars and the repeated admonitions to know the enemy. Conversely, there are the passages that can be chosen to buttress one argument, and others to buttress the counter-argument. Overall, 4-stars.	1
This is not what you are looking for. (68 total pages) More akin to a booklet, you're better off finding a free pdf version than paying money for this overblown brochure	0
This book is an easy read for me and the book is very interesting.	1
Seriously simple read that will help you whether the need arises to lay siege to a walled city or the normal day to day confrontations we all have.  It's really a book of proverbs on who is likely to win a battle and why.  Whatever those battles are.	1
Only a 3 start because the book looks bigger in the pictures lol but meh it's nice	1
This is more a historians review of various works related to Sunzi. The first few parts are interesting, while latter parts of the book goes flat latter on with lines of wisdom, wit, and paragraphs trying to give meaning and intelligence to those lines.	1
If you are in to this type of book... highly recommended! Shipped and received quickly too.	1
I got this for my husband and he really enjoyed reading it. It is exactly what the title says it is. It's a classic and that is why my husband wanted it. The price on this book is great. It a nice binding for as inexpensive as it is. If you are looking for a short classic about ancient war strategies this book will fit that need.	1
A terrible condensed version. It reads like a college student's study notes.	0
This book is a fine distillation of skill gleaned from vast experience on the field of battle. Much of the instruction revolves around actually avoiding battle and the carnage of war. It has become an inspiration and map for building strategy in managing people. It seems to me when words passed down through many generations remain relevant, those words have attained greatness.	1
words to live by in this cut throat corporate world, as well as every day dealings with the people around us,Never be taken advantage of,Always have the upper hand,be in a position of command & control. General Sun Tzu is a visionary way ahead of his time !	1
Sun Tzu and "The Art of War," is a must read for any person who battles. If you know someone you call friend who has not read "The Art of War." it is your duty to get them a copy of the book. There is more to a fight than the fist or weapon. It all starts in the mind of one or more beings. An ancient lesson; uncontrolled anger against a real or imagined enemy is what will destroy us long before the foe.	1
It's an abridged version	0
Not the full length book. Nothing in the description says this is a short summary of the actual book. Very disappointed	0
Short about 60 pages  with various saying from sun tzu	1
This is not the book. I thought it was the book.	0
Worked as a gag gift for a friend, but wasn't nearly the whole works of the Art of War. Don't buy this.	0
The translation in this copy is awful, but shame on me for purchasing a $3 copy. There are instances when the publisher fails to translate the Chinese, and instead includes the phonetic spelling of the Chinese character. I think that ought to give you a flavor for how this reads. Terrible.	0
This is easily the best book on strategy and war that I have.  The format is good enough for me.  A must have in every collection.	1
Great read i enjoyed this book	1
Shipped quickly and arrived in perfect shape.	1
One of the best books for anyone to read for almost any reason. The Art of War has many teachings and life lessons for every single person that only can aid in your journey through life.	1
This is a great "pocket" version of "The Art of War"- there are no notes or additional interpretations, so it is not a scholarly study of the text, it is simply Sun Tzu's words in one compact document.	1
I have listened to this book on audible but I did purchase this book just for reference. This book is a powerful book!	1
We as humans have been killing each other for centuries... The author just refined the process of how to best do it in his time... Well done.	1
Arrived on time in perfect condition. I only gave the product four stars because its a very thin book in person. I always thought that it was thicker, like a novel. This version is quite thin and seems like a book of lists of Sun Tzu's teachings. I bought this book so I could have a copy of my own, even though my dad has one. His is much more novel-like. Maybe one is revised or rewritten or something, but I wish I knew if this one is truly authentic, not revised.	1
One of the classic treatises on managing ultimate human conflict. You don't read this for entertainment. But if you are in any way involved in a battleground, whether it's on a real battlefield with real weapons, or in an office with only words and deeds as your weapons, you'll learn more about how to prevail.	1
This is someone's interoperation  of the text I wanted a Complete translation DELETED from Kindle!!	0
I think everyone in general should read this book. Great book for understanding war strategy and can definitely be applied to everyday life.	1
I had heard of the book for decades, but as part of a political strategy group was required to read it.  While I strongly believe in the virtues and power of Love and Forgiveness, in nearly every endeavour it is important to know whom you may be working for or against.  In politics, being prepared and understanding your opponents weaknesses is vital.  This is a short book and packed with wisdom.	1
Whether you like learning or prepping for the end of days, this book is a treasure worthy sharing through the ages.	1
Good product.	1
Read this book and it changed my live in 2013! Bought it because I read it from the Library! Taoism and eastern philosophy has the greatest approach to the battle within!	1
It would be foolish for someone to claim superior knowledge over the author of this treatise of tactics and wisdom in the Art of War. Sun Tsu has been studied for centuries now and to date there has been no one that has been able to best perhaps the move brilliant tactician of all time. Though the book is relatively short, within it's pages is a treasure trove of knowledge IF the reader can and will apply the lessons of this Master of all things War.	1
This guy was light years ahead of his time. His battles depended on mostly tactics based on what the weather conditions were, and what form of territory and environment you're in, and to ration your army's energy during a battle, and when to fight and when not to.  (It's a damn good thing that Hitler didn't do his homework on this.) And basically show that the rules of war is, was, and always will be, BS. His tactics are still put to good use even to this very day, thou it's original intention was for future wars, but it's put into practice for other means. For instance, football coaches, company managers, even the great Bobby Fisher took a  few tips from this guy's book. So in retrospect, technology and engineering may have completely obliterated the dynamics of the rules of war, but the art is still the same.	1
While this is a treaties, and not a novel like the Amazon prompts treats it; it should be said that Sunzi or Tsun Zu depending on the translation, is an extremely complex and pragmatic writer. His views on war influenced all the great leaders of the last 300 years and I would wager that it would be the last 1000 years (but I couldn't prove it).	1
This book has been around for 1000 years. It's on everybody's Must Read list.	1
How about putting in the details that’s it’s not the full text. What a scam.	0
A classic of strategy for approaching difficult decisions. Also helps explain some parts of Chinese thinking of strategy.	1
Not the full length	0
I like it; straight to the point. It explains the aspects of war and how to apply tactics! Some information can be applied to everyday life.	1
Wonderful book. Clean covert. Came quickly with no issues. Highly recommend this read	1
It was a dollar. Why not	1
A classic to read, cheap to pick up, and printed nicely in this book.	1
I read this over the weekend and I found it very though provoking. Several of the laws made me think about current affairs. Perhaps our leaders should read it.	1
I liked this book must read	1
Must read. It’s helped me in my profesional life, a lot.	1
When I first sought out this book I did so because it seems to be everywhere. Everyone seems to have either read it or knows someone very close who has. It is in several movies and television shows; the list goes on. So I told myself, "I need to read this just to see what it is," and when it arrived I was surprised. The book is incredibly smaller than I would have ever predicted, but this is not to say it is void of content. It seems to me to have been written in such a way as to avoid any irrelevant information. Without quoting or divulging its 'secrets,' The Art of War is a unique tool for looking into the strategic mind of the past, and for improving/refining/solidifying your own theory.	1
This book is a treasure Everyone should read it	1
Mostly common sense but still worth the read!	1
Excellent book if you like poignant summaries from one of the world’s greatest tacticians. I gave it to my son for his 13th birthday and he loves it.	1
Best book out there for your private and professional life.I cannot  be as ruthless but I can spot a ruthless person.  this book taght me how to deal with them and not become one of them.  A must read for any female	1
I purchased this book because I wore out my 1st one. Love the book.	1
Good Book	1
The book is smaller than I expected, in that it feels like a children's book in my hands.  It's well made, but if you're expecting a full size book, don't order this one!	1
Interesting book. I know it's a classic and wanted to find out what made it such. A lot of sound basic common-sense ideas about how a war should be fought, but overall it wasn't the inspiration I expected. But worth a read.	1
Read for the 7th time. Sun Tzu's Art of War is one of those world's finest classic literatures that marks and influences those who will challenge themselves to read this military treatise. It discusses tactics and strategies in military affairs, that are implicitly related and indirectly applied to the fields of business affairs, human psychology, management, ancient history, military sciences, politics, anatomy of organizations in conflicts, and the likes. Classics remain classics not because they were written in the ancient times; they were called classics because they continue to have meanings - different meanings when read in different circumstances and moods. They become more useful as we use them, therefore we grow wiser with them. Understanding Sun Tzu's treatise is understanding ancient methods of resolving conflicts, handling battles, and hailing to the great spiritual tradition of Taoism.	1
Every survival expert, and survivalist should have a copy of this book in their bunker. The principals of supply, transportation, and victory are contained in the pages of this book.  While translated to modern language, the essence is clear that the Art of War is an old profession, but if followed and adhered to, will allow anyone the chance for final victory.	1
Easy read for history and military people	1
Don’t waste your time buying this; you won’t find much that’s relevant for today.  Even if you are a military person, the info in this is for centuries gone by.	0
A must read for anyone interested in warfare and how it is waged.  How battles are won and lost.  Highlights the importance of intelligence.  What Sunzi wrote so long ago holds true for today's warriors.	1
Great new	1
the bible of war. literally. there's the bible, a treatise on which the foundations of man's quest for faith is built, and the art of war, the manual for defeating your enemy yet securing your place at God's feet as the meek who will inherit the earth. Defeating your enemy before the battle ensues, and is so much applicable today as it was 2000 years ago when it was written ( i might be off by a year or 2)	1
So this is more like a notes book, not the actual book. Has a good summary of your trying to write a paper. Maybe I didn’t read the discription correctly.	0
Exactly what it says it is.	1
Tons of important typos and poor translations	0
Quick read it’s great	1
Confusing, does not appear to be the full version.	0
I got this in great condition. I enjoyed reading this and learning about how significant this writing has been in ancient times and in modern times. I had this delivered in a timely manner too.	1
This book was recommended to me by none other than Greg Berhrendt via his former podcast Walking The Room. I love it so much! It’s so different than what I was expecting in a great way! Thanks Greg!	1
I was wondering what the BIG DEAL of this book was. Many business people have read it and address it as a business book. I found it free on amazon and of course, I downloaded it. Boy! Am I glad I did. The beginning was a bit scary for me. Let me not spoil it for you, but if you read it, you will understand why. For those on business, get this right: if the vision and mission of the organization are clear, but the members or employees are not acting accordingly, the leadership is to blame, and MUST be FIRED, or maybe worse...	1
I very much loved the transcriptions of Sun Tzu, and the design of the book and format was appealing. However, there were some translation issues (which were mildly excusable and expected), but there were also some punctuation issues. This is a very fascinating read, and the few flaws this version has are excusable for the cheap price of 4.00$.	1
I'll start off by saying that this Kindle version has quite a few typos, which is the only reason I granted it 4 stars. The book itself, however, deserves 5 stars. Although it was written for an entirely different era, it's still modernly applicable in the art of strategic thinking. In addition, being someone who is fond of lists, I loved the writing style of the book. It was short, sweet, and didn't waste any time getting right to the point.	1
There's like 100s of editions of the Art of War!  It's difficult to figure out which ones are 'legit'.  My particular edition (yellow book with red and black yin yang) was one of the fakes.	0
This book rips.	1
Nowhere does it say it's the footnotes version of the book. It's condensed down to 60 pages of proverbs with context taken out.	0
Iwas a little disappointed when I opened this book. This is not one of the better published translations that are available, however, taking into account the purchase price, I will just add it to my library as a variant copy.	1
The product description is misleading as it doesn’t mention that this isn’t the ACTUAL book. This version does not contain full text. Look elsewhere if you want to purchase The Art of War. It was my mistake for not being more wary of the low price and not looking into the page count.	0
Misspelled words, grammatical errors and difficult layout  abound in the kindle edition.  Very distracting.	1
If you never read another book, read this!	1
This is a classic book that I heard about and wanted to read.  It's a very interesting book with interesting principles and strategies.	1
Great	1
The book is short but interesting. It's written in the style of bullet points. It's not hugely practical for today's times, but it is very interesting to see the wisdom of someone from 1,500 years ago and the guidance they gave to deal with war in their time.	1
There is so much interesting information in this small book, and it is such a good guide to strategy. The strategies can be extrapolated to help in problem-solving, although we are not always at war, of course. It is a great thought-provoking text for dealing with difficult situations and finding out-of-the-box solutions. It encourages creative solutions.	1
This is a wonderful book, it is about so much more than war...it's really about life and people. I highly recommend it to anyone that deals with people, that want a new understanding of the world and how people fit within it.	1
Having heard so much about Sun Tzu and his wisdom, I was prepared for something much better.  His writing might impress someone with no experience in the field, but for those who have a general knowledge of the outdoors and warfare, it is not very enlightening. What makes it particularly disappointing to me is the fact that he contradicts himself so many times.  It would seem that the whole idea is to impress people with his wisdom rather than actually impart anything of any real value. There is some good advice, but nothing that is much above the common sense of an American Eagle Scout and most of the successes are simply the result of deception and ruthlessness. Something that is repeated several times is the fact that trying to fight a war in faraway places can be very expensive and difficult.  Considering the fiascoes of Korea and Vietnam, we should already know this by bitter experience!  So other than a few examples of deception and trickery, I really did not see a lot of military expertise in his accomplishments. One of the things that I disliked the most about the book, was that it is printed in a font so small that it is very hard on the eyes.  All in all, I don't feel the book was worth the small price I paid for it.	0
A concise book filled with timeless insight regarding both war and life.	1
It's only around 60 pages. It doesn't indicate that anywhere. Don't buying you want the full version.	0
Always...	1
Wtf!? Short version summary. nowhere in the description does it say it's a cliff note of the actual book.	0
Great accompaniment when learning to play chess.	1
The Art of WAR IS A QUICK READ BUT A MORE DIFFICULT STUDY. MY GOAL WAS TO FIND PARALLELS IN THE BOOK THAT I COULD RELATE TO BUSINESS AND PLEASURE. I FIND MYSELF REREADING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TO SEE IF THERE IS A STRATEGY TO A CURRENT LIFE CHALLENGE. SOMETIMES THERE IS, MORE OFTEN I DO NOT FIND THE STRATEGY. THAT IS WHEN I USE TRUE LIFE EXPERIENCES. I WILL MOST LIKELY READ IT SEVER MORE TIMES DURING THE COMING YEAR.	1
Love it	1
book	1
This book is one that you read over and over.  Always some new comes to light as you reread.  Should be on a need to read list at college level and a must for all military people.	1
first off. it is VERY thin and not a long read. it's not quite the "philosophical masterpiece" i thought it would be. it was still an interesting read with SOME interesting points. i believe that Sun Tzus views are more mainstream in asia, but to me(an american) they didn't quite click. Buy it if you would like to see different view points of a collectivist culture, it was an interesting read.	1
An interesting read.	1
Great price and a perfect stocking stuffer🌲	1
It's one of those books you have to read. Sure, it's been summarized a thousand times, interpreted in a thousand ways, and twisted around in quotes forever, but it's one of those things that, until you've read it, it just doesn't come together like it should. Read it, and maybe you'll learn something about yourself.	1
I have always enjoyed this reading.	1
This version is cheap for a reason. More like a summary of the original, but not at all what I was looking for. Maybe it is good as a summary but as the whole thing and a beautiful edition to a collection, it fails entirely.	1
price attractive but no translator specified, nor any info beyond the text itself.	0
You will be surprised how much pure horse crap you'll begin seeing in people once you've read this book. Essential tool for life; especially in the workplace.	1
This book looks like someone printed it at home. And maybe they did. The cover is blurred/pixelated so it looks like someone stretched out a low-res image and sent it through their inkjet. There's no publisher information inside either. Anyway, nice simplified version of The Art of War if that's what you're looking for.	1
This version is trash.	0
Some of the principles were solid and others were a bit over the top. A decent read nonetheless though.	1
Just my curious about china.	1
This is a low quality, EXTREMELY abridged version with so few pages I probably could have written it myself in 2-3 hours. You'd think if they're advertising a well-known book but selling a version with only 20% of the content that they'd at least make an ATTEMPT at mentioning that.	0
Deceptice sales tactics. Do not buy this. This is barley a cliff note version of a long and profound book. Very disappointed. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!	0
Like most of the other reviewers, this book is a condensed version of the original book. I am highly disappointed and will be returning immediately, where upon I will purchase the original version.	0
Book was new and as advertised.	1
Very handy book when needed...perfect condition.	1
Good short and sweet, no bull no nonsense blah blah. just the facts. Easy to remember rather than the other versions I have owned. Those had too much comments from translators and they put thier own twist on what Sun Tsu ,meant. This version gets to the point, not meant for the scholar, meant for regular guys like me.	1
Already a classic hit for this ancient war strategy book that still benefit this generation, Adian's voice was perfect narrative to explain and follow the cunning nation of war, its strategy and how a commander, or ruler should view the art of the craft. Already loving his performance as Littlefinger in Game of Thrones, this version of the Art of War became one of my obsessed possession to listen over and over, while getting deeply educated about this ancient strategy! Highly highly recommended for anyone who is GOT fan to get a copy! A Must have!	1
Thank you so much love it awsome condition👍	1
Always my favourite interpretation of Sun Tzu's Art of War. Most interpretation I have read are dry and dull to read. James Clavel captures the spirit and intent of Sun Tzu's masterpiece of strategy.	1
Handy book if your looking to improve leader skills in the job place. Good knowledge to have too	1
I can not speak intelligently about the quality of this translation.  Given the accuracy of translation / I found that this was a brilliant summary of tactics used in ground warfare in China several thousand years ago.  Still poignant today across battlefields.  It does not of course include ana/lysis of naval and air and ground technological advances.  Excellent reading and it comes highly recommended.	1
A classic that relates as much to business, negotiating, planning as to its original subject of war.	1
4/10 Review of the unabridged and unannotated Cleary translation; 97pp. Likely revolutionary when it was first written, the wisdom contained in this book is now 'old hat' common sense. The parts directly applicable to war, with few exceptions (such as 'know thy enemy and know thyself and fear no defeat') are exclusively applicable to 1st generation warfare, fought with sword, horse, bow, and static fortifications, though a few pages give a prècis of what should be expected of an officer corps and disciplined army which are applicable to any multi-tier centralized organization. The rest of the book is taken up with descriptions of terrain types, etc. with no modern practical nor metaphorical application that I could discern. (I wonder how many generals got their men slaughtered because they read this book and thought they understood war. Likely more than the mandarin system advanced to high government post on stylized understanding of the five classics and their commentaries.) Of the much-praised 'business strategy' or 'general strategy' or 'the art of war as life', I read little.	0
During the 1980s, in the wake of Reagan economics and greed on Wall Street, every tycoon wannabe read this book as a text for making money.  That isn't why Sun Zi wrote it.  He wrote it as a primary text for wannabe generals and military tacticians.  I suspect Erwin Rommel read it, the Desert Fox who kept the British Army at bay during his Afrika Campaign.  Written in the typical style of Chinese, short and succinct, it is a very great look at military tactics.	1
One of my favorite books	1
I had to read this. This book has been the basis for war strategy for centuries. It's very interesting, short, yet involved. It's translated so it's a bit rough in vernacular, but I would recommend this book for anyone that is in a cut-throat business, the military, or anyone looking to learn the strategy of defeating an opponent. You should read this if you haven't. This book is so important to the history of the world.	1
I GAVE ONE TO EACH OF ALL MY GRANDCHILDREN.	1
A great short read, the laws can be applied to not only warfare, but everyday life and any problems that may arise.	1
This book is not a promotion of violence, but is intended to help one gain an understanding of tactics and battle strategy. This english translation is very detailed and when displayed on Kindle unknown words are defined and easily understood. Also, transferrable to other devices when using an appropriate Kindle App.	1
Paperback copy	1
its a short description of a life of under expectations if you want to be under the influence of one teacher. Sun. If there are many levels which can't inform you to identify a level of victory.	0
The print was really small and it doesn't look like the original book pagination wise, I believe this is some kind of reprint.	1
Nice and compatible.	1
Quick to read and gives tons of ideas in any way shape or form. I used it to expand my strategies in business and it gave me so many ideas as to how to take down competition and win over others business. Nothing but excellence can come from this book!	1
Good book	1
Read a interpretation of this , the uninterpretated version is a little more intresting and fun to read.	1
Good book	1
This is not the full version of the book bit instead a cliff note or quick version. great for someone that needs a fast read for a paper or assignment but not for those that want to read the actual book.	0
Wasn't that interesting. The content was good, but overall wouldn't recommend. It seems like a lot of the information was outdated because the book references chariots and older methods of warfare. I would suggest thinking about the concepts in terms of modern warfare.	1
This is not the actual book but rather a version of the book broken down. I was looking for the original and this is not it, description is misleading. It works if you want a summary	1
This is a wonderful book, my son wants to be in the military and it helped him think about how they think about war. He had a hard time with the concepts at first but once he found the underlying meaning. he was able to read it with a breeze.	1
Classic book on thoughtful approach to life!	1
Not the full book	0
added to library	1
Perfect	1
Interesting tips for war. The old language was a little boring, may be because English is no't my native language.	1
Don’t buy not the full book.	0
Versus the Art of Peace. Good advice that is useful when enacting revenge upon others, or even driving down the highways.	1
Great book to read. A must to over come adversity in your life. Teaching you planning and how to win. Great for sports, professional life as well as personal.	1
Good book. Not archival quality.	1
Good book	1
Don't let the title deceive you. This book is not only for warfare on the battlefield but in your life. In some ways a fighting man's Tao Te Ching. Sunzu's classic prepares you for dealing with the cruel and duplicitous. I have read the book in Chinese and English and can confirm this is an excellent translation. It's funny how business people use the book when really they are just exercising their greed. The book is not about stealing but about gaining an advantage but always for the purpose of good and benefit of all. Over and over Sunzi discusses how the leader must consider their subordinates to achieve success. The story will remain useful throughout time.	1
Not the right Art of War	0
I was hoping it was the complete book.	0
Great	1
All members of the military and political/war theorists need to read this. It's a classic that introduces timeless concepts for how to wage war. It's up there with Carl von Clausewitz's On War in the annals of military theory writing.	1
Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese philosopher most of his sayings are still relevant to this day and age regarding business and warfare. I wish I can find my copy but it got lost in the midst of my stuff and probably thrown away since the book is very small. I might buy a second copy when I move out within two months so I can read it .	1
Though it may be the quintessential book for the military student and solider it's relevance can not be ignored. This book was written so long ago and in a language so difficult to translate its almost impossible to fully understand. That being said this version is very well done. The translations are done without embellishment with the commentary following each chapter. The basic principals of displine, organization, proper planing, intellengace, and even misdirection can be applied in may different fields of work. I highly recommend this book as an addition to anyone's personal library. You don't have to be a West Point cadet.	1
i love the way james clavell simplifies this very important book	1
This book is a must read on strategy for anything competition related.	1
As the title says, this book, and the ideas therein have truly stood the test of time. In any conflict, this book can aide you. I've even taken advice from this book and applied it in strategy games to much success. The concepts presented are flawless, logically speaking, and the book itself is well laid out.	1
Thank u	1
small but efficient	1
Way ahead of its time. Tactics have changed but the psychology of warfare is still the same. Must read for  the military.	1
While this is an interesting book, this edition is shoddily copy-edited. There are lots of typographical errors. You can read it for content but I'm a stickler for books using proper spellings so if I were to purchase again, I'd look for a cleaner edition.	1
Great book everyone needs to read	1
Rip off! This isn’t the entire book. Buyer beware! I was really excited to read this until it arrived, and I realized that this is a shortened version of the actual book.	0
thought i was buying the book, but this is like a little summary pamplet, very unhappy	0
It is very good and most of the principals hold true to today.	1
The book is a classic, so there's no comment on it (you should read other great reviews). But the edition is terrible. It even has the chapters in the wrong order! I mean, it was 3 dollars not 3 cents!	1
Has some really good advice that is generally limited to war/combat but not much else.  As a combat veteran I found it interesting, especially after having to work under senior officers for four years as a USAF pilot. Most couldn't find their butt with four hands.	1
A classic, but too basic if you have experience in military combat.  Very short book, you can finish it in a couple of hours.  A lot of stuff in this book is great for boxers to read.  More useful for training boxers than for modern military combat.  However, this is a very famous book.	1
This is a quick read, but the content is simple without much development. The basic ideas are clear, but the reasoning is not.	1
A book everyone should read! takes you to another way to look at life, work, and every thing in between. Written in a way that can be understand but takes a "higher mind" to really allow it to sink in. If you have an afternoon go through it and take it in, you'll look at the world in a different light and maybe you might even realize that you know a lot of this already but be open minded and take in everything it says  because The Art of War is something else! I highly recommend it, one of my favorites! fast shipping :)	1
The Art of War is a book of knowledge, the kind of knowledge that is timeless and a lifelong benefit to have learned.  If you haven't read this book and learned its teachings then you should and if you have read this book but not learned any life lessons then you need to go back and read it again until you grasp the knowledge you are holding in your hands.	1
Very important literature for these times!  The true nature of man’s Warfare.	1
I think a lot of people should read this book. Yeah, it is a book about military strategy, and most people don't need to know that or will ever need to know that. However, there is more to this book than meets the eye. This book also holds strategy one can use with interpersonal conflicts, business, and life in general. Simple ideas like flexibility, being prepared, and planning are all discussed in this book. I recommend it.	1
What can I say? Classic read. This has been used by corporate employees and managers to get a leg up on the competition through strategies of contention, confrontation, empowerment and 'going for the kill'. Recommend if you just want to learn battle strategies and applying their context into real world scenarios.	1
A large portion of the book is outdated. That being said there are tidbits of timeless information related to watergate, competition and reflection.	1
Great read!	1
I took the Great Courses course on "The Art of War," which inspired me to get the book. After reading the book, I went through the "Great Courses" again.	1
A lot of interesting ideas are in this book. However, it is a little difficult to grasp the ideas and apply it to today's world without rereading the book multiple times, thinking about it, and discussing your ideas with others.	1
Stewie Griffin was my inspiration to read this when I saw it was free for the kindle.  I have no knowledge of how good the translation is, the formatting was tolerable and there were likely some typos.  All in all, I thought it was a great read and several of his statements can be considered by modern day man in everyday dealings with people. A great read, and not too long.  The commentary was interesting as well (perhaps a bit sparse, but useful).	1
I loved it! Almost all of it is still relevant and applicable to the modern day! It’s a must read!	1
Learn from this book. There is much wisdom inside. This quick read is about mobilizing troops effectively, but anyone in a leadership role should read this to more effectively command the respect of the people who report to him/her, which will in term make them more loyal and a stronger team.	1
The book is a good read, but I prefer the original book, this one is more like a quick run down of the important points of the original book	1
Good reading. Made me think of being out there on a march way back in the days of hand weapons. Some good things apply to modern times. One I notice is when the men are dissatisfied they go and whisper together in small groups. Probably plenty more. Probably read it again. Goes along with "Journey to the West" in that way.	1
Good book	1
Much of these teachings can be applied to daily life.  They still teach this to cadets at military academies.	1
It would be nice if You tell people this is not the actual book its a summary if the book which, in my opinion is pointless u less your in school and to lazy to read a  book	0
Flimsy book, good subject matter. This book contains a collection of war proverbs. There is no explaining of the proverbs, so if you want more depth, you should spend more to get commentary included.	1
I've heard many people recommend this book, and yet it was not quite what I imagined it to be. Rather than a collection of lessons learned through the telling of historical events, it is rather more like a list of proverbs by which a general should carry out the act of war. What struck me most was the admonition to disregard the orders of your superior should the information available to you contradict that which has been handed down. This understanding of personal autonomy is, in my opinion, the most important lesson given.	1
A cheap printing	0
I dont know what this is. I ordered a book to read and I feel what I got is someone saying, "here is whats in the book". Dont buy this crap. Spend a few more dollars and get a proper book with authentic publisher so u can really grasp what this book has to say.	0
The quality and feel of the binding is excellent, especially for the price.	1
For those who wants to have a deeper understanding about war, this ebook is suited for you because it has all the informations that will enable you to understand all the underlying principles about war. A wonderful and interesting read. Thanks for this!	1
ok	1
Thanks to this baby I have everything I need to wage war on my opponents in the corporate jungle. That part about working around insurance rate changes, PE ratios, and how to slaughter the inflation effect on your bonds was stellar! Thank you Sunzi - you've change my life.	1
This book is a good, yet easy read.  It's easy to follow along with and the concepts in the book makes sense.  Apply this to modern day life and you can begin to build a strong mentality.	1
I had to read this because my students talked about it constantly. They believed that in the pages of the Art Of War were magic words to control and manipulate others. This book is very popular among the incarcerated.  The main difficulty they seen to have is the references to historical figures. I found the book interesting mainly because I love reading about history. Although i don't believe in book banning The art Of war along with a few other manipulation type books I personally feel should not be allowed in any jail or prison setting.	1
Great read in finding out some of the ins and outs of waging war. It seems practical, and would likely require more study for one to be successful in this field.	1
Ok read. Small examples  Wasn’t a fan. Only like 15 pages. I’d pursue other versions.	0
Fantastic book, great for military history buffs as well as people looking for a little advice on how to take control of your life and strategically plan the life ahead of you. I recommend this to many people and have personally given many copies as gifts.	1
These observations of human nature and the ways to accomplish your military aims are simple, interesting and true. Human nature remains the same! Amazingly, this advice is completely applicable to everyday life, especially in business relationships. This is one that reveals itself a little more with every reading.	1
Could use a little help with the translation-some simple little English mistakes in this version, but the elements of the book came through and were clear, and they are so, so valuable even in just figuring out how to navigate the modern world!  Great stuff!	1
This is the cheapest quality book that I have ever seen. Disappointing.	0
My professor recommend me to read this book before start the class. So I just got my a book. If u want to learn about strategy try to read this book.	1
Do you want to get into the minds of commanders and generals of past and present? THIS is the book you need. It was mandatory reading when I was in the Marines. The lessons and actions of troops has changed very little over the course of time. If you wonder why commanders do what they do please read this book.	1
Read it, apply it metaphorically to your everyday life and DOMINATE. If you live a competitive lifestyle with an open mind that can bridge gaps...this book is for you...again....read it...and again...read it....again and again and again (it's a quick read(s))	1
The Art of War is one of those books that has wisdom for everybody, regardless of their walk in life. While most of the information is directed at soldiers and generals, and their behavior, it contains insights that are applicable to dealing with co-workers, bosses and strangers on the street.	1
great product!	1
One of best books ever written for strategy construction, for an ever growing number of applicable battlefields.   War is HELL..and has been for long before, Sun Tzu..he was just the best at writing the best strategy down.   Take my Word please...this is always a good purchase.	1
This book applies to all that you do, I truly like a few quotes I can use daily.	1
Ok	1
Classic!!!	1
I have long been a fan of this book. Many years ago I was a tank officer in the US Army, and believe me, Sun Tzu knew what he wrote about. The language may seem stilted, but the principles are clear. Some thing never change. The Easton edition is a superior translation and an elegant presentation.  I recommend it highly.	1
Not the full length book!	0
Plan on reading it twice at the least.  There is allot in the text that needs to be mentally squeezed out.	1
Very interesting book that was very easy to read. Would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning ways to improve your life, or someone who has interest in eastern philosophies.	1
Great product	1
I needed this for my son who has it as a set text in a Civics class. It's a perfectly decently made book at a price which makes it cheaper than printing out sections at home from public domain sources, and it's a lot easier to read this way too. Hey, I may even 'borrow' it back to improve my own education!	1
Great	1
I thought I was buying the actual book -- this is like a cliff notes version that I think I actually like better What it does is basically summarize main topics and breaks them down into a few quotes from the "actual" book that convey the meaning I was actually using this book to help my poker game and it worked	1
This is a short but detailed book. Pay attention and invite it into your life	1
This book is on the "Must Read" of all Military Colleges.  And that is through out the world.  It has been printed in every language known to man.  It is simple - It is direct.  It is how to win a war.  It may be a thousand years old, but, even with today's modern war machines, still applies.  The only problem - And It Is A Big Problem.............  You are buying "The Art of War" (Illustrated).  Problem:  There is not one illustration in the entire Kindle edition.  Do yourself a favor - buy a paperback with the illustrations in them - They are important.	1
The Art of War takes the battle plans and uses psychological principles to win against any enemy. Written in simple, descriptive language that anyone can read and apply to whatever adversarial situation presents itself. It can even be interpreted as a relationship guide! The Art of War also states ways of "fighting without having to fight at all." Brilliant and as relatable as it was when it was originally written. Everyone should have this book on their nightstand...next to their Bible!!	1
This book is full of knowledge that not only applies to war, but also life. The lessons learned in this book can be allied to relationship, friendship, career and make you a more complete person in general. I recommend this book to be read by all those I care about becoming a better person.	1
Ancient wisdom carried down through time to our culture is found in this work. it is applicable to most walks of life, particularly if one is in a position of authority over many persons and or required to intelligently utilize scarce resources. A fun book.	1
For us this is a reference book, a code for life. Every time you read it you discover something new and useful	1
Nice slim, sleek book. Very satisfied.	1
Its just a 20 summary of the book which could be useful, but I thought I was getting the full book. I want my money back because it doesn't specify that its not actually the book.	0
I've heard how this is a good book to read for examples of running a business. There are good points that can be extrapolated but you definitely need to read between the lines and look for the true meaning.	1
This was the fourth time I read The Art of War. I really love the book and strongly recommend it to anyone. It's truly one of the most timeless books there is and you can apply these principles whether you're a student, businessman or anything else. However, this edition is quite poor as there's a ton of mistakes, wrong translations, etc. Try to look for other possibilities how to read it (there's dozens of versions of TAOW both on Kindle and on paper).	1
The book was in good condition. It was ordered as a replacement for one I loaned out and never got back, thank you.	1
This is very misleading! I was expecting the full book and it turned out to be a summary, someone's bullet notes. I feel cheated	0
Great read for anyone who may be interested in a stratagem for living a fulfilling and complete life. Must read I'd you haven't already, or great piece for any collector!	1
A+	1
Simple statements that can be applied to life staegies	1
Well one cannot properly review at work this venerable, it's worth noting that Sun Tzu's conceptions of nature, natural law, and human condition conform to much of later Western thought.	1
Sun Tzu is a genius and this book is a timeless classic.  When faced with a problem, make sure your on the right side.  Then plan all your moves and take into account all possible outcomes.  Make sure your plan is fool-proof then use your greatest strength against your problems weakest or key root issue.  Read the book for yourself and you will find that the book can be applied to a variety of situations from problem solving, to sports, to success in life. a great read!	1
Who wouldn't love a copy of this classic?	1
It wasn’t the best... the cover was pretty flimsy and almost ripped off in my bag. But the content is all good.	1
Received a shortened copy. Ended up going to bookstore to buy what I was looking for.	0
Not what i had expected at all. I had ordered it thinking that this was translated by Samuel B. Griffith and it is not. If you look inside the book, it says "Translated by Lionel Giles" Don't let the ad fool you.. Did return it and I will be definitely looking closer at this the next time i buy a book.	0
Great read, personally believe it's a book everyone should read, no matter how you feel about war. The book was good quality and I had no complaints about it.	1
Great book	1
The Art of War was shared with me by my Dad many years ago, and I continue to find new bits of wisdom and perspective every time I read it. This book has helped guide my leadership decisions and has given confidence to my conflict resolution abilities. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about leadership wisdom.	1
Summary. Not the real book.	0
This is a great, cheap version of the book, which should be a required reading. I loved it and I'm sure you will too as it is written in bullet form since the statements are slightly complex and have deeper meaning.	1
Good deal for the price point.	1
Great Read valuable information and lessons applied to all aspects of life.	1
I like that everyone will take something different away from this book, it’s timeless because of its truth, you see the things he mentions everyday in people all these years later.	1
Friend enjoyed the book.	1
Not impressed thought I was buying a book that would last me more than a day of reading. It is more of a really condense version of a classic. Guess I will buy the original from a real book store.	0
The art of war is the art of control over the battlefield over your opponent and over yourself.	1
Bought for my boyfriend for Christmas. He really likes it.	1
This is a very poor excuse for a book. There’s 5 completely blank pages at the end. It’s like they translated the original art of war through google translate.	0
Haven't read it yet. But fiancee says it is a good read and explores the mind of the author.	1
Classic book. Everyone has heard at least a few proverbs from Sun Tzu, and that’s all this book is made up of. It’s a light read and is nice to pick up for a page or two when cooking or something.	1
This is was a little different than I expected after hearing about it from so many different people. It is a good short read, but most of it is actual strategy useful during the Dynasty wars. There are a few concepts from it that I am implementing in my own life though and would recommend anyone to read it as it is short and does contain some wisdom.	1
Nice to read even all these years after the first time I read it in high school.  Makes for great listening too on long trips.	1
Good read	1
I give this App a 5 Star because what it tells is still relevent in today's modern warfare. And the price can't be beat it'd free. I'd recommend this to all military personnel as a must read. And to all civilians who are interested in the Art of War. I'd highly recommend this App/Book.	1
This is a short book of leadership strategy and tactics for war. There is wisdom for everyone regardless of your role in any career or job. Public administration is tied to this poem in terms of managing resources, human capitol, fellow servicemen, and the public.	1
Got to be in a certain frame of mind for this one.  Might be empowering to someone fighting a battle in this world.  For the rest of us it's either a yawn or disturbing.  Probably won't hurt you to read it but there is probably something else out there more empowering.	1
Great!	1
Great knowledge for myself  an amaising book great insight  certainly a book for the ages  and for leaders of all  walks of life.	1
I read for pleasure and to hone my writing skills. This is a great classic.	1
Good advise for life	1
Not the real full book just a short summed up pamphlet about the original.	0
This ancient text is as useful today as it was in ancient history.	1
His genius is still followed to this day.	1
This book was for my husband	1
This book is very thin almost like a pamphlet. If I had known that I wouldn't have bought it.	1
Over-rated.  Too many people try to quote from this book without actually reading it. Historically it shows an interesting perspective on conquering forces, but there are better sources to get more complete information.	1
How on earth are all the other people giving this book 5 stars??? Surely they have not opened it, they probably just bought it to leave it on their coffeetable to impress their friends. Well, the cover does look nice, but if you actually OPEN it you'll rapidly see that 1. There is NO forward, author info, translation notes or any other content. Not even an Index. 2. Numerous mispelling and even missing text. 3. Page titles at top are both the name of the book instead of chapter. Very useful. (Sarcasm) I bought 4 copies in order to give my friends. I will be giving these to Goodwill and buying a different version.	0
Looks like a google translate of chinese language. It was like reading the fortune from a fortune cookie ;)	0
love it, just what I needed.	1
the test of time proves that not much changes in our world or the many years or warfare threw the centuries	1
This is a short version of the book. Disappointed because it didn't give any indication that this was a short version of the book in the descriptions. The worse part is I didn't read the reviews until now and other people had the same issues.	0
not the art of war book	0
I’m not much of a reader but the history behind this book got me intrigued.	1
I prefer paperback and this short book was worth the read.	1
Should have just printed out a PDF or such online. While it is a "book", it's merely a few pages of material that's professionally printed by the Amazon on-demand system. Meh. At least I helped someone make money...	0
It is an attractive little volume but the content is very limited. Guess I'll look at the full edition.	1
This seems kind of like a cliff notes version of the full book. Maybe I'm wrong as I didn't read this one. It was a gift. It has larger print and is thinner than my copy however. Regardless this is a great price for a book that has many applications in life regarding strategy.	1
Most popular book for those with careers in the military. Everyone should read this short book	1
Good book! Easy to read, and i would suggest watching a movie that will show u some great strategies from the times it was written. Like "Red Cliff", or a good drama like "General and I", "The general" anything period that is chinese or korean! So much fun!	1
Great read packed with a great strategy in life advise.	1
“The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death. A road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.”	1
This is a good book for anyone. Business, politics or just improving yourself. If you don't own it then just buy it. It's cheap, short and you know you don't want to be a part of the 80% of Americans who have not bought a book in the last year. Lets bring that number down a bit	1
There is a reason this book is a well-known classic. I found The Art of War to be insightful and useful for everyday situations as well as in reference to war. It is more about philosophy than actual combat, and so it is not just for Generals and CEOs.	1
Wonderful read.	1
Short/dumbed down version of the real book. Do not waste your time and purchase then, better luck at a half price books. Very disappointed with seller not putting this in summary.	0
I thought there would be more to it. I mean it served it's purpose for what I was looking for, but I guess there was not any explanation or illustrations. It was more like a starter book for other books of this ilk. It will force the reader to think about each section read so I believe that could be a good thing.	1
good product	1
It’s a good overview of the book but sadly not the whole thing like I thought it to be. I still enjoy it though.	1
Not the full book just a shortened summary of it	0
Great Book	1
This product was extremely disappointing. I paid a high price for a very standard book which was supposed to be a special addition. I was hoping the cover would have been made out of a high quality material instead this book was a standard quality book at a very high price.	0
This is a little book I love, while some it is changed by the logistics of our modern flight-based world of today, the gist of it right to the point is that every time we ignored the most basic advice in this book, we lost or backed out of a war that we failed to understand why the other side fought so hard for, such as the Vietnam war, where North Vietnam's General Giap and the Vietcong used a very successful 'Go' strategy while we lost the war by not understanding the strategy of the enemy, attempted to use a chess strategy, to our detriment.('Go' is a game where you occupy the most territory with the least number of pieces, in chess you occupy the most territory with the most pieces with the sole objective being to capture the King.) You will find much to contemplate in reading this book if you like to think, and you value freedom, democracy, liberty and the responsibility of keeping and maintaining that democracy as the flip-side of liberty. Freedom/Responsibility go hand in hand to those who want to keep this experiment in democracy we love so dearly.	1
Just like described soft cover and delivered on time	1
Great book	1
This book though dry every now and then is very knowledgeable about warfare. This book is also great because even though its about warfare has so many other applications outside of warfare.	1
Great addition to my husband’s library!	1
Great book and read.	1
Very nice paper, clear large font, and nice spacing of text. Very easy to read. The actual content makes perfect sense and is easy to remember, partially, I think, because of how it is presented.	1
And win	1
I’ll definitely make this book a yearly read. I haven’t highlighted so much material in awhile. And will be putting some of these tactics into everyday living.	1
Fast shipping	1
Great book for me to jump in and out of. Slim so it doesn’t take up much space	1
This book is as it name states an art. To follow this in life we could gain but to do as it tells not to will give defeats	1
This material must be repeatedly read in order to absorb its full impact.  Premises of The Art of War were violated over and over by the Bush administration and our Army.  I once understood that our military schools of war at one time studied this material...... Now, I guess not!	1
DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!	0
Good product	1
Bought it, because this is the book that started me on my life long journey.	1
This isn’t even the whole book. It’s a bunch of quotes from the original book. What a waste.	0
A must read for everyone esp for ladies if they are going thru a divorce.	1
Great book,  I will complete my plans for world domination soon.  Allegedly the us armed forces still read this short book to give thought on the truth of how real war works.  Was also an entertaining read.	1
Great	1
VERY WELL DONE!!!!!!! Highly Recommend!!!	1
the art of war is a guide where the best war strategies are explained. concise, straight foreward and logic strategies.	1
The manner in which the translations and explanations jump back and forth tends to be confusing. I found myself flipping back and forth a lot. Otherwise, it's an excellent read for anyone. As a supervisor, I've found that I've applied a lot of the stratagem laid out in this book in my work life.	1
YUP!!!!  I've read it and will be sending to my son!!!	1
I see what some folks mean by being a hard read, but it's great education!	1
The absolute best military strategy guide ever written.every soldier should read it.	1
I first read this as a library book as I did some research for an RPG character. I was fascinated by it and always wanted my own copy. I finally got one and it's STILL as fascinating to me as it was originally.	1
Do not let the title fool you. This is not so much about war as it is about relationships and leadership. I am a 50 year old house wife and mother.  I am also a writer and constantly searching for insights and inspirations.  I inherited this copy of the book from my son when he left for college.  Read a page or two a day; sometimes a paragraph will do!  The words are thousands of years old but the wisdom is timeless.	1
some things don't change with time. the art of war discusses how to keep the big picture in focus, maintain check and balances (including hubris) and  how to react to others. it is geared for generals wielding war in ancient China, but the points are relevant for anyone doing business.	1
Great read	1
Gift for my husband. Not what he expected.	1
These rules certainly apply to the time of war, but also apply to the business, raising the young, and to life in general.	1
Good product	1
Good book.	1
Sometimes to most simple things are the hardest to articulate, but Sun Tzu is the master of turning simple psychology into art. 2,613 years later, it is amazing how his words have stood the test of time, and how prevalent they still are to this day.	1
A lot of word definition searches, not a thriller but interesting and a quick read. Most will lose interest on the first page.	1
Alot thinner than I remember, but still contain useful information	1
I love	1
this is a pamphlet, it isn't the actual book	0
Love this book	1
As described and shipping was fast! Happy with my order.	1
The link I thought I was purchasing was a version translated by Thomas Cleary with an introduction and commentary. This version (the black cover, white lettering with red shadow and red lines) has neither and there is no mention of who the translator is.	0
Great read. The one problem I have is that the commentary can get REALLY annoying. Gets in  the way of the main text. I know the only way to do away with it is to read it in the original Chinese, but maybe have a footnote for the pointm then have the commentary at the end of the chapter.	1
Brief, interesting read! Every politician and business and military leader should give this work consideration. If I could, I would send a copy to the White House. I doubt it would be read though.	1
to overcome theose who seek to destroy you, one must first understand their ideology and intent, and then refrain from getting mired by fear in a 'normalcy bias' when they say they are committed to kill you.	1
Came as a pamphlet/brochure. No binding, and cheaply made.	1
The full length book is great. This however is someone’s cliff notes of the book. And it’s not even a good summary. This is not the full length book.	0
Great product fast shipping	1
I'd buy again...and again !!! I love it..	1
Do NOT waste your money...this is a useless poorly written HIGH level summary. I am disappointed	0
This is not a real book and nowhere it says that these are notes from the book, very thin book, disappointing.	0
Cant beat the price for this book.	1
Do not buy this. It's not the actual book.  They'll take your money immediately and you'll never see it again.	0
Its the Art of War.	1
For over a decade now this book has made the rounds in my inner circle and Everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. As for me I saw very little use for such a book. And since I see no real use, I felt no real delight I suppose young military leaders would enjoy this.	1
Thanks!	1
Good book, thought it would be longer	1
I have seen this book used as a reference for many years.  Wish I had read it when I was a young man.	1
I ripped the cd so I can listen to it on my phone at work. No good all I get is "my cd" and the chapters reading the same. I used Media Monkey to rip and look up Amazon DB for tagging, still nothing. It is very annoying when stopping and starting during the day to know what chapter you're on. So this was a waste of money and time trying to tag it and listen to it. Especially when many other audio books are in the same format and trying to go back I may end up listening to another book all together. Not worth the effort to try and manually tag each track. Lesson learned for me and will sell it at work.	0
Cheap, cover is pixelated A F. But it was 5 bucks. I can no declare war on the Chinese.	1
This book illustrates a lot of fundamental aspects of how to conduct a operation, I thought the concepts were true and basic.  For a more in depth reading experience, that is if you don't already know what your buying and what you want, I suggest machiavelli's art of war.  Matter of taste I guess.  I enjoyed both books, I feel I walked away with more from machiavelli's art of war.	1
Fav book came as supspected	1
The Art of War was interesting when you think about how old this book is and see the different tactics discussed in it.  I have heard many times too, that this is a good read for people in the business world today.  I agree with that in part.  There are parts of the book that are translatable to the business world but a lot that are not. Overall it is a very short book.  I'm glad I finally read it, but not one I was blown away by.	1
False advertisement. Should clearly state what “chump change edition” means somewhere. This is NOT The Art of War; this is someone’s poor summary of the book.	0
I had heard so much about "The Art of War" I decided to read it.  Alas, it's only one hundred seventy large-font pages.  What saves this book is the very good introduction, some sixty-five pages, that I would have been lost in the sauce without.	1
I don't remember buying this book.  It probably was for my English class when I was an undergrad in college.  I'm not sure, I don't remember sorry I'm not more helpful.  However, I do know about the book and after reading it a couple of times I do understand it more clearly now and it is good	1
A classic truly a must have but this format sucks book is too thin and too wide for my taste	1
An excellent read. The principles of this book apply to so many aspects of life. It is not a long book. In fact, it is very short. That being said, you could read it in an hour or two, or you could chew on its words for an entire lifetime.	1
Just as described, the way it should be.	1
One of the best books I ever read....but it took me a few times to fully understand what Sun Tzu was saying. The philosophies in this book can be applied to most anything, and should be a must-read for every leader.	1
DO NOT BUY! This is false advertising! I am so disappointed. This is not The Art of War. This is a cheap photocopied book of bullet points. I am so upset. What a waste!	0
👌🏾	1
No where in the description does it say it is a shortened version of the book. I feel like I was ripped off.	0
This is a great read, and I am surprised it isn't required reading in schools. Can provide great outlooks on life, Decision making, and leadership. A timeless classic that I hope stays with us forever.	1
Reading	1
This is not the book, it has quotes and is abbreviated, even compared to cliff notes.  If you want a very simple gist of real book, this may be for you.	0
Awsome book. If you like learning about ancient civilization army rules and leadership... this is definitely the book for you. Don't forget this is and asian book which was translated to English. The version is ok and the translation is awsome as well.	1
This is a shortened 60 page version of the book. Nowhere on the page was it stated that this was anything but the full book. This is a rip off.	0
Description was not clear.	0
I enjoy skimming through the statements.	1
Great book if you want to learn about strategy in any context.	1
Read this several times in my life - I purchased this copy for a friend as he had never read it. Buy it & read it. You won't regret it.	1
Not the full book. Don’t buy.	0
Nice book	1
Helps ya understand how,why,where and what your enemy expects.	1
The Best Buy. I love these books	1
Not that much info after hearing about this book in various movies and other books! Slow, but interesting read! Bought the small, non fancy version hoping to get into the material!	0
This is something that is worth listening too.	1
Can't wait to read!	1
Scam. Not the real book!	0
👍👍👍👍👍	1
a little on the small side a good light read but has all the good info	1
This book is packed with great information for life on and off the battlefield. So many of it's principles apply to sports and the business world. Students: if you need to write a paper on some military event in history, this book should be your starting point. Use it to back up your main points or thesis and you'll win the day!	1
The book was very helpful to receive. It served as a welcomed gift.	1
This give a stylized and sparse outline of some possible principles of was as it pertains to feudal times. Very little applies to todays types of conflicts and provides little to no true advice about conflict resolution.	1
I think this is one of the must read books everyone should read once in their lifetime.  Not only does it give a good outlook on miltary tactics- it tells you the logic behind them... which you can apply to other situations or intances in life	1
A quick and easy read. Maybe not the most entertaining, but still interesting.	1
Read this simply because "it's a classic". Nothing really terrific here, not sure it's worth paying for. Go rent it at a library. Book version/translation was good.	1
Although this book talks about war, the principles taught in this book can be put to use in any area of your life. The Art of War is short, but a good read. A classic that is still relevant today!	1
This is a good book to read if you were living in 200 AD. These ancient techniques no longer apply in 2017.	1
The first of the book is essentially a bullet pointed list that can translate very well into the business world.	1
Strategically wonderful!  It helps you to uderstand the actual art of planning and executing any type of war (think of it from all of its aspects).  I encourage you to purchase this book, it is well worth its price.	1
A good interpretation of a classic.  Would recommend.	1
A classic well worth the read if you are interested in how war is fought! It is not only used for war but everyday life problems and things like business.	1
First time trying to buy "The Art of War" and had not realized this was a summary and the listing does not mention this "book" is in fact a summary.	0
This was a good book,it was just more dry of a story than what I usually like to read. I recommend this if you are more into the Buddhist culture,as it is centered on pretty much killing your enemies with kindness.	1
Good	1
Great job providing "The Art of War" affordably.  Quality of printing is ok.	1
I was very disappointed​ to learn that this was an outline of the book when I got it yesterday. I was really looking forward to reading an actual book.	0
I have heard this book touted as "great" so many times that I finally decided to give it a try.  I was most disappointed.  The book is just a series of one-liners on different things to do in war.  Some of the little one-liners didn't even make much sense.  And the book is totally disorganized with no connection from one one-liner to the next.  And finally, there were way too many editing errors.  I was expecting a well-thought-out and organized expose on how to carry out a successful war....something on the order of Machiavelli's very astute and very clear way to obtain and retain power as set out in "The Prince."  No comparison.	0
Looks good	1
Unlike the Griffin translation this edition, which is from the late 19th century, intermixes the text and the commentary.  In a way that's good because it's easier to associate the text to the commentary, but sometimes the commentary isn't all that good or insightful.	1
A gift	1
The Art of War is famous throughout the world for good reason and is required reading by many business schools, law schools, government, intelligence and military organizations, and all for goo dc reason. I believe anyone in our global job market would also benefit from reading this book.	1
Book is basically translated versions of quotes written by Sun Tzu. Little hard to grasp as it lacks detailed explanation but still a great book to have.	1
I tried several times to read this book. I even got half way through it before I gave up the last time. It is just plain BORING! There isn't even colorful descriptors to keep you awake. Truthfully, after trying three times to read this, I still have absolutely no idea what it's about.	0
Not sure what all the fuss is about with this book. I didn't find it to be at all great. It's short though, so if you want to find out for yourself, it's not a big commitment.	1
Great book, can apply in negotiating daily obstacles, without arms. You can use to improve your outcome.	1
This is THE classic, ageless work of warfare.	1
Every man should read this (woman too)! You could practically utilize any lens to what's in these teachings and apply them to everything.	1
This is a well-respected and inexpensive book written more than two thousand years ago. It can teach you many things.	1
Rip off	0
A classic, short read. If we can decipher the meanings behind it, has some valuable information that can be applied to life.	1
I fell for it. It’s not a full book. It’s 65 pages and printed by a random amazon seller making money off someone else’s work.	0
If you have not read this book I don't know how you got a business mgt. job.... It's cut-throat and how life really is... As a former combat Marine a lot of this hit's home. As a business man every page hits home!	1
Lives up to the hype. Timeless messages.	1
I found it to be a tough read	1
The content is fine and not excellent.	1
Bought as Christmas gifts for my sons. Both are history buffs and both are looking forward to reading this book.	1
Received on time and as expected.	1
Rip off!  Nothing but list of chapter headings.  Thief!!!	0
A classic read. I can see why people use this little book as a life manual, and can be applied to most any lifestyle, job/career, and/or multiple situations.	1
Not so much a book but just excerpts.  Can read it in an hour or less. Who cares for $3 tho	1
Arrived sooo fast with only a few days notice and the book is gorgeous.  The leather cover is beautiful--reminiscent of the days when books were hand made before printing presses	1
A book bought for my daughter & she enjoyed it!	1
it was want i was looking for thank you.	1
This is the book to do it. Albeit a bit old school but if you're willing to line up like they did back in the day, this is a great tactician book. I think overall this was to show how you should think if you want to lead.	1
The Art of War is a classic. I have read it 5 times at least. We actually read it in one of my jobs as well. You can apply what you read in the Art of War to so many aspects of life. I would highly recommend reading it.	1
good read	1
Just as described and very fast shipping, thank you!!!	1
This is a classic text that I have never read before.  It is so interesting to see the perspective that it offers and the applications and relevance that it has today.  A book that is remarkable in it's simplicity and expression of common sense.  It makes me wonder how and where we've lost our way.	1
great read	1
I thought the book would be much bigger. Turns out this was sort of like a pamphlet. I guess you get what you pay for.	1
Disliked it wasnt the full book dont buy trust me i just biught another book this one has 68 pages	0
I loved the book. Short read full of wisdom,knowledge,strategy, tactics,and ways. For the past, present and future.Book was,is and will be as well as can be translated and acted in life in many ways not just war.	1
This book is a classic, and full of wisdom.  If I were you, I'd pay another $3 and get a decent cover and translation--this one had misspellings and incomplete sentences.  If you just want the text, you can read this for free online.	1
I had been aware of this book for many years but always bypassed it.  A mentor recently recommended it as an important resource for a different perspective on the business world.  I found that this small volume spurred a lot of ideas for me.  A great place to learn some tools for negotiation.	1
Perfect as a flash card idea, but the actal writing of the book jumps quickly from one idea to the next, no to say the idea of such trait is not unlike a general commanding his army, but the writing lacks ideas, and leave little for the imagination to work with, simply put, its more of a lesson book to a reader to take command of something and then tacticianlly keep it, weather it be a life style, roll, or a idea or psyical thing. Specializing in a singular idea, war, the facts on how to control and be victorious in a battle of metal or mind.	1
Excellent book of ancient, but still relevant, wisdom of war tactics and strategy. This is the best, it was beautifully put together!!	1
Not even the full text. Does not mention that anywhere in the description, it's just cliff notes.	0
Loved it	1
I bought this for the kindle app. It was free.  I had read it once before in paperback form and loved it.  It seems to be better than I remember it from 10 years before. I think this should be required reading for everyone, at least once.	1
The art of war is a great book. Good for strategic planning.	1
Good read it prepares you for life before Drama happens.	1
It was alright I mean it's a classic so I had to read it but I totally think that are better books you can read about business or war the good thing is that is a very short read so you can finish it in less than a day like I did	1
The classic breakdown of how to gain and leverage an advantage. Sun Tzu was mostly writing about military strategy but his principles can be applied to almost anything in these "modern" times. Very interesting!	1
Ancient Wisdom when dealing with battle and military might. I guess I was expecting the wisdom to translate over into everyday life in the modern  corporate or civilian world. It didn't.  However after studying this book I have learned that strategy and taking your enemy into account in all it's variables weakness and strengths is to have higher ground when accessing your attack plans. Basically know your enemy inside and out then let them fall prey to your plans.  I am glad this was a short book because it took a lot of strain to decipher this stuff. It wasn't a fun read at all but I am glad that now I can say that I read it.  Definitely a read for those with an acquired taste. Otherwise a more compatible self empowerment book may be more useful.	1
Not what I expected. Did not like the format AT ALL. Waste of money.	0
What can you say about this e-mail book. This has been studied by all branch of the USA armed services professional courses taken by Officers and NCO' s. Great e-mail book. I love it.	1
Just what I was looking for!	1
A classic	1
Not the full length version, had some weird sticky substance on the front cover and back cover	0
it was not proofed, they used spell check and spell check didn't catch wrong words (head instead of heed) if you don't know what youre reading it could be confusing	1
great deal	1
Lots of great insight with this one	1
Actually a very easy read, and chock-full of principles that apply to getting ahead in life, not only in war.  The timeless principles are broken up into bite sized chunks that don't take a lot of your time to consume.  Good read, well worth my time.	1
Bought this mainly as a required reading for myself.  There's plenty of books out there that parody this philosophy.  Mainly I bought it as a reference.  People may think your weird though if quote it all the time around the water cooler.	1
LARGE PRINT, easy to read with a strong cover for a paperback Good value at only $4 it's a classic, go get it (and keep winning)	1
great read	1
Not the one expected. This is for kids	0
Great book	1
Unbelievable! This is like a 50 page summary of the book. IT’s NOT THE FULL TEXT!!! I can’t believe I got scammed out of $12 for this crap.	0
Great product	1
About 68 pages only. NOT THE FULL version. We should be given a refund! Thought I was getting the whole book. Amazon should do something about this. Nowhere does it say its not a full version.	0
Don’t buy this... it’s cheap and... the translation is so bad. You won’t understand the meaning.	0
It is only a summary. This fact is not stated in the description of the book	0
This book was drab in some parts and interesting in others. Some of the commentary was too extensive for the average reader. I love how the lessons of Sunni are still relevant in modern warfare.	1
Beware! This is NOT the whole book!	0
I am retired military (24 years) and have used this book throughout my career. Now that I am retired and working in the civilian sector, I still apply a lot of principles from the Art of War.	1
Just added this to my collected editions of books, good read!	1
This is not the full book, which is what I intended to buy.  Not advertised well enough that it's a shortened version.	0
Sister loves this book! Great Xmas gift!	1
Ive been meaning to read The Art of War for several years now. Grabbed this translation because it was free. The translator does a good job of comparing various other translations of the book and noting where they differ and what he thinks is the most likely/accurate translation of a particular passage.	1
Strategy at best.	1
I get the main characters point Great book and very informative. Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer. Characters and other plot.	1
An amazing manual for nearly everything in life, Sun Tzu's knowlege transcends all time and all people. As he said the best way to win is to not fight at all.	1
Love it! Very insightful	1
Very good insight despite being a centuries old document. I would've given it five stars but the "illustrated" aspect if the book was poor on the paper white kindle.	1
The art of management is very much like the art of war.  If you are a manager, or want to be a manager, this is one of the very best books to read.	1
perfect	1
Condensed version. It took ten minutes to read the whole book. The full version is better.	1
Heard it via audio and it was really good, interesting and helpful. Great information and perspective on how to use your mind and resources to conquer all of your goals.	1
I ordered this in large print, and they did not disappoint!! My boyfriend is super excited!	1
Great read!	1
Great and applies to life in many ways.	1
This paperback edition was in new shape, and easy to understand. Highly recommend this book for anyone studying the subject of strategy in relation to competitive business or in general.	1
Finally read it. When I was in B-school everyone said this was a MUST read...but I never got around to it. Having read it now, my reaction is "meh".	1
classic book, if you're able to abstractly apply these concepts to life you can get ahead much easier.	1
Very short reads (less than 20 minutes) but good information.	1
Great read.	1
Gelreat meaning book	1
It is a great reference, or the adage-of-the-day sort of book, that you can read to gather and clear your thoughts, and organize and launch your next attack (read critical decision).	1
It is book. I love book.	1
This has become my favorite book, i have read this a dozen times, very good quality paper and binding. Would definitely recommend this book, i love it!	1
Fast easy read good book.	1
A classic and more fun to read as an adult than when in school and thus forced to read it. Certainly has some life lessons, not sure if that is a good or bad thing though.	1
Relates to many different areas of business and life. Anyone interested in reading a timeless classic should make a note of this book.	1
For a book I consider required reading, this is a nice Kindle edition.  I'm a stickler for formatting, and although there would be a few changes I would make, the text is fairly accurate.	1
This is the best Kindle version I could find among other badly formatted, comment riddled versions on the Kindle Store but this one is nicely prepared and worth buying and reading. 10/10	1
I feel as though I can lead an army.	1
Tactics and philosophies from this book can be incorporated into any aspect of life that we face.	1
A Bible for future Military Officers	1
One of the first kindle books purchased. I enjoyed the simplicity of reading. The structure of the book and the information made for excellent reading. This book should be read by business people and leaders.	1
it takes awhile to understand how to read and interpit this book, a must read ,if you know anything about the art of war its not just about war its about life, should be mandatory read would recommend	1
Short version of the book. I wouldn't recommend getting this unless you want a short version.	1
Where’s the rest of the book? Shocked to receive a “summary” book and not the full text!! Rip-off central with this purchase and it doesn’t say anything in the description when purchasing!!	0
Laughable really...68 pages of bullet points. I feel like this is something that I would see while surfing facebook.	0
It is what I expected, needed my copy.	1
Thank you	1
A friend recommended that I read "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu and I had to look every where just to find an edition containing the words of Sun Tzu. Other reworks were filled with so much commentary that it was difficult to actually understand what Sun Tzu was saying. This copy gives of the work is clear and easy to read, it is extremely enticing and even though it was written more than 2500 hundred years ago, it is probably more relevant now than ever before. The introduction written by Steven Schrang is also enticing and gives great insight into who Sun Tzu was. Great Read!	1
a clasic	1
Tiny little book with so much information.	1
nice book. smaller than expected	1
Classic book. A must read for anyone looking for something different.	1
Teaches you a new way to think.	1
Thought it was longer but good read	1
I have been studying and reading and re-reading this book for inclusion in my studies in combat readiness, movement of troops and completion of battle in various locations and climates.  An excellent work.	1
I have read a few versions of The Art of War. This is my favorite version. I will have to read it a few more times before I will be self satisfied by the teachings.	1
Third reading.  Great and useful	1
I have multiple copies.  Recommended reading for any leader.	1
Great read though a tad challenging but that is what draws you in	1
It is The Art of War by Sunzi (translated to english). This is on The Comandant's Reading List for the United States Marine Corps. Read it, Understand it, Apply it to national policy, and gain understanding of war economics as well as the decline of the U.S. military as a fighting force.	1
I liked this book, It was interesting and a lot of what is said could apply not only to war, but to business, or to sport, or to teaching. Overall an interesting read.	1
Just horrible. I could've printed a nicer copy at home. About 30 pages long and felt like a high school student's summary of Sun Tzu's philosophy.	0
I purchased this as a gift for Christmas as it was on the recipient's Amazon list. They thanked me and were thrilled.	1
I think its a good book, I would know if I could get it back from my sons (-:	1
This is the book that men would want for general reading. Simple statements that can generate conversation. Easy.	1
This is the highly abridged version. Still some neat info	1
I liked the book because we all face the art of war in our daily lives. Wheather  we have to meet a deadline at work or working out to stay fit. The art of war is at play in our lives.	1
book is good, I guess I am just not into it like I tght I would be	1
An excellent book as everyone knows of course. A recommended read for all persons. A true timeless classic. A must read for any young adult or aspiring leader of men/women.	1
A classic of classics.  The man who best understood war has taught generations how prepare and prevent it.  Worthy of deep study and application in all aspects of life.	1
Very misleading. This isn't a real version of the book. It's just a summary.	0
I really like the messages of both, Hubbart's letter is incredible and full of good sense. The Art of the war, on the other hand, is a must for your life, it contains the solution for many human concerns. Both are amazing.	1
I think this is the cliff notes to the actual book.	1
I have heard this book referenced in popular culture for years as something that provided lessons in war that were applicable to conflict and contained good strategy advise across the spectrum.  I have to say, I agree.	1
A must read for anyone who has a tough struggle. This book is thin, light and perfect for travel. Not ideal as a gift ... It is flimsy if you want a nice copy, I'd look for another one.	1
Classic - be advised which version you buy. This was a lot smaller than I expected. That's on me tho ya digg? I recommend the "shambhala dragon edition" translated and edited by Thomas cleary It's got in-depth breakdowns of the material that pull from multiple perspectives.	1
This is so far from anything that resembles the original!	0
This is a book that focuses your mind and makes you think of things that would not commonly occur to you as a matter of strategy be it life, work or war.	1
And MORE NINJA'S. But really, what can I say, it's Sunzi's Art of War, you either want to read it, or you don't!	1
I read this and proceeded to beat my neighbor up. Good read.	1
A classic. I've listened to the audio book a few times, have read it in a business strategy class, and purchased it for my library. Would recommend	1
A classic, not to be missed. Very easy to read, practical adive. Applies to everyday life's decisions.	1
This is the BEST book on strategy that has ever been written! This book is timeless. I have seen strategies from this book utilized in business and politics. It does not take long to read, but has a wealth of information.	1
The art of war may be required reading at the war college but I did not enjoy the book. Too much conversation about women and not in a good way. I deleted it from my kindle.	0
I have heard about the book for years and so I was very curious what it was about.  It's not overly large so that is good for me.  I found the book to be informative and easy to read.Two thumbs up!!	1
A must read for anyone interested in politics/business/philosophy or just life in general. This has a lot of meaning to those who read it properly, though understanding all of it may take time.	1
This is NOT the full book. This is more of the Clifnotes edition of the book.	0
This is a very cheaply made book, pages in mine were detached and some were cut unevenly even though its brand new, its very short from what I remember too...	0
The Art of War is a timeless masterpiece of interaction of power and politics. It is about war and not war. This version is the one you want if you are interested in the simple, yet profound wisdom of Sun Tzu. I have tried several other versions edited and commented on, thoughts and ideas spun left and spun right by other authors. There is no spin here simple staright forward thought and principles.	1
A must read	1
Simple. Literally. Does provide good strategies.	1
Good read	1
A great classic warfare book written by a man ahead of his time. Very good read. Book came in paperback and is skinny/small, but looks well and is a highly recommended read for the price!	1
Highly recommend reading this book.  The philosophies behind the logic are practical enough for everyday use for example, negotiations.  It is no wonder why so many business professionals read this book.	1
Purchased as a gift. Thank you.	1
Exactly what I expected!	1
I would recommend this book to anyone in the military or in leadership. It gives great insight into strategic thinking.	1
the greats never become out dated.  the lessons in this book can be applied to most aspects of life. have wanted to read this for years getting it on amazon finally made it possible	1
Trustworthy seller!Very good book! Recommend	1
Great literary classic. Good quality for a trade paperback. Very fairly priced.  Nice glossy cover.	1
Not the original book. Cheap copy.	0
Interesting read.  Common sense suggestions and instructions that applies to more than war.	1
This a fun read.. very entertaining.	1
Since this great book now fits inside my phone it is not a bad app for the price. I definitely do not regret my purchase and think almost everyone who gets this will feel the same way.	1
👍	1
If you need tips on handling situations in every day life you will enjoy this book. People of all ages can get great advice from this read try it today!	1
Not the book by Sun Tzu,this a condensed, misspelled version.	0
Have not rade it all.	1
This version was straight to the point and not too long. Not sure if other versions were longer. Reads like an army commanders tips and tricks manual to running an army.	1
good read	1
This is not the entire book. I don’t even know what this is.	0
This book is a classic and should be read by anyone looking to get ahead in life. IT does not have to be about war as much as common sense about thinking ahead. Good read, good message.	1
wise man said some basic wisdom lines about life and struggle of life. human nature hasn't changed much so it is true even nowdays. a splendid prospective for any strategy student today	1
booyah	1
A great read. Teaches you lessons that can be used in your everyday life.	1
Nice addition to my library.	1
Not the full book! Misleading, do not buy,	0
The original Chinese might not have been perfect but the English translator could have done a better job elucidating on some of the passages.  Many are just plain sloppy.	1
I've not read any other interpretations but I feel like I'm missing something.	1
The simplicity and straightforwardness of this book is why it had survived for so many years. These truths in ancient warfare still hold true today. Know your enemy. Know when to attack to ensure victory. These simple will get you far in life.	1
I had to read this for a class and what I took away from it was the lessons have meaning in modern times and will be a source of knowledge for years to come.	1
Awesome book.	1
I read it already in French, and I did now in English	1
This is a nice presentation of an otherwise difficult read.  The book is well presented and of course a must read for business professionals ... just so you can hold your own when someone sitting across the table from Harvard Business School starts quoting it.  Perhaps overthought I'm sure their are better tools for getting it's point across there's nothing like the original.	1
Provides with logic and philosophy applicable to everyday life and business, great brain exercise. Helps if you can use your imagination to apply it to your life.	1
Great Read!	1
I can't tell you how frequently I lost upwards of 100,000 men in battle, that is, until I read this book. I was frequently losing men to fatigue, and simply not controlling my army effectively. After purchasing, my victory rate has increased significantly, and I am a much more trained war general. Very good day-to-day read for prospective buyers who control armies.	1
I bought this as I read another review which mentions this book as a better alternative. Was not as thrilled as I thought I would be. I have other books on the Art of War that are far more explanation and practical use driven than this one.  The principles are easy but sometimes it was the commentaries from other military science leaders that convoluted the meanings and put their "spin" on Tzu's philosophy. While this is good for some, I bought this book for myself and another to just get the nuts and bolts.	1
why haven't you ordered it yet	1
:D	1
Easy to follow and the fonts were large enough to read.	1
This is definitely a book that should be required as a read for anyone! Very well written, especially considering the fact that our was written more than 2,000 years ago.	1
An excellent price for a classic book.  Delivered promptly.	1
As Promised and on time.  Thanks	1
This was a great read.	1
Son not impressed	0
Highly regarded by my friends who served in the military, I found the book most interesting in that the supposedly real-life author, Sun-Tzu, penned a series of letters that b came one of the earliest handbooks of war fighting. The translation I read had way too much commentary inserted throughout the text, making it difficult to get into the rhythm of the book. And obviously, the translations that survived are incomplete. Chapters appear to be missing entire sections, there is much that is desultory and even contradictory (especially the many chapters and sections on terrain) and even more that is simply obvious, even in the era these writings were thought to be composed.	1
This version does include most if not all of the maxims in Sun Tzu's Art of War. Unfortunately, with no introduction, no context, no commentary, and no annotations (present in many other versions), it's hard to make any sense of this vague and metaphorical ancient text. I would advise against buying this version if you want a thorough understanding of this seminal work.	0
All warfare is based on deception. Quotes are applicable in all walks of life	1
The physical book is great and the contents are well worth the read!	1
The book is an outline of a book? Total waste of money	0
I get a little more out of this every time I read it, very deep.	1
dismt realize it was a cliff note version, my bad, quick delivery	1
This is a great book, our government should read it so we do not have extended wars that are not then net answer to a solution.	1
These were for a prison library.  Very helpful for the inmates.  Helps with chess and negotiation.	1
As described.	1
It arrived with other items in a big box but the item was in perfect condition	1
The book is not the complete version.	0
Amazing	1
Not a full length book. It doesn't say that in the product description. I feel tricked.	0
Classic book about ancient military strategy.  Many applications to military leadership but also to the business world.  Take time to read this classic.	1
excellent  nineteen more words not required, all i need is my personal opinion of this product still need more words.  this form is why more products are not reviewed	1
Great book that you can apply to your everyday life. I highly recommend people read this at least twice! That way you can get a better understanding of it.	1
good read explains warfare up to today this is great know how for a lot of things in life not just warfare pick this book up if you even have half a brain.	1
A++ if you want a basic translation. For the price it was worth it.	1
Good book	1
Small and nice printing. I hope to memorize this book and use the wisdom written in this book.	1
what time you need to kill a small amount of years and I have no choice but to be fair years and the green bay packers are not too much you're to the yard and got it from a bit late to	1
This is a great book.  "The art of war" teaches us not to fight a war if it's not a sure-win.  The philosophy behinds this is to reserve the scarce resources and human lives, never fight a war on impulse.  Plan, calculate, and win.  If not a sure-win, diplomacy and negotiation are preferred.  The original "The Art of War" in Chinese was written in 5th century BC, had only thirteen chapters and about six thousand Chinese characters, not a huge book, but the content was time-tested, proven to be effective even nowadays.  Read it, you won't regret.	1
This is the best edition for easy understanding.  Principles are still relevant in todays world.  I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to read the "Art of War"	1
It was O.K. but not what I expected.  Maybe better for you.	1
Outstanding book as accurate today as it was 1000's of years ago.	1
yea	1
Good quick.!	1
Amazing book. I will definitely be keeping this on my shelf and reading it again and again for years to come.	1
I liked it very much.  Can apply much of what I read to different aspects of life.	1
book in very good condition just like represented.  thanks	1
The book is more like cliff notes.	1
Buy it. Read it. Apply it to your life	1
Historically, this is a timeless book on successfully fighting and strategically planning battles.	1
Its doesn't really tell you how to do anything its all just proverbs and rules. Dont waste your money.	0
This piece has survived through the ages as a testament to the persistence of human spirit. While long and challenging,,this book will enlighten you greatly. Enjoy! :)	1
I received this book today, in great condition and quite quickly, but it is not as described.  It is only a translation and without any commentary as is mentioned in the product description.	0
GREAT	1
great book	1
The Art of War is so applicable to so many aspects of life, you simply have to read it to appreciate it. It's a free download on Amazon's Kindle, too, so you can't go wrong there.	1
Kind of a cut down version but still a good read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to read.	1
Fascinating must read for every war/military buff	1
This is a masterpiece I will read, and re-read, and re-read, until it becomes instinctual.	1
MANY OF TODAYS MILITARIES HAVE THIS AS REQUIRED READING FOR THEIR OFFICERS, INSIGHT, COMMON SENSE AND GREAT STRATEGY, SFTER READING THIS, I IMPROVED MY CHESS GAME	1
This would be better for a solider.	1
The book is probably not as smoothly produced / edited as other versions of The Art of War.  Compare the presentation of a couple of versions before settling on the one that suits you best.	1
Great buy. Worth every penny.	1
I have read approximately 1/4 of the book and I like it very much.  I appreciate it since I served in the Military of the United States of America and a proud Veteran	1
damn when i read this book i feel like im in the war and im godmode everyone just can't kill me damn i so pro	1
NIce deal	1
Excellent book!  Truly a must read classic!	1
Wish I had this in the military!!	1
The concepts that are described in the writings of Sun Tzu work equally well in warfare and in business.	1
Learn what he knew thousands of years ago... applies to war, business and life.	1
I found large chunks of the book were missing in this format.  At the time I bought this, i didn't know how common this is in "public domain" works.	0
It is written as a war tactic manual by a couple thousand year old Chinese dude. Insert sarcasm after this point.	1
Basically a quick summary. gets to the point.	1
The Art of War - Kindle Edition ~ I have heard about the Art of War for some time now and decided to read it.  I am mostly through it and it is as much a life guide for those like Donald Trump or John D. Rockefeller to win at all costs as it is a guide to Warring.  It points out much as to how you should handle situations and like the bible for the needy, it is rather written as hyperbole and generalities of situations not a detailed explanation of each battle situation.  I really emphasizes deceit and distraction rather than actually just racing to battle.  Preparation and patience are also much of the emphasis.  It OK, but of course it is a basic primer.	1
I love this book!!!!	1
ok	1
Nice quality for a paperback.  Glossy cover and easy read font size.	1
Everybody should have the opportunity to read this book. It has been quoted by many people over the course of the years. Buy it and enjoy it	1
I read this in the bathroom when pooping. Get's the job done.	1
Contradictory instructions for how to win a military campaign.  Just about anything you do could be wrong or right.  Translation could have been much better.  If you are a military freak, it is a must read.	1
Over-hyped - not so great.	0
Item as described.Great price and great service!	1

Cliff notes version	0
Can learn so much from a classic <333	1
Recieved a highlighted copy.	0
it's Ok	1
Weird.	1
Smaller than I thought but great book fr	1
This book had tons of useful knowledge that I personally feel could be used in everyday life. How you tackle your problems head-on to how to avoid certain problems altogether. Great buy to better enrich your life as well as your thinking.	1
my own copy	1
Would give 0 stars if I could. Just a random persons clif notes summary. Do NOT buy.	0
It is good quality but i think some stuff is missing from the original. Also needs to be spell checked. I found some grammatical errors.	1
Perfect	1
A interesting description of the oriental mind and how it crafted the outcome of various wars. A primer for military students	1
All warfare is based on deception.	1
For anyone who wants to learn the history of warfare and strategies revolving around it, this is the book for you. Perfect for tacticians and strategists alike.	1
NOT ACTUAL BOOK.  Summary of book not the full text	0
This is not a book in the sense I thought it would be.  It looks like a cut/copy/paste of some content stapled inside a cheap cover.	0
Was pleasantly surprised when we got the book. It got here 2 days ahead if schedule and was new . Bought it as used if it is used who ever owned it never broke the spine.	1
Don't buy	0
Perhaps I have been spoiled by the James Clavell writing of this classic but I was less than impressed with this version it just didnt seem to have the feel I expected.	1
My order shipped on time, It was in good condition and the shopping cost was reasonable. The book itself was great. Although it was a coffee table version, the text was clear and the few illustrations were also clear.	1
Good book so far, however, I will say some of the vocabulary used stumped me a bit but the book overall is great!	1
Great book	1
Always a classic	1
I love these classic books!! They are timeless and never get old. Anyone can relate to the characters, and that's what makes them so amazing!!	1
classic book it iss a quick easy read and extremely insightful even with its age	1
Too many notes by the author. It breaks up the text too much. Great stuff, just poorly placed IMO. Ta-da!	1
100%	1
Can be more concise, overall good book	1
NOT THE FULL BOOK , VERY MISLEADING , NOT COOL	0
For business, for everyday life, and more... I evaluated this book with a 5 star because I have been using the suggestion it's giving in real life. And it's certainly help. At least it's helps you to make a decision, promptly.	1
Great book....	1
An excellent book on strategic planning that can be applied to your daily life in work or dealing with people.	1
Good Book	1
This is an excellent edition and translation of this classic. The forward's essay is essential to contextualize The Art of War and its philosophical context, and the words of Sun Zi are followed by notes from well-known strategists.	1
Book is total BS!!!!  This is nothing more than a summary at best of Sun Tzu writings.  It was a waste of money and I would advise any person to be dilligent in verifying what you are buying.	0
If you want to study Sun Tzu's philosophy this is not the book to order.  The worst translation I've ever seen.	0
I thought this was by Sun Tzu	0
Short book and to the point just like I like it. A wealth of information that you can use in other areas of your life.	1
I should have checked but I was really disappointed that the book was so incredibly thin. For the price, I can't really complain.	1
Solid advice that lasts throughout the centuries - unfortunately this advice comes from a monster of barbaric proportions.	1
Interesting. Thanks fast service	1
A very good version of the manuscript. Sincerely, Terrence W.	1
Hubby loves it!	1
Great book I recommend it for anyone who likes to learn about the real world.	1
The "First Thus edition" from Filiquarian publishing is a terrible translation. I suspect they used Google Translate with a bit of help from a human. (They don't even list the translator.) As another reviewer pointed out, it reads like those terrible instructions you get in cheap Chinese products. This book (as with many historical books) is difficult to shop for on Amazon. I'm headed to my local B&N to flip through different translations.	0
Buyer beware! This is not the actual book. It is a scam!	0
Great	1
one of many books that teaches how we should live our lives	1
It's a book that can be applied to far more than war.  One of a very small selection of books that I keep re-reading.  Besides, I couldn't beat the price.	1
The strategies taught apply to everything in life, business and work. So basically it teaches how to strategize properly. It is a must read.	1
More people should read this book in today's society!!!	1
It’s a great book. It teaches you a lot of different materials. I just wanted to read it. I had heard good reviews about it so I wanted to see for myself	1
amazeballs	1
I had to study sections of this in the US Army, while training to work in Military Intelligence.	1
You be ashamed of yourself.  Very misleading.  Do not buy.	0
Great book.  A must read.  So many modern day correlations	1
I now know how to defeat my enemies	1
It met my expectations. There was great ancient incite between the covers.	1
Its a lot smaller then I though it would be, I thought it would be the full book. But that is probably my fault for not reading all the information.	1
Very nice classic book! Everyone should read this book!! I like this book a lot, but i also like 48 laws of power better!	1
Thanks	1
Great vision of an ancient warrior. While a number of his thoughts are common sense he has had the forsight to put them all into practice which has made him China's greatest General. reat read	1
Great book to live life by. You can read a page  a day and apply it to your personal and professional  life  situations.	1
An excellent book that has application to the business world, life and military as well.	1
Amazing book with great insight! Thankful that I read it!	1
Thank you very much	1
anybody with an ambition to excel at almost anything should read this book.. its not a narrative, and can be read in small amounts without the danger of missing something.. just some very interesting, and widely applicable, anecdotes and philosophies..	1
A must	1
Awesome Book	1
very good reed book came fast and in great shape very happy lot of help full think came from this book that can be applied to life it self !	1
I have never been to war. So I would never stand in judgment of those who have .  Fundamental and sound strategies-	1
Condensed version, don't waste your money.	0
Four stars due to the translation which was a little sloppy. Otherwise, an interesting read that I always thought about reading.	1
Wow this is a fantastic little book! I'm so happy it found its way to me!	1
It's ok. I am sure he was way before his time.	1
My expectations were way too high when I ordered this book, so I was somewhat disappointed. Not that its a bad book. I just expected something different. Keep an open mind.	1
. . . not like the book. The CD left out too much information. Too expensive for one CD.	0
I bought this book 8 years ago and to this day I still read it, it has really helped me with my life tactics in business and work.	1
Great book! No wonder it's among the books that all managers have to read. Absolutely recommended to anyone who wants to learn to rule their life.	1
I finally ran out of excuses for not having a dead tree copy of this.	1
This is a work that changes each time you read it. The text doesn't necessarily change, but you change your interpretation each time.	1
Just as described.	1
A classic.  Each translation a little different.  Each reading reveals something previously unseen.	1
It's the art of war .enough said.	1
Any and everyone interested in leadership should read this book.  The situations addressed in the book can be applied to all kinds of situations in war, in business, in leading any body and in many other facets of life.	1
It's simply put together, this is a must read staple.	1
Great book. A must read.	1
Just as applicable today (if not more so) as when it was written 2000 years ago.  Some great quotes throughout	1
Although written thousands of years ago, it's relevant today	1
I love the size of book and the various Chinese illustrations inside that mark the beggining of a chapter	1
I was hoping for something that was more readable and understandable. I thought that this book provided strategies in short form but it does not.	0
Great read	1
war is deception	1
Not the entire book, more like a summary.	0
its cheap because it is some sort of reduced size reprint. Guess it is nice to carry around as it is small.	1
Cant get enough of this.. wonderful read	1
Classic book on war to help you in business.	1
Great, thanks	1
40 page, short version	0
Excellent book. I recommend it to anyone in a leadship role. In fact, I have recommended to my friends, when we often get into those heated political discussions.	1
It is a really good translation.	1
Great buy, learning alot!!!	1
Awesome!!!	1
Great Classic to read.	1
Interesting read, not too dense but full of unique viewpoints to consider.	1
Great	1
Great book! Very dense, and the lessons contained within still applies to today.	1
It came quickly. No shipping with prime.  The product was described correctly. I would buy again. A must read. Useful for a lot of things in life.	1
GREAT PRICE AND A LOT CHEAPER THEN STORE...	1
interesting book	1
A must have for any book shelf! Nice short timeless quips of knowledge.	1
Just wow	1
With this guide, I was able to defeat all of my enemies except one, otherwise 5 stars.	1
The art of war the best strategist book	1
Everyone should read this book.	1
Excellent!	1
needed another copy, so went for Kindle edition	1
A must read very political leader and military personnel and anyone interested in the logic of battle.	1
as described	1
I purchased this as something that i would look at over time to see the principles noted.  I know some business people who have read this so I was interested.  It's OK..	1
This was the real deal unlike some other for sale on Amazon. It makes a great gift for any history buff or any manly man!	1
I recommend that everyone pick-up this book!!	1
Well edited version of Sun Tzu's writing. Product came as described and on time. No complaints.	1
It's an old book to that I was required to read. Its not something I would  pay to read again but worth the a first time read.	1
read read read! just do	1
Read this as an assignment. Great read. Is still used as an aide for some military and businesses.	1
I thought this was the whole real book no it's not it's just quotes. Bamboozled don't buy!	0
A very old book its content is taught in all our military war colleges	1
I first read this classic text in hard copy and purchased this kindle version to have as a ready reference.  I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the editing and formatting of this kindle edition.  This version contains no chapter stops and has numerous flaws including but not limited to inconsistent indentations, Incomplete paragraph breaks and the use of "-" instead of proper horizontal line breaks. The text itself is little changed from the translation made a hundred year ago (as I believe it should be).  My negative rating on this book is restricted to the poor presentation on kindle and if it is fixed and uploaded to my kindle I would be happy to change my rating.	0
I can't wait to read it. It came right on time along with some other ones that I ordered	1
Gift for a friend who loves it-it's a classic.	1
smart man great wisdom for any country or marriage	1
great read	1
Good read but needed to ask questions to get an understanding about his principals...Still growing lol!!!	1
perfect	1
Nice font size, well constructed paperback.	1
Chapter One is the most important, after that, it's a bit monotonous. An interesting and quick, short read.	1
While this book's title suggests that it's for war, it's been used in business for decades as the source for smart business leadership.	1
Exactly what I wanted.	1
challenged my perspectives	1
Always good to have a copy of this classic around!	1
Just buy it.  It's that insightful and you can quickly apply it's logical to just about any situation in your life.	1
One of the Classics	1
Great book and not adulterated by biased publishers	1
Small book, more like a pamphlet, but very well made and helpful.	1
Good reading that it can be related to every day life as how to treat people and what to spect from them	1
I have read and referenced this book several times in my life. If you are one of the few that have not read this, it is time.	1
Exactly as described, Very happy.	1
Very impactful, well written and intelligent... A good book for men ,women and older children , alike.... A MUST read..	1
Top notch.	1
This is not the real book, it's just a 20 pages of it, or maybe not I have no idea	0
This is not the full book. It's only excerpts & that's not what I was looking for. For the price I expected the full book,	0
I like the way it's laid out and seems like a very good reproduction of a classic text.	1
Enjoyed it. Read it in small chunks at a time. Good advice that can be applied to the business world.	1
Must read for anyone serious	1
Just as advertised, Happy with product	1
Historically significant, and definitely worth reading.	1
Words to live by	1
Very informative and enlightening methods of war for that time in history.	1
Overall simple read. I would recommend to anyone.  Useful in life, business, war, and romance.  Noticed a few typos and probably some mistranslations.  However nothing terribly distracting.	1
I found this book to be full of good advice that you can incorporate into your everyday life. (within reason, lol) This book doesn't read like an ordinary book, it reads like Proverbs.	1
Good overview of common sense military tactics. Often quoted in military circles, yet not implemented as often as it should be. Book is alright, just dated a little and probable should only be used as a primer or beginning step. The world may have changed a bit since this was written, but the human element has not. Take this as a beginning step only. The book should be owned by every member of the military, law enforcement, salesmen, and those that enter into negotiations.	1
just highlights of the original book.  very bland	0
A classic that I got for free with kindle.  For that price, who could say no?  Interesting little book that I read back in college.	1
Excellent Book gone Audio! Cant get any better than this! There is so much to learn in this book and now you can listen to it!	1
I highly recommend reading this book.	1
Spot on	1
you figure it out	1
This is a "must read" for anyone going into a combat situation. Although written long ago thhe tactics of war and the rules of victory have not changed. This book is not only for the combat bound soldier, many  of its faacts can be appllied to life in general.	1
A short read, interesting.  Not a lot of depth.  But clear wisdom gathered by mistakes	1
The real deal.  Tons of good information to help you better understand what it takes to actually keep a fighting army in the field.	1
Nothing more, nothing less than expected.	1
I was expecting this to be much longer. This is a series of excerpts. If you're looking for a more detailed translation of the full book go for the one by Ralph D. Sawyer.	0
Its a very old book...interesting read...but it has been around so long that you cant discredit its credentials as being a good book	1
Very interesting for someone with military experience.	1
Great, classic book on strategy. Everyone should have a read of this at least once.	1
This is a classic and must read for high energy business people.	1
Good book. I bought out for my husband and he liked it.	1
One of the best books ever written	1
My husband loves this.	1
Expected the full book, this is a summary of sorts. I should have checked the page count. Oops	1
Sunzi is a genius.  Run your life based on this book and you will come out on top or at least not get run over by the competition.	1
Replaced this book for one I had years ago and gave away.	1
This is  a great book, able to be applied to most of life. Work, family, friends. I will certainly re-read it.	1
Very practical tips that will last for ever.Knowing yourself is the essence of all wisdom,and combine that with knowing your enemy to achieve success.	1
Enlightening war strategy	1
I don't read too many books anymore, since my vision's gotten worse,  but this book is a must read for everyone	1
Just what I was looking for.	1
This is a very good read. I can recommend this to anyone that would like to gain the insights of Sunzi	1
Perfect transaction	1
It's a must read for anyone in military, business or any leadership role. Actually everyone should read it.	1
this is a gift for an employee, this is my favorite translation of the art of war	1
Hype Aside... An interesting read from days of Oriental Yore. An amazing glimpse of that epoch.	1
Very good book	1
Greatest Combat book available	1
Standard reading in war colleges and always worth referring back to for understanding of warfare.	1
This is not the book by Sun Tzu. It is summary notes by someone who read it.	0
no blemishes, thank you	1
Excellent product	1
Ready to go to war at the office, with my friends, or on the actual battlefield. A great book showcasing how to be victorious!	1
What is best way to learn? How about from the master if its good enough for officers in the military good enough for me.	1
This is not the actually book it’s just notes be aware	0
The information is awesome.  The writing is stiff and requires focus and determination to read.  A war bible for every walk of life.	1
too much history and too many forgettable names I was more interested in the meat of the philosophy of Sun Tzu	1
Insightful.	1
I can see that many that have done well throughout time,started with many of the ideas in this book	1
Seriously it does not start that this is a summary!!!!  don't by this unless you want the notes	0
Another foray into the philosophy of war.  Still don't think it should be the way humanity continues to go, when there are excellent alternatives.  Received in good condition.	1
Wanted to read this ever since I saw it mentioned on "Thirtysomething."	1
Enlighten	1
I see this book as more of a philosophy. The contents can be applied to many situations in life, not just war.	1
Excellent	1
Im going to be much more difficult to argue with now!  GRRRRR!!	1
hard to read	1
A good read even if your not in business, a book to read over again from time to time to gain insights and stratagies  for dealing with people in all aspects of life.	1
Timeless classic.  I learn something new every time I read it.	1
Great if you want to read one passage a day. It might be cheaper to buy a WU-TANG cd and listen to one song a day.	0
This is not what I actually wanted and it is a bit childish but gets the point across. Learn to be the enemy	1
Simple and to the point.	1
A must read book for all strategists, not just for soldiers and generals.  Use it in marketing, management, and even in love	1
This is a classic. Considering war as an art, it goes much further. A real teaching on thinking. Timeless. A must.	1
Great book	1
ok	1
It's not hard to understand why this book is a classic.  The Art of War is the art of success.	1
Very abstract, but a great book indeed.	1
I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie. Besides a good classic is hard to pass up.	1
A classic.	1
Got this for my nephew. He is already changing his outlook	1
This is an absolute classic that any business man or woman should read.	1
Exactly as described!  Great product, shipping and all around experience!!!  Highly recommend!!!	1
This book has lots of practical advice for any who have an ear to hear it.  It is relatively short, and the book is written in short tidbits that are easy to digest.	1
Thank you so much for the timely delivery. Thank you so much for the great service and great product!!! A+++	1
The Art of War, if you're going to buy it no comment or review is going to stop you.  Enjoy the book.	1
Great	1
great book and it's great on the kindle.  i love how the kindle makes the books so interactive.  i definitely recommend the book.	1
Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it	1
The format is NOT the best... Content is OK. I'd not buy it from Amazon again...	1
Great	1
great for business too	1
This is not the book, it is a summary. A bad one. Not worth the money	0
A good and interesting read. The content is definitely applicable to multiple spheres of life. Leaders will greatly benefit from reading this book.	1
Didn’t know I was ordering a shortened version 👎🏻	0
As described and expected.	1
literary masterpiece for free on your mobile device, if you complain you will just sound spoiled and dumb, so don't	1
Love this book and would recommend for all, especially managers.	1
Essential reading for those interested in military tactics. It reminded me again how tied we are to ancient ideas.	1
This was actually the first time I read this book, I'm very glad I got it, and the ebbok format is very convenient.	1
The principles in this book can be applied to many areas of life. Solid book, quick read. Would recommend to anyone.	1
Great! Thanks!	1
Great condition	1
Cheap and arrived in a timely fashion. The product is great and works well, I would do business again with this seller.	1
Good	1
Bit disappointing compared to the quality of the ones I saw at B&N and Costco after the purchase.	1
Thought this was the full book.	0
This book allows me to see things differently when it comes to handling small to big scale conflict.	1
thanks, my son loves it	1
Great Book	1
Good to read on the train to and from home.	1
Classic book and it was free.  What else do people want.  Beggars can't be choosers (that's what my Ma always said).	1
very good item, like all SUnzi  products, the quality of the materials give a you a mark of resistence and durability	1
Great!	1
Much better than hardcover copy from book store	1
This is a satisfactory book but the translation could be more precisely done in English. The book is good enough for general information but I felt a little more background would have been of help.	1
You never know what tactic will come next!	1
I originally purchased multiple copies of this translation as a going-away present for a couple of coworkers, and I was so impressed with the quality of the translation and the simple, unembroidered way that it was presented that I am going to order an additional copy for myself within the next week.	1
Great read and relevant to today's world. Excellent Kindle version making all of this work readily accessible.  Thumb's up!!!	1
Very wise tactical methods which stand the test of time.	1
ok	1
Nothing special here. Just a good bound version of an already classic work. For the price, this is worth picking up and having in your literary arsenal.	1
Just needed a back up or extra to give someone, works perfect.	1
this book is for everyone that wants to learn the art of strategy and organization. Although written for war the book can be easily used in everyday business situations. The only drawback with the book is it was written in Chinese so translation can sometimes seem a little confusing. Some parts I had to re-read twice in order to understand what was being said.	1
This is a staple in his education.  He wants to go into the military and appreciates it's references for school.	1
The Art of War read less about the acts of war and more how to conduct ones self in life matters. U Yes there are specific points of how to attack and from where, but by the time it is completed it felt more like is was giving life lessons as well. I thought it odd and inspiring in a way that the author could merge these thoughts rather the solely concentrate on how to kill your enemy. I'll be reading it again.	1
Not the full book, don’t waste your money	0
Thought there was more to it.	1
Short, sweet and to the point.  Very useful in business.  I love the audio book and the written book.  I would buy it again.	1
I was taking a philosophy class at college and had to write some papers. These proved to be helpful during the class.	1
About what I expected. Interesting reading!	1
great book !!	1
Good book,liked reading  !...	1
Bought for my 17 year old son,he had to read it for school and he loved it. He said it was the best book.	1
The only downside of this book is the fact that every newly minted MBA-turd quotes it.	1
I use this book to defeat all of my enemies and so far I have destroyed them all!  Works best as a club from behind!	1
Makes you think of life and how society has came a long way. These ideas are the foundation for years to come.	1
This book is very helpful for students studying political science, history, business, criminal justice or even understand terrorism. The Art of War was mentioned numerous times in my understanding terrorism course and is very helpful to understand techniques that guerrilla and terrorist groups have used from the book.	1
Recommend for anyone that wants to learn about the military ideas or plans that are required to win a war.	1
Pleased with the service and product.	1
Timeless reading never outdated	1
This book is a way to learn how to deal with other and life itself!!	1
Its for school	1
Life wisdom....great book.	1
great book	1
A classic. Very helpful I all walks of life.	1
An all-time classic on strategy.  I found the new content to be somewhat esoteric and just skipped all the parts in the brackets.	1
Excellent!	1
One of the greatest books I have ever read on strategy and tactics. I really like it.	1
These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.	1
Only 20 pages long. Not the real book.	0
not the real book just an over priced cliff notes bur it did arrive quickly	0
Interesting read, you can learn some things from it.	1
Basis of practically all military policies throughout history.	1
Very happy with this book, no regrets, money well spent. Should have bought this books months ago. Nothing like a good book .	1
I thought it was the original thick book but it was the new short book	1
very nice book.	1
Great book - excellent gift.	1
This is the bible on warfare and it is timeless! Small but great book. I'm very glad it's still available.	1
Really just a bunch of quotes, it's an alright book but nothing to wow me.	0
Great book, glad I finally replaced my original copy.	1
thanks	1
Very nice read applicable to setting strategy and tactics whether in war, sports, business, or politics.  I found it meaningful to identify analogies for some of the truths that are outdated.	1
Rip off!!! This is not the full book	0
Great Book . Very good book for moving your life along in a positive way. A good read for anyone.	1
Great book, quick read that’s very interesting.	1
Already good at the beginning. The points are valid.	1
I read it to help me with my poker game. It can be helpful in any type of leadership role.	1
Good advice for anyone. Applicable for everyday life.	1
Classic.	1
I have to agree with the review that I read before I purchased the book. The author really does not know when to shut up.  The Art of War and other works from Asia (allow me to recommend Go Rin No Sho by Miyamoto Musashi) really benefit from some perspective and discussion from the translator.  I get that. This guy has to interject his thoughts right in the middle of the source work. Often his thoughts are many times longer than the text that is the focus of his ramblings. But don't be dissuaded from taking on this master piece because of this, after a few moments you will learn how to skip the blather (the first quarter of the book and then sometimes 2 &  3 pages at a time) and read the book as translated.  On the second read through maybe the third,  go ahead and enjoy what our author has to share. His perspective is not bad,  but the book is an editorial nightmare.	0
Nice to have on kindle fire.	1
This was too short and was misleading, it did not indicate the length of the CD.  The original book is very lengthy.	0
good reading for the mind.	1
Excellent.	1
Classic Novel that should be read by anyone looking for an advantage in life	1
Great deal for the price	1
This is an amazing book!  It has lived up to all of my expectations.  My husband hates to read but he read this book and loved it!  Very very Good Book.	1
Good	1
This very condensed version of Sun Tzu's The Art of War would be better as a pocket version for quick reference.	0
This is not the original Art of War by Sun Tzu as I thought it was and the picture indicates.	0
Good book.	1
I am kind of torn on how many stars to give this as the product itself (the audio book) is great, but the actual content is retarded. Sun Tzu spouts off a bunch of useless crap like: "If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive." Thank you Sun Tzu, for summarizing war into neat little equations for us: Function for computing losses during outmaneuver operation: F(x) = (if x = 50 then 1 leader and 0.50 of force else if x = 0.333 then 0.6667 of force)	1

The Art of War provides a timeless framework for evaluating adversaries in conflicts.	1
Do not buy the Filiquarian Publishing version.  The translation is poor as well as the editing.  It reminds me of reading unintelligible assembly instructions for foreign products You will not enjoy reading this book. It is a great book but not this version.	0

What you see is what you get, great product, the same as in the detail, I recommend this Item to everyone.	1
Audio is a bit stiff, but the book is great.	1
Most people go through life using tactics. While Sun Tzu does give great tactical advice, he also show in this book that having an overall strategy is the key to success.  It is a military guide, but after all isn't life a war?  Great book and if can learn to apply to your world, you'll find yourself with a very different outcome than usual.  Success for the long run.	1
Purchased for a class and it was exactly what I needed.	1
I enjoyed reading this simple and to the point translated version of the book. The translated text of The Art of War means that the meaning of the words have further been interpreted for the English language. It allows therefore the reader to interpret also the words for the modern day context of daily life.	1
It was good reading. Short and concise for the price.	1
I can't get my husband to join me using this product with an e reader. With the book it's great	1
i thought it would be better but it is still a good read.	1
This is one of those classic must read books. It has been around for ages and for good reason too.	1
Great product.	1
amazing price	1
Good	1
Don't remember a thing about this book.	1
A gift and it was used, not much else to say, if you like the book, this will be used	1
as expected	1
A very insightful book that can be taken metaphorically as well as literally. This books reads in a number format that simply gives tips on warfare.	1
Who doesn’t love this book?	1
it should say in the title that this is a small version without commentary. only 60 pages or so.	1
Well packaged, fast delivery. Thx.	1
This book is a necessary read for all students of history.  This is a manual for life, read it carefully to digest all that is written.  Because it is ancient and translated it may be a little difficult to understand at first, but take your time and enjoy! Rev. Sandra Spencer Abbey of Avalon	1
Gave as a gift to my wife and she loved it.	1
This book is a definitely must read. Each statement makes you think.	1
Excellent bare bones version of the classic.  No commentary etc.  Just the original book	1
I have read or attempted to read several versions and this is one of the best lay outs that I have read.	1
Actually,it's enough to attract me.	1
This was a written around the 5th or 6th century B.C. by Sun Tzu, one of the most powerful Chinese generals of that era. Spoken basically like proverbs, he gives a general overview of conducting war. I didn't care for the commentaries, that went with it, but I absolutely LOVED the thoughts of Sun Tzu. Not only does it open your eyes to the fact that warfare is more than what occurs on the battlefield, but also the tactic that the enemy uses against us.	1
Very pleased	1
I consider this book because fundamentals of war it describes, is on point. As I am reading I visualized the plots taking place. When I was I reading the book drew me in and I wanted more.	1
We love it, just what we ordered.	1
Great book	1
A pure masterpiece written by, arguably, the greatest military mind that ever has walked this planet. I will read his over and over.	1
great book	1
War. When to do it, why to do it, how to do it. A step by step instruction manual on how to wreak havoc and influence people. If you enjoy war as much as I do, this is a must read.	1
Good philosophy to follow.	1
I can't really review books that well since books come in various tastes, but if you're looking to catch up on the classics for fun or  because it's on your bucket list, I'd strongly recommend you pick this up.	1
Good reading to fill a few minutes here and there.  How can you complain about a free e-book? ? ?	1
GREAT BOOK. DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER, & GREAT PRICE!	1
Must have	1
Great history book	1
A classic. The foreword is a wonderful read.	1
good read	1
Meh, I thought most of this was just common sense.	0
Tried a couple other well known versions of Sun Tzu's book and they don't stand up to Clave's edit.	1
It's the art of war	1
Book ended up being just the cliffnotes, I though I was getting the whole book.  Probably missed that in the product description.  It still let me get a decent idea of what the book was about, but it was a pretty quick read.	1
Great book as a gift!	1
It's Sun Tzu...	1
Excellent summary of warfare.  Today, tomorrow, and yesterday.	1
* Cheap binding * Cheap paper * Poor translation * Typesetting looks like it was done in Notepad * Lots of grammatical errors * Paragraphs not laid out correctly I bought this for my father as a Christmas gift and was taken aback at the low quality of this product. Seems like it was self-published or similar. Would NOT recommend.	0
Must read for business	1
Great advice for today.	1
I've read it six times. Each time I get something out of it.	1
Kind of a dry read for my taste but with good content. Many items are there for review and application to extended ideas.	1
Ok, but dated.	1
Its not an accident that this wisdom has been passed down through the ages. The philosophy can be applied to just about any area of life!	1
Very good experience  . . . would defintely order from Vendor again .  . . . . . . . .	1
Found it for free - not really an easy read, but a good read.	1
The introduction is the best part of this book. I think that's the closest you can get to a biography of Sunzi, so that's good. But the book itself is very confusingly formatted. The organization is completely unclear; it does not read like a text so much as a list. There are so many additions and footnotes that it is not clear where Sunzi ends and where  Cleary begins.	0
A Classic.  Rereading it is always a gaining of new insights.	1
While reading the art of war, I immediately realized the influence this book has said not only in military strategy but also in business. The strategies mentioned in the book has been repeated throughout history and I enjoyed that the Chinese General was very straightforward in good descriptions. No sugar coding, no complex metaphors, is all black and white and its up to the reader to form hisher opinion on it. I'm positive many corporate tycoons used the strategies for corporate takeovers and countries have used the book as a way to win wars and sack cities. This can be pretty dangerous season in the wrong hands so I recommend anyone in a leadership position to delve into this short but concise book for a few hours.	1
Exactly what I paid for	1
read it again!  easy in my spare time on my phone	1
I would recomend this to anyone who wants to succeed in anything they do, It is not just about lessons in war but can be used and applied for everyday life. Great buy! God bless!	1
Great product.  Exactly as described.  Fast shipping. A+++	1

Some great advice in here. The whole book is literally aphorism after aphorism.	1
Every military person should read this	1
I may have ordered the wrong version of this book because it was not at all what I expected.	0
I received Thomas Cleary's translation of Sun Tzu's "Art of War" in a trouble free, very timely fashion, for a great price.  When it arrived, I found the book in excellent condition, which is good as I bought the book brand new.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with the purchase.	1
Good resource for most Social Studies Classrooms	1
Good book about strategy.	1
I am a military person, and I have read it many times.  Every time I read it, I find information that I that I have not found before.	1

Great read!	1
Bought The Art of War paperback as part of a stocking stuffer set. Did not realize my son has a Hard Bound copy from years ago. He still loves this one as he can take it when he has to go somewhere he knows he'll have to sit/stand and wait.	1
My expectations were met	1
What would Sun Tzu think about his book being rated on Amazon? He would probably have something really wise to say.	1
Have read before several times and given away my copy.  This one will Be kept and given to s grandson when old enough.  The world is not all seashells and balloons and critical thinking needs to be taught	1
Everyone should have a copy of this classic around to glance at occasionally.  I suspect it still is a textbook at West Point.	1
Really good book i have read it so many times	1
The Arts should be studied	1

good book would recommend this to anyone to read. very interesting subject have read a couple times now. hard to put down	1
This book is relevant for today's tactics. The principles are timeless. This book should be required reading for anyone in leadership.	1
A good read.	1
A very interesting read. Can be a little stale if you aren't into tactics on the battlefield. Otherwise a nice treatise on the tactics used in war, during Sun Tzu's time.	1
Good all around.	1
Great book for life & business.	1
One of the best strategic books I've ever read in my life; The lessons in this book are applicable to every aspect in life.	1
A must read.	1
An easy read with a lot of sensible information. Helps to give insight for strategic actions that may be employed in both life and war.	1
I was very surprised that the story for the most part is mostly intact.  How hard is it to get the Art of war right?  I did feel that some of the softening of the language was not necessary and I believe a strait translation would have gone a long way in bringing this book back to the iconic level it has enjoyed all these years.	1

you get what you pay for and this one is a great value.  Can't say that I've read it yet, but at least I have it now.	1
its a book	1
It's alright. I consider it a good beginning but further reading required. Warfare is a subject  more complex than meets the eye. There's no substitute for experience.	1
Great Book!	1
Printing quality average, very short read	1
Do not buy. Table of contents is mixed around and the actually content is not the real book, just bullet points for several chapters.	0
THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING WORK.  I THINK IT REFLECTED NOT ONLY ON WAR BUT ON HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES AND RELATE TO LIFE'S SITUATIONS AND CHALLENGES.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. AN EASY READ, WELL DIVIDED BY CHAPTERS AND PARAGRAPHS.	1
Don't want to write a review.	1
This isn't a book. It's a handbook. Reference material, to be used when conducting warfare. Sun Tzu was thousands of years ahead of his time. Anybody with even a remote interest in military tactics needs to read this book.	1
U can appley these lessons in every day life. The lessons in this book will give u disipline in every walk of life. Sun Tzu teachings are timeless	1

Great read. Should (if it isn't already) be required reading for all college students. The Art of War is a suggestive manual on combat by Sun Tzu that can easily be looked upon as a guide in the world today.	1
Can't beat the classics.	1
It has some colourful use of language and some of the leadership principles might intrigue you, but mostly it's just outdated war principles and following most of what's in here in real life would be silly.	1
Great Product Thank You	1

Awesome and classic book	1

Great item, Great Price, Amazon does it again.... I never have to leave the house to shop again. thank you	1
awesome book.	1
Good product	1
Rating says it all!!!	1
The worst part of this book is that the print is off center and lopsided like it wasn't printed correctly. If you're like me then you can look past that and just enjoy the book, which is entirely legible. Also, the book has no printing on the end...which makes it hard to see on a book shelf. Not that big of a deal to me because I know where it is and lets honest...that's all that matters! If however you are one of those pretentious douche-bags that likes showing off just cultured you are, you might want to go with a copy that someone might enter your room, see it and think to them self, "gee, I hope their greatness rubs off on me."	0
Excellent book. It arrived on time!	1
Came quickly and it will make a great gift for my teenage son.	1
standard ,  useful,  timeless wisdom	1
Different from what I expected and loved the strategies. Shows me that everything has to be analytical in business, war, or any other thing	1
Good	1
Highly recommend this!	1
I have study the art of war from a tv point of view!! never read the book from this author!! I did look at a page or so and I thinks any and everyone who deals with life can learn from this book and help them with life problems and situations. if the book meet what I seen on tv it will meet my expectations  and more.   thanks for reading my review and more!!	1
Very enlightening...	1
Loved it!	1
Great book...Great seller!	1
good read	1
A must read for everyone.	1
Dood! This is like... TOTALLY a copy of The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Totally!	1
It was a very short read, with many war strategies that can be applied to typical daily decisions we all encounter. More enriched from reading this book.	1
The first quarter of the book is all introductions and someone's essay on the life of Sun Zhu. The rest of it you have to suffer through the editor's notes and opinions ever other paragraph. I would rather pay to not have to deal with it than to get it free and suffer through it. I expect it to be a good read and nothing against the book but those version is garbage.	0
Hard read!! Great strategic planning when it comes to war planning, can be useful in so many ways outside of war. Business, leagal matters, etc. Worth the hour it took to read!!	1
excellent	1
Delivered as expected	1
I mean there was a lot of hype surrounding this book but I found it to be very cryptic.  Yes, if you really think about it you can make sense of what the author was saying.  I feel like a wealthy famous individual say said this book was great so other people said it was great which started a trend... I bet if the Kardashians all the fashion bloggers in the world would post a pic with this book saying they loved it.  Buy the book for looks, people love to ask about it when they see it, not to read.	1
Everything as advertised...	1
A timeless classic...	1
This book was forced on me by Kindle. There is no way to remove it so it sits here taking up space. Amazon's response, "We will let the developers know." There are 5 books that came with the Kindle app that I cannot remove in total. None are useful or interesting.	0
This book was for my veteran son and he thoroughly enjoys and learns from the teachings of the book.  He has already gone through the battle, blown up and (thank God) survived.  This book not only teaches skills of war, but skills of life.	1

Many who I have spoken to have only seen this book as a military guide.  This is not the case, strategy is usable in all aspects of life and after reading this I gained a better understanding of how some things within the world work.  A great business strategy guide.	1

not as in depth as expected	1

the classic.	1
good book with notes	1
Just what I needed	1
It's a good read, that can be applied to life. Especially in the work place but it may take some think as to how to apple some tactics.	1
This book is a poorly edited, and completely plagiarized copy of Clavell's work.  I read the first page, discovered more spelling errors than you could imagine, and noticed almost immediately it was almost a word for word copy of Clavell's edition of THE ART OF WAR.  I sent it back the same day. Amazon was great about it.	0
Acceptable.	1
Free download!	1
It is what it is!	1
Simply affordable and digestable. If you spend 1 hour, you are able to complete it with ease. I caution however you have to read the content and try to see how you can apply it in your own lives.	1
I bought this for my son and he loves it.	1

Very interesting ideas. It's quick and to the point, and will leave you with lots of new knowledge that you can use in life.	1
The strategies in this book can be used in modern life. The author was an excellent thinker. Great book to reference.	1
It's an interesting book that was written in something like 1400 BC.  This is considered a loose translation of the original and has been condensed down into basic understandings about how to win wars.  It would be a quick read.  It's a brutal topic, imo.	0
Expensive!	1
Book comes as described	1
Great book !	1
A classic. Must have.	1
good book	1
Sometimes it was a bit confusing but, it still holds true for today. This just goes to show that the art of war never changes only the technology that we use to get the same outcome.	1
Not its best translation.  I felt something was missing.	1
Written thousands of years ago, still true today as it was then. Well translated and interesting. Highly recommended even though war as a whole is discouraged :-)	1
great	1
everyone should read this, if only for the modern day references.  The simplicity and common sense approach can appear boring until you apply it to other areas of your life.	1
On time delivery, arrived just as advertised.	1
A must read for someone in the business world.	1
Good Book!	1

Everyone in the military, civilian business sector, as well as mentors and coaches should read this book. The information relayed in this book can, and should, be implemented throughout all aspects of leadership training.	1

Good	1
Arrived looking and smelling like a brand new book!	1
Obviously a great collection in this book. You can dispute the greatness of Art Of War. Nothing I can say will add to it's historical importance...too many different philosophies.	1
One of the must read books on my list	1
good book	1
I like the tactics of management in this book	1
The Art of War audio book is read by B.D. Wong and Ron Silver.  Ron Silver has a really calm yet serious reading voice.	1
Sun Tzu often wrote about the importance of strategy and the wisdom that he shared is still extremely applicable today whether you’re referring to business, sports, or military endeavors.	1
I’m winning already	1
nice	1
if you want to succeed in this world you need to read and  practice what is written in this book	1
Very recommended book, easy to apply to present time. Great insights about a great leader, and qualities to lead people.	1
cool super nice reader and easy ro to follow good translation into English I enjoy this book. great book to read	1
This translation has many typos and errors. Very sloppy. Find a different translation for this excellent text	1
I purchased this book as a gift.  However, it is a wonderful & instrumental read for those of us who prefer peace than war.	1
Chapter 9 was in the wrong place in the book instead if in between 8 and 10 it was in between four and 6.	0
Very Informative Book. Would Recommend That You Buy it. Information In Here Is Very Valuable	1
enjoyed it !	1
Enjoyed it. Recommended to business students	1
Wasn't what I was expecting, the book is just a list of quotes. However I'm glad to have read it and can mark it off my list!	1
I think this book could have been translated better.	0
I had always heard of this and finally got to read it.  very interesting. I heard that it is still used today and understand why. He is as much shrink as warrior.	1
this is a good translation of the art of war.	1
Not what I expected. Maybe let others know this is a very abbreviated "cliff-notes"version of the book!	0
Great read.	1
A must read for anyone interested in strategy. It's a classic!	1
Love being able to read on the go. The ease of the kindle is so nice. Would definitely recommend to buy.	1
The book is based on opinion of translations	1
Okay, I don't really know what I was expecting but I did not find it. I don't think I was expecting so much regurgitation of the orginal material.	1
I believe that our civilization is advanced beyond the need for war. This book is one of my best arguments against war.	1
love having this on my phone	1
THE GREAT CLASSIC IS PROUDLY IN MY LIBRARY ONCE ADAIN. THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO WISHES TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIER DESTINY. SUN TZU STRATEGIMS ARE AS TIMELES TODAY AS WHEN THEY WERE WRITTEN.THIS CLASSIC HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO MORE THAN 100 LANGAGUES AND IS PART OF THE CURRICULUM IN EVERY MILITARY SCHOOL THAT CONSIDERS ITSELF A VIABLE MILITARY.	1
A Classic read	1
love it	1
book is perfect, fast shipping, thanks so much!	1
i have been searching for this item for quite some time. finally found it here at amazon. as described,fast shipping, exactly what i was looking for, very nice item, thanks so much	1
very interesting	1
The book was not bad, but I felt it was a little short.Maybe the purchase price should have reflected this. I noticed many different versions of this book and with so little old script in hindsight I would go for a lower priced copy.	1
What a great way to get books!	1
Great read for those who follow the way of Bushido	1
Incredible	1
Enjoy this book	1
Soft cover like 40 pages not book	0
Written over two thousand years ago, in a time when wars were fought with chariots, this book offers succinct advice for military commanders. It reminds me of Machiavelli's "The Prince," which offers succinct advice for rulers. Both books are brief. Both books offer astute and sometimes provocative guidance. Both books derive additional interest from their historical importance. But I found "The Art of War" by far the easier read (part of a single afternoon), whereas, for me, "The Prince" was hard going. Two quotes to give a flavor of the book: "All warfare is based on deception." "Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting." I highly recommend this book, but not this specific edition, which appears to use the Lionel Giles translation without bothering to credit Mr. Giles (deceased he may be, but he deserves acknowledgment). Moreover, the edition lacks an introduction to provide historical context, and the ninth chapter has been moved forward without explanation.	1
Buy a different version. The person who wrote this ruined the book. I'm still trying to find a better version.	0
Great; Informative, Powerful, Thought-provoking Read! My son said he could not put the book down and continues to read it repeatedly.	1
This is a great book that covers strategies for more than just warfare. Very concise and top the point. Easy to read	1
If you want to learn more about war and different strategies then this book is for you. These tactics are still being used today for a reason. A must have for all that love learning about war and battles.	1
Great book. Everyone should read this at least once in their lifetime	1
Much to much background. A lot of "he said, she said" by the author that overwhelms Sunzi. Many people have mentioned his sayings yet one has to pick through the bale of hay to find those needles of wisdom so delicately placed.	1
Puts things in perspective.	1
Dr. Giles' translation is excellent for academics, sinophiles, and those attempting to Sun Tzu's principles to endeavors unrelated to military purposes. It is not as useful for the fields for which it was intended, however; those being the military and intelligence fields. Readers from those professions are better served by the translations by Griffith or Sawyer, who share more relevant insights than the less experienced Giles.	1
great book	1
For work or play the theory espoused is on the money	1
This book met all my expectations and lived up to the promotions voiced by a co-worker.  I would recommend it to a friend.	1
Not well described	1
Like the book just thought it would have more pages but an easy read	1
I'm not a solder, but I am an intercessor in prayer.  Some times it helps to understand how your enemy works and or thinks. The Devil is the enemy of all man kind.  I use this book in prayer to fight for my family, country and for the peace of Israel.	1
Inexpensive copy, great for quick reading and reference, but you can tell that no care or thought was put into this product, for example, chapter IX appears before chapter V...	0
A Classic	1
This book is loaded with lots of information. All of it is thought provoking. Worth the read if you have an extra couple hours.	1
Pretty interesting read, especially if you're into strategy like me.	1
Fast and Flawless shipping! Book is in great condition and I especially like the slightly larger fonts, makes for easy reading. Great Product!	1
The book "The Art of War" was in excellent condition and the purchase process was easy. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the book.	1
Great	1
One of the books I always like to come back to and read it again and again. SO many practical advises for so many real situations. Great.	1
Should be mandatory teaching early on in schools.	1
This book was not an easy read; I was a litle bored by the way it was written but then what should one expect of notes created many hundreds of years ago.  Many of Sunzi's concepts are still valid today.	1
If you ever want to learn of war strategy and chinese culture, this is the book to read. I really enjoyed it!	1
A good read	1
Not sure how to apply the information yet.	1
i will probably buy another text with interpretation of the original, as i would like an opinion of how it applies to real life and or business life, and strategies.	1
I enjoyed it.	1
This is the Art of War however you have interjections and what not throughout the text with kind of sucks but you have to remember that you're getting the book for free so you can just skip all the other crap, and it is crap. I read the first half of that crap so I can see why so many people are mad at it. Just skip it and read Sun's words, it isn't too hard to do when you have a kindle.	1
Its a art	1
Truly timeless and a legitimate must in anyones library, these writings can be applied to numerous parts of anyones life.	1
Outstanding read, all should partake in	1
Perfect and quick	1
It applies today as well.	1
must read	1
Its ok not as comprehensive as some versions, but its a good smaller version of the more detailed readings. it summarizes well.	1
one of the easiest interpertations I have read	1
I enjoyed it very much. The thinking strategy can be applied to almost anything in life, especially if competiton is involved.	1
Lot of ancient wisdom in this little book. I will definitely refer to it .	1
this is more commentary than the actual Art of War. Its remarkable how hard it is to find a simple copy of the Art of War, everyone wants to pollute it with their thoughts and clarifications - unnecessary. Do not recommend.	0
Very stragetic book good for the mind. Recommend this book to friends and family. like the book because it was straight to the point.	1
you can get this on the internet for free but its nice to have it on book form	1
I had no idea how much I would enjoy this book. Sun Tzu was a wise man, and I think there is a lot to learn from him. Even though I do not plan on starting any wars anytime soon(or ever). Read it.	1
Great classic. Sun Tzu was a military master, who understood the Art of War of his time and his territory.	1
good deal	1
It is a great read. Very useful for business and life. every one should read this book and keep it handy	1
Great	1
Great book!	1
Great book!	1
Great book and information for those of us that move strategically and think critically....	1
Will be a difficult read but is a gem	1
It wasn't the actual book just footnotes	0
Free book, Free book, Free book, Free book, Free book, Free book, Free book, Free book, Free book, seriously nothing wrong with a free book	1
This is a public domain translation. There is no preface, introduction or extra frills of any kind. For the dirt cheap price, this book is a steal!	1
Shipping was fast and convient. The book itself is a short book about 13 chapters 68 pages or so but it's a good book!	1
I thought this would be the full edition.  What I received was a condensed version with excerpts.  Not at all what I expected.	1
First time purchase of a book on disk and I will be doing it again. Easy listening and done in a manner that makes you what to continue to go on. The price is fair and the delivery was fast.	1
Have been wanting to read this for a long time, finally... Simple, almost poetic, very appropriate, considering the state of things.	1
great	1
As relevant today as 600BC	1
Thought this was the full book it wasn't.	0
The book was described in enough detail that I knew I was ordering the exact edition that I needed and the condition was exactly what I was looking for in a book. Delivery was very fast and the price was the best I was able to find. I hear repeatedly about how this book should be read if you are interested in the subjects of national security or simply to get an understanding of current world events.  These recommended reading lists should be updated as there are many far better books on the theory or aggression, mechanics and psychology of troop movements and battle, and theory of war.  The complexity of our current socioeconomic arena and how the world responds often defies explanation utilizing historic strategies and theories.	1
Fantastic! !!	1
Shortened version,  not apprentice from description.	0
Just covers the basics	1
Great classic. No complains since I got this for free. Always a good book to have in your library for reference.	1
Great book	1
Arrived in great condition	1
Pretty dry really. Likely a good read for new and/or youthful military enthusiasts.	1
The military still studies this book today.  To bad the politicians didnt have it during Viet Nam, it seemed that Gen Giap had it and used it succesfully.	1
I bought this for a gift.  They loved it!	1
Without trying to give a 'spoiler', this book is a 'self help' of sorts that helps you to view different situations in life (in general) from a different perspective and in so doing help you think of ways to overcome and/or cope with them. This version, is smaller than I expected and the quality of the print was pretty good, no blurred lines or strangely angled letters. Good read, highly recommend.	1
It is easy to see why this book has become required reading for so many senior military officers.  It has stood the test of time like none other.  I highly recommend it for military and civilians alike.	1
👍	1
Good read!!!	1
HARD TO UNDERSTAND ALOT OF IT	1
*THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL BOOK* I rated this five stars to help make others aware of a glaring issue with this product and to help project the voice of those who rated it one star and had this similar issue. This listing fails to show within the description that this is the abridged version of the book, unfortunately I wasn't aware of that and for a quick summary of what the actual book has to offer this does the job but shame on the seller for not clarifying what people are purchasing.	1
Essential read, classic.	1
Great book to get into reading again and very well formatted	1
This book will change how you look at a lot of the situations that regularly drive you crazy during the course of the day.	1
I love this book. It is very simple and easy to read. I can grasp the concept reasily. Thanks a bunch!	1
This book is straight forward and understandable. A surprising amount of the advice can be applied today - to non-military circumstances.	1
Great	1
Good book. Brilliant tactician.	1
Was a great price and was in perfect condition	1
Never received this!!!	0
I was excited to received book.  Started reading where chapter IV should begin is chapter IX.  So it chapter 1, 2, 3, 9.  Going to order another book again I guess.  Thanks.	0
This copy of mine arrived just a few minutes ago, and I havent gone as far as read the contents but the translation looks pretty easy to understand, the chapter divisions seems neat, and I cant wait to read it.  What makes me give this a two star is the condition of my book when it arrived.  It looks like it has been bent and it's not smooth at all. There are very visible cracks at the back cover and not only one or two cracks: there are a LOT of them. Im expecting some quality stuffs from Amazon and this is my first time purchasing something from you but looks like you didn't quite treat my package well huh. And to think I chose the second best shipping for my package. I guess I gotta rethink my next purchases from this website. I'm disappointed.	0
The quality of this product is pretty satisfying. It is very good price and the thing I liked the most was the speed of delivery. It arrived 3 times faster than expected, so it is good.	1
I read this book and realized that in todays world, this book could apply to dealing with people in the boardroom as well as the battle field. I re-read it constantly	1
Great book and awesome delivery.	1
Had a copy, lost it...this is nice	1
This book is timeless and will always have reread value. It came in great condition and without delay. I would recommend to anyone who likes to read books that can be applied to real life situations.	1
ok	1
So good and informative I ordered this for a friend going into politics!	1
And excellent guide to the basics of military organization and general life practices. A must read work if ever I've seen one.	1
The commentaries in between each paragraph can be annoying to read through before the actually paragraph is finished. It might be amazons ridiculous design that ruins the literature, because the original text is inspiring.	1
A must for any leader.	1
In this book, each passage by Sun Tzu is immediately followed by several different interpretations of that passage.  It is difficult to read because the book is so broken up by other translators.  Very annoying.	1
Great translation. Very smooth and easy to read. Recommend for anyone looking to transform an ancient acumen into a business advantage.	1
Classic book came quick in great condition. Excited to read. Shorter than expected.	1
It's all here and effectively translated, but features several juvenile typos that lend a jarring immaturity to this type of text.	0
Very good on many levels.	1
The recipient of this gift reported that it was an interesting book. It arrived on time and well packed. History lovers should enjoy this book.	1
Read the item description carefully. This book is only 68 pages long and only highlights important parts of the book, (not well).	0
The foundation of eastern strategic thought	1
This book is very useful if you are playing a strategic war game or planning on joining a military! Not to mention that this teaches you useful vocabulary and tactics. All in all great In my opinion!	1
The person rewriting this classic piece of work adds in too much of his own commentary. It makes for difficult reading in regards to when sunzi is instructing and when this rewriter is commenting. It was like reading 2books.	1
Great book, from beginning to end very good book. I would recommended to everyone to read it would not regret it.	1
dont buy this. its not what you think	0
Good and short. I think it will serve me most playing Rome Total War. In real life, mmmm, Well I guess having the mentality in ones back head can be of good use.	1
Fails in storytelling, lists his philosophies in concise points, giving no context whatsoever, but what more can you expect in 68 pages book on this topic.	0
good edition	1
This was a short book, read quickly.  My husband and I read it together and we both found it informative.  It's classic and the principles can be applied to various areas of your life, not just physical war.	1
Really enjoyed the concepts the author presented, they can be applied to many of life's challenges. It is a book to keep for reference.	1
'nuff said	1
Every American war fighter should be required to study this.Its ancient wisdom.	1
A very good read!	1
Easy read	1
Great book for people who want a strategy book. It has many complicated words and sometimes you have to think about what he means or is trying to say.	1
The editing of the book is lousy	0
Not a lot of pages	0
Not the book you think is 68 pages there could be different versions	0
Not the original book.....a SALE BOOK	1
Thought it was the full version, but good as a clarification or supplement to the full book.	1
Great book, good insight for leadership and influential people.	1
Not interesting at all, boring rather	0
Strategic!	1
Written 2,000 years ago this book is fanatastic and eery but full of insight with wise perspective. Highly reccomended to everyone!	1
Highly recommended.  Thanks to Sun Tsu I can deal with conflict from a knowledgable position.  I look back and see some of my shortcomings and failures and see I could have been successful had I this information.	1
N/c	1
Reading this text through the lens of Christian doctrine has shown that many archetypal beliefs exist among men of faith. Within this text, the man of war is presented as a well-disciplined and wise individual who abhors war. For him, war is the last option and not the first. This ancient book of wisdom contrast with the practices of many modern world leaders. The translator's introduction often references the  Tao te Ching which might also be excellent reading for the man of faith who hopes that the can communicate his beliefs with others who have a background in Eastern philosophy (1 Corinthians 9:19-23). If sustained peace ever enters this modern era, it will come from the body of faithful, peaceful, and well-disciplined men. Much like Gideon and other Biblical accounts, the text states that the greatest warrior can win a war without fighting a battle. Unfortunately, this text often is read by greedy, power-hungry individuals who do not seek peace and are misled by the title. The teachings which I contains can be used for "good" or "evil". With this text, one can heal "difficult" situations or promote anarchy as the modern physician can heal or kill with prescription medicine. This is a powerful text and excellent reading.	1
Great book	1
Classic work of literature; if not this edition, find another one that works.	1
If you don't have this book in your library, well get one now. It's really essential for dealing with modern life.	1
I purchased this book on the assumption that it would be just as good as any other printing of the same title. However, it seems that the formatting of the book is very poorly done. Bullet points and lists are simply listed out in a single paragraph, and there is no apparent effort to make the ideas visually clear. I would steer clear of this printing and invest in a better-presented edition of the book.	0
This is a great book for those young, fresh commanders who are looking for advice, I would recommend this book to any and all commanders	1
Love it. Taught me a lot about battle Strategies.	1
product came in very great condition	1
Or perhaps this is simply 'horse sense'? But refined by an acute mind. Also a fascinating glimpse of a bygone period	1
Truly enjoyed. Learnt so much.	1
this IS my bible.  ever since i first read it in 1993, I keep a copy on me at all times.	1
An inspirational book for strategists.	1
Rating got of 5 because of the total knowledge that is produced by the original text. How it relates to life in society as we know it	1
Great buy	1
Helped me to understand why the Trump Administration won the election	1
I expected "the art of war" book, this is not the book, this is the notes added to the book. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew.	0
great book. fast shipping!	1
The content is excellent, the size of the book was disappointing (standard paper book)	0
as described	1
Arrived in excellent condition	1
Very artistic and warlike.	1
Classic	1
It may not be the longest written book, but it definitely it the most powerful for its size.  True insight and understanding of how to tackle and conquer any obstacle.	1
orderd books for girlfriends little sister, recived them in a timely manner...  good job on getting them to her in time for school!!!	1
can easily be used in one's everyday life if one can understand that it is not limited only to war.	1
good advice for life's battles in the work place. It's interesting that his stratagem holds true in the 21st century.	1
The book os a classic, the strategies are excellent and reading was fast. I would recommend it for coaches and salespeople.	1
Excelent version of the classic Sun Tzu's Art of War, with very good comentaries from contemporany and pos-contemporany chineses generals.	1
Great book, Great Price!	1
Happy with the book and how fast got it.	1
It's a good book	1
Great read	1
Overall it was a good read but was a bit confusing with all the translations. The format could have been better but it's worth reading at least once in your life!	1
I now see why this has been the best war philosophical situations :)	1
Seems everybody gives this one as a free one, but few people read it.  It really IS worth the time, if even the only thing learned is that 'the art of deception' used  by Islamics is nothing new.	1
Great	1
Easy read. Informative and insightful information.	1
It's a marvelous book. Although I thought it be a lot smaller than it is. its clean with no creases in the cover or anywhere else. Good SUPER fast shipping.	1
i wanted to have this book to go with my other books. but this book was rather wide. but other than that is it exactly what i expected. not missrepresented in any way. i recommend all people ready this work.	1
Good to read.	1
Very happy with this book.	1
good book!	1
Excellent	1
Great food for thought!	1
Always a good read.	1
It was a really good book at a great price. My daughter ordered it. She liked it very very much.	1
helped me understand the book better	1
GOOD STUFFF	1
Didn't explain very well what it was, it wasn't what's I was looking for.	0
Rather skinny book.	1
son loves it!	1
Purchased for my son upon recommendation of our company CEO. He is an Actuary and loved it.	1
Still reading it its kinda deep still learning the art of war	1
Great book.	1
The books is very well known and it serves as a manifesto for those who want to master "The art of war"	1
This book teaches you not about war but you can use it in just about every situation. Great book. 😁	1
Basic and Brilliant. About 70 pages. Small and thin. Took me less than 20-25 minutes to fully read. Has different strategies, laying plans, maneuvering, attack...Contains everything one could need to know about the 'Art of War'. Though I ended up finding the whole thing online but if you want the book then here it is, cheap.	1
Short and simple, but lacks the examples found in certain other editions. Also the text seems to be missing certain vital points	1
I'd recommend this to any martial artist, strategist, or military enthusiast. The translation notes really help understand everything that the author tried to get across.	1
Very informative.	1
Awesome read... a must for anyone in leadership position.	1
Very clear way to analyse the situation with focus on your assets, possibilities for sucess and failure. It's useful to read.	1
Has great business and organizational leadership value.	1
The ending of this book clarifies to not always as a leader let your follows know the entire plan is finished until it takes place!  The killing of spies is not an easy part of this book to swallow?  Christ did say "He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword?	1
Another one of the greatest books of all time!	1
my daughter needed this book for an assignment and it was very easy to purchase.  Thank you very very much	1
The contents are fine but the book is a cheap reprint. It's also very small with few pages.	0
It's a good book to be familiar with the concepts but it's a pretty boring read.  Like has been said about this book the ideas can be used in every part of life in general.	1
A classic that's still relevant.	1
This book is NOT the Art of War, just a basic OUTLINE reviewing key concepts and principles. I do not recommended this product to anyone.	0
i received it on time and in very good condition.  it was a gift and he said he enjoyed it.	1
It is a classic, so how can you not find this book fascinating?  I am glad to have this one on my Kindle.	1
Book in excellent condition	1
This is what I expect from a seller... perfect in every way... buy from them with confidence. A++++ is what I say	1
This book was easy to read with the notations and references. It is also practical for everyday use in getting ahead in your career ; especially in corporate America. Just use your imagination!	1
Interesting, didn't realize it was dvd.	1
Very interesting read	1
I didn't realize the book was just a bunch of quotes; most of which you can find online for free. Some relevant information you can use when negotiating.	1
Its interesting	1
Great book	1
No where does it say abridged or condensed. This is not the real book.	0
IT IS One of the best books I Have ever read it gives many applications for aspects it is A must read	1
This book is a good read.	1
Many of the points mentioned are applicable even today	1
Had read it before. Good but as a pocket version it didn't have translation notes.	1
Good read	1
A must for anyone owning a business. You will have be outside the box and way out in to the limits of normal thought, but it makes sense.	1
Did not like the assorted commentary and a little obtuse translation.	0
classic advise, everyone should read.	1
I had thought that this book would have had a bit more detail, but it seems to be a highly abbreviated outline of the original Art of War.  Still, it was a pretty good read.	1
The only problem I had with it was it was too short. I had thought that it would have been much longer and not end quite so abruptly.	1
Obviously a classic, The Art of War is a solid meditation not only on the nature of war, but the nature of life.	1
This wasn't at all what I expected.	0
Not the book we expected there are so many versions, per the reviews I bought this one but it lacks in what we were looking for. Very thin compared to ones we have seen so I must have misread the description. Still lot's of wonderful info.	1
Riddled with typos and apparently not the real book.	0
This is NOT Art of War but rather the bad version of its cliff notes. Amazon should not promote this as Sun Tzu's book. No efforts was made towards basic editing or printing this book. It's cheap paper with really bad ink. The brown Amazon box it arrived in is far superior than this book.	0
What a great strategic. Its amazing	1
Not really a good book. Not one you would want to read again. Easy to read but not worth the time it takes to read it.	0
Apply to real business world, marketing practices and can be taken as the book on effective leadership. Old but effective theory.	1
excellent	1
Good principles, but not an easy read for western culture folks. Still worthile though, you may have a different impression than me.	0
not the actual book. I am quite unimpressed and was very much looking forward to reading the book in its entirety.	0
Nice	1
I have had this book numerous times and keep reading it until I need a replacement. The strategies in this book can be applied to most any situation in business and has been read by every American President except the current one. And it shows.	1
great book.	1
Translator seems to be writing his own book about the famous book.  Very hard to follow as it is became a very boring history book about a book.	0
Very interesting and helpful book. But you need to read between the lines ;-)	1
Basic text for understanding a classic	1
Many typos and formatting problems.  The only good thing to say about this translation is that it can put you to sleep -- instantly.	0
A clear and understandable textbook of military science.	1
Have not started to read it yet. I'm trying to finish 48 laws of power first. I can't wait to start it tho.	1
Great book. This book was wrote both in book format and to be used as a reference. Any fan of the history of war will enjoy this book on war strategy.	1
The book itself is a masterpeice. What I rate with one star is the fact that with this issue there is no foreword. It just says "Filiquarian Publishing LLC" from what you cannot find out who translated the book? Is it Sam Griffith's translation? Or whose? It doesn't even say basic stuff about Sun Tzu. Nothing. If you ask me, find a free pdf on the net and print it yourself (just 60 pages) because sadly, there is no value for money in this print.	0
Sun Tzu is taught world wide for a reason!  The man may not have came up with these all by himself but he understood them.  A winner!  Sun Tzu not Hollywood is the great teacher about human conflict.	1
Good read.	1
A very awesome book!  Completely satisfying!  I'm glad I had the pleasure of purchasing it.  I thank you very much!	1
great insights when seen from the era this was written. true warfare wisdom for those times, many of which are still applicable.	1
Straight from Sun Tzu without anyone telling you what he said. The book is short and it is up to use the knowlege.	1
i havent read this yet but the cover looks really cool. i have it on my desk so robbers think im really smart and will kill them if they steal from me	1
Super super SUPER condensed. Do not buy this book if you like to read. This is a short summary of each chapter. I'm pissed I bought this. It has a total of 41 pages.	0
Simple and basic Sun Tzu, with no fluff.	1
This is not a work of fiction or a novel. It's more a technical manual on the various components of war.	1
In every single paragraph, there is distilled wisdom and many stories (and dead bodies) behind it. No word is used meaninglessly.	1
Missing Chapter 9	0
It helps with other aspects of your life	1
This book is useful and I recommend it to all manager to read.	1
The alternative translations and historical background makes this my favorite interpretation	1
I bought the book for a friend. Therefore I am unable to review the content.	1
The philosophies of Sun Tzu are easily transferable to present time in the corporate world and in everyday business.  I am grateful that my professor suggested that I read this book.	1
Great Read	1
Un grand livre	1
Of course this is a 5 star read. It is a classic. It is the quintessential book on how to win a war. It has survived for centuriesd and has been studied many many times . It's an easy read and very intriguing. Highly recommended.	1
Didn't know it was going to be that thin :/. Nevertheless, a fantastic book that came in great condition that all soldiers should have a copy of.	1
Good book. Quality of book was good for the price. Was delivered promptly	1
Useful in so many aspects of life. One can convert the principles in this book to be objective in any social condition.	1
I have heard about this book for years and I am glad to now have a copy.  It is a simple translation but a clear one making understanding this thinking...	1
It got delivered as promised and in great condition	1
Book is very small and short-not what I expected.	0
The best daily version of 'The Art of War' that I have.	1
Giving it a 3 start because I haven't finished reading it but so far so good. Too many things to read and I have a LOT of these types of books/Ebooks that I received for free and all at once.	1
Centuries in wisdom in one single book	1
Great book superfast shipping	1
what more can be said download it read it, if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things)	1
This is more of a review of the book than the actual book. Very hard to read on a kindle due to all the names and annotations.	0
Good read. ☺ Can be studied several times.	1
This is the basic text of the ancient text, the art of war with very few illustrations.  I was expecting several illustrations.	1
Great quick read	1
Very short and choppy. The book itself is structured more like the bible than an actual book.still kind of interesting	0
This is an thoughtful and enlightening book which the strategies can be transferred to be used on our everyday lives.	1
Overall quality is OK (great for the price... which is free!). Reads good, nothing fancy. I do find it funny when I put the text to speech on listening to the voice try and pronounce all these chinese names (Sun Tzu = Sun Ta Zoo), I guess an audiophile may not like that, but as for me I buy books to READ them. I probably would not pay for this version, but for free it cannot be beat and I'll stick with this version.	1
Not a book . This is highlights from a translation . Maybe twenty pages .	0
Every marketing dweeb is in love with this book!!!  We should not be at war for no reason but its a way to justify how to screw over the common man.	1
The book is so good	1
Awesome strategies to use in everyday life. Wish I could have read this a long time ago. Can't wait to finish	1
What can you say - excellent book at an excellent price.  I purchased five copies this time around for people I knew so they could read through the wisdom of this ancient leader and apply it to their every day life.	1
Uploading it to Kindle must've messed up the formatting, I guess? The whole book is a jumbled mess of hanging paragraphs   and stray indents that ruin the flow of the words. 1 star from this casual English student.	0
It was great.	1
Great book	1
Typical paperback quality. The content of the book is great. Quick read with practical daily application. It's required reading at my school.	1
its ok	1
It is incredible such a famous book and its only commonplaces. I don't know many bussinesmen and politics what do they see in it.	0
Great book a must read trust me there is a reason 2000 year's after it was wrote it is still relevant.not as long as u would think.	1
Thanks so much!	1
good read	1
It is what it is	1
I guess i was expecting more but for the time frame the man was brilliant.  I guess I was looking for more of an explanation of war in a more modern view.  My rating reflects a more personal view, this may be just what someone else is looking for. For me it's like looking back at the bow and arrow, we've come a long way since then.	1
Bought it for a friend as a b-day gift.  I was proud to give it as a gift.  High quality.	1
This book is a life changer	1
This is such a great edition. The commentary is fabulous.  I have listened countless times and it never gets old	1
Very simple design and a good translation.	1
Just what I wanted.	1
As with any ancient text, translation matters greatly. Fortunately, this version isn't fraught with errors and mistranslations, at times, common in free ebooks. The content needs no praise or introduction as it remains an influential and widely applicable text. A recommended read.	1
Great item.	1
True teachings to be studied and meditated on	1
Great book. Perfect condition	1
Excellent version of The Art of War. Not much extra derails or commentary, but very good translation of the works.	1
i found this book to be very informational and i have truely gained much knowledge of what leadership, loyalty and sacrifice is about...	1
This book has so many strategies for life, work and home.  I'm applying them all to every aspect of my life.	1

I am only giving this 4 stars because I found it a little dull. I am sure that way back when it was written it was more interesting, but for me, this was a hard book to finish	1

A book that can be used in most situations of life.	1
Awesome , on time delivery great book.	1

ordered this for my kindle its great, i love it and my kindle, not much more to say but that.	1
The reviews are clearly not all for the same book version. No explanations, no forward, just very brief and 'cryptic' translation that was meaningless to me. Glad it was relatively cheap.	0

great!	1
I have wanted to read this for a long time now only b/c I've heard so much about how you can apply it's theories to every day life.  Well, I suppose you can. Sorta.  But after a while it gets exhausting hearing about how you need to wake up earlier than your enemy; know more than you're enemy; be more rested than your enemy; blah blah blah.  Long story short, study hard.  Work hard.  I'm glad I have quenched my curiosity, but I'm glad I got it on the kindle and that it's NOT taking up room on my bookshelf.  It ain't that special.	1
Boring! it reads like a book for geeks, it reminds one of the old instrucktional books for the vcr. The opening of the book is a sleeper. I heard so many good things about it and then was greatly disapointed. This is for file thirteen a real snoozer. If you have trouble getting to sleep read this.	0
Not what I expected.  I guess it was written more like poetry, not my cup of tea even though it offered advice on how to strategical fight a war.	1
great book	1
Fantastic insights on war.	1
I've always wanted to read this book, and when I saw it for free I just had to go for it. It's not the smoothest read, but the principles throughout this book can be used in battle, sports or business. Download it and see if you can't apply some of what's in here to your own life.	1
Dear Customer Service: Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy  the teachings of one of the Chinese Great Thinkers and enjoy their rich history.	1

The book is good. However, I expected a bigger book what I received is like an abridged version	1
One of the best books to read.	1
It is a book that you have to read over and over again to understand its content and relate the strategies to real world action. Too much information packed in a tiny book, bad combination!	1
One thing I learned from this book, always read the reviews first. This is an analysis, not the Art of War.	1
Love this book...Tq	1
Good translation	1
Brilliant!	1
This review is for the Filiquarian Publishing paperback version of the book. See the picture for the table of contents. I first thought the Roman numerals were mis-printed and corrected the numbers with a pencil, but I later looked the book up online (attached a screenshot) and the chapters are printed out of order! Somehow the chapter roman numerals are sorted alphabetically.	0
War will come this 2017. Black people must prepare, we need to defend ourselves against our enemies who plan to destroy us.	1

What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said except that it lived up to my expectation.	1
good classic book. Bit thin. I think the chinese version is better. Translation is a bit ackward in English	1
A must!	1
Not what I expected. It literally talks about war. I heard it was a philosophical book. Fast shipping. Good condition.	1
A must read for any leader or one who wants tone in a leadership role in the future...	1
It needs 0 stars, it is not the art of war book	0
Bought this for my brother and he said it was very interesting.	1
Superb, thrilling, amazing wisdom and utility. Trump must have read this and is using it. We had best learn it too.	1
Great book period!  Learn how past leaders as well as current use Sun Tzu tatics to fight Wars.	1
Nicely done	1
A little dry read.  Good principles for thought today..	1
This is not the full book that everyone thinks they are buying.	0
Good book	1
I was excited to read the art of war. When i started reading it i was very dissappionted. I think it is a very confusing read. Tthe translator is all over the place and then includes his own thoughts. Me and everyone else needs to find a better.copy.	0
Okay so I got this for a school project because it was the cheapest on the website under the impression it was a full 70-120 page book. If you are looking for the full length book DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. This book is no more than 30 pages long. If you are just using it for a reference book or something then its okay I guess.	1
Great read didn't get first 3x I read but when actually get into to it it makes sense and is awesome must read. Either this paper pack or that hard copy which like a bible has all kinda books written inside and hard copy well over 1000 pages easily huge wanna good read get that one like $60-$80 worth then read paper back explains the art and paper breaks it down like dummies for the art of war I'm disabled long and short term memory y had read. So much. But I retained it finally well most part. But if not into all that reading which I've had over a ur and not even half way done get paper back it maybe 100or so pages. Easy read. Took me an 1-1/2 to read and I don't really read so easy to read over and over so I can remember it. Something everyone needs to read regardless of life job or religion.	1
If you think reality is just a series of bizarre coincidences, don't bother with this.	1
Not what i thought it would be. I suspect it has modern applications, if you are a protester, or as a political tool. Perhaps this is why it has become so popular.	0
the ways of this have been around for a long time now we have the art of texing and tis a great book for centering the soul in battle i have used it many times in life	1
Never received this and now it's de-listed	0
Excellent! Timeless advice from a tactical master, is easily translated into the realm of corporate strategy. A must have for everyone who wants to climb the corporate ladder!	1

I was expecting the actual book. This is basically the chapters written down	0
A real Man sheds blood before he sheds tears.	1
The Translator's Preface started on page vii and ended at page lxv.  Which took about 1/4th of the book.  I wondered if the book proper itself would ever start.  Now that I finished the book I don't remember any the Preface.  Then the book part finally started which consisted of hundreds of little pieces of advice by Master Sun.  Sentence to paragraph length.  Each piece of advice was followed by a short explanation or repetition by another Master of what Master Sun had just stated.  When did this format end?  When the book ended.  As Sun was allegedly the Master, I eventually started just reading Sun's comments which allowed me to get to the end much quicker.  At least now I can truthfully say that I did, in fact, finish reading the book.  I marked one sentence in the book to be added to my review but now I can't find it.	0

Great book	1
This is a real classic that all business people should read once in a while. I am happy to have chosen it and it was shipped extremely quickly to me so I go back to reading it sometimes when I need a thoughtful advice...	1
I must first admit, I had bought into the hype over how The Art of War is the greatest strategic document ever produced.  I was expecting some fantastic insight and in reality, the Art is, like most brilliant strategies, very simple and basic steps to follow.  The trick is to not overlook the basics and keeping the discipline to always follow them. The book itself was set up into a very long and rambling prologue, then quotes from Sun Tzu followed by quotes from other Chinese leaders and/or philosophers.  There is no discussion about the meaning or intent of Sun Tzu beyond the quotes from the supporting cast.  In short, the book is written with quotes supported by other quotes without any context.  If you read books to get the full story and context behind a subject, go elsewhere.  If you are content with sound bytes and 10 second clips, this book is for you.	0

I will keep the 'substitute' books because they are useful and different.  Instead of sending me the books I ordered, they sent me other books that interpret the Art of War, version done by Tom Cleary.  I like these but this is NOT what I ordered.  I will not use this vendor again and will make a note of this.  I think these people did this to me before.	1
Buy a classic and an easy read to cross off your To Be Read list. I suppose someone with a particular interest in either war (duh) or self help would enjoy it substantially more.	1

Pure genius, Sun Tzu philosophy on war is nothing short of incredible. Phenomenally written and simplistic at the same time.	1
It was a photocopy with tiny letter type. I was so disappointed as I was planning to give this to my boss. This edition is aweful. Spend a couple of bucks more and get a decent edition. I can't describe how bad this is.	0
The book was written a long time ago so it is difficult to enjoy it from my point of view because it spoke of basic routines in fighting aspects of war. They are basic compared to how we wage war these days and they look primitive in nature.	1
I have just downloaded the kindle edition. The pagination is awful rendering the text to be almost unreadable. amazon need to up their game and not charge for this abysmal level of quality of reproduction.	0

The concepts are good however it's written in parables which makes for not very good reading	0
When I search for "Art of War" using Amazon's search engine, the first book on the results list should NOT be an extremely short, cliff's notes version of the book.  When I purchased this, I was under the impression it would be the full length book.  This is a case of false representation, and I do not recommend this book to anyone.  I would rate this book (and my overall experience) with 0 stars if that was an option.	0

this is not the art of war, just notes. Do not be fooled. This book was free and even at free it was still a waste. Do not bother. If your looking for the art of war check out The Art of War by Thomas Cleary, very good translation. If you looking for the best translation it is The Art Of Strategy by R.l. wing.	0

Seems there are at least a couple, and maybe several different translations that are being sold using this review thread. I'm sure some must be good, since the reviews are overwhelmingly good, but the one I got is terrible. The version with the black cover, white text, and two horizontal red bars above and below Sun Tzu's name is the one to which I am referring. I have only read a few pages, but they are riddled with typos. Pg. 6 (actually page 3) "While heading the profit of my council..." The word is "heeding." Almost certainly an English as a second language translator who didn't run this by a decent editor. Yeah, yeah, I know, they know English better than I know Chinese, but I'm not trying to sell my knowledge of Chinese.	0

This was a free dowload and I probably will never read it, thanks for the bathroom material amazon, it was great.	0
This did not mention that it was an abridged version, very surprising.	0
Never ordered it, never received it.	0
The translation is clumsy and needs improvement.  Copy editing is sloppy.  Numerous typos, misspellings, punctuation, and format errors.  Serves as a cheap option, but would not recommend it for anyone seeking a quality copy to add to their collection or library.	0
Needless to say, Sunzi's this book is a must have on your shelf whoever you are whatever job you are doing, you are going to use the ancient art of war to deal with daily trivia or business critical things.	1
Bullshit bingo book. You'll find famous quotes all around it, in every chapter. It is best to win without fighting. Management of many is the same as management of few. It is a matter of organization. A leader leads by example not by force. Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley. Speed is the essence of war. And many many others. Sound familiar? Right. They are used by everybody taken out of the context. Especially by life / career / business coaches of all kinds. Mid-level managers, C-level executive wannabes. By that kind of people, not by military professionals. I can hardly believe that somebody who has professional military education will learn anything from this book. It's nothing more but a common sense. Like: "do not fight when you can". C'mon! We all know that already! "Hide your weaknesses and strength from the enemy". Of course I'll do! "Attack at the weakest point". Sure, nobody wants to die in a suicide mission fighting outnumbering entrenched enemy. And so on. I can hardly believe that modern military commanders use Sun Tzu's terrain, battlegrounds and positions categorization. As well as any other typification from this book. You can now bomb an enemy or send a drone. Or a nuke. Or a SEAL squad. Infantry and cavalry lost some of it's importance during the last 2500 years passed. The war (despite "war never changes") has changed a lot since then. Think about this: the book was actually written by Sun Tzu for his master, king of the state of Wu, when Sun Tzu served Wu during the confrontation with the state of Chu. So, the context of this book is: China, Zhou dynasty era, state of Wu. And the role of this book is clear too: to summarize the knowledge available at that time. So, the book cannot be used by it's direct purpose nowadays — to teach military personnel, and it became popular in another roles: to be a source of quotes for people who want to show others that they read smart books; and to be used for "inspiration", mostly by white-collars. By people who will never use 99% of this book on practice. Because, you know, you cannot "camp in high places, facing the sun", "gather in plunder" and "put men to death together with whom the secret was told" and do other fun stuff from this book when you're just a clerk. Even a CEO cannot literally put a man to death today. And, yes, Sun Tzu is not always humane in this book. One can say that "The Art of War" is a philosophical book, not a tactics / strategy guide. Probably. That's why I'm giving it two stars. There was some kind of mysterious zen in it, but I didn't become enlightened a lot. The book, again, is nothing special but a common sense of 2500-year-old war practice.	0
I began by reading an annotated version of the Art of War and switched midway to the original text because although the notes you can find in the free version on Amazon, it was a bit disruptive and I wanted to read the original text before digging deeper. That said, this is a fascinating book to read simply because it makes so much sense for so many things. For people in business, the metaphors are easily adaptable to a business model and no doubt this book has been read by many a high ranking official if only to gain understanding of what it takes to win. The same could go for coaches and even lawyers. Basically any scenario where there are two sides and both are seeking to be the victor can benefit from this. But there are some interesting ways where you can adapt what is said in this book. To mediate conflicts you can use many of the same steps and recommendations postulated within. The main thing that is sought from the Art of War is to win with as little bloodshed as possible. For many, the word war is synonymous with bloodshed, conflict, and loss of life. For Sun Tzu, avoiding all that is what makes the best general. If you can position things to the point where engaging in battle is folly and thus surrender is a better option, then you can see where he's coming from. In addition, there's another application I can recommend... having this text be read by writers. Conflict is embedded in what we write and for us who write fantasy and science fiction, battles on paper are common place. If you want to make a battle believable, study the things talked about in this book in detail and humanize the decisions taken, the actions carried out, and the mistakes that are part of a believable scenario. A rich read that will no doubt yield knowledge in its original and annotated versions.	1
A very brief summary of most of the key phrases or quotes from the original classic. Add graphic artwork = entertaining introduction to the classic.  I recommend it.  Buy the hard copy, not Kindle. It is not the original full edition of the classic. This Smartercomic is not intended to be the full text. I read the Art of War or Strategy in college and several times thereafter. I refer to it periodically. The critics miss the point of this edition:  an introduction and entertainment. After reading this edition, you will want to read the original. It is enjoyable to read, easy to understand, and the artwork gives the reader a different perspective and promotes the application in today’s world.	1
A. Overview The ancient Chinese military general Sun Tzu lays out a blueprint for the effective waging of war. In his classic The Art of War, the successful war campaign largely revolves around two key elements: deception and surprise. Sun Tzu also describes the virtues that are required of effective military leaders, and, drawing from his many years of military experience, he gives wide ranging and insightful advice on knowing oneself, knowing one's enemy, and how to keep the spirits of one's soldiers fixed on victory. Throughout his treatise, his words are piercing, direct, at times witty, and often paradoxical. He writes, for example, "If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant" (I.22). "Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength" (V.17). 1. Virtues Necessary for a Successful War Campaign The Commander is to be an exemplar of five virtues: wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness (I.9). Discipline among the Commanders and soldiers is the key to victory. One can even determine which side in a war will be victorious by asking "(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?" (I.13). 2. The Law of Deception The Law of Deception is summarized by Sun Tzu with these words: "All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near" (I.18-19). Sun Tzu goes to great lengths in justifying this assertion and in giving examples of how to deceive and to detect deception from the enemy. He writes, "Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat" (IX.24), but "Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot" (IX.26). "At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you" (XI.68). 3. Law of Surprise Attack Surprise is also an important element in weakening the enemy. The military is to "[a]ppear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected" (VI.5), and, "[i]n raiding and plundering, be like fire, in immovability like a mountain" (VII.18). "Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt" (VII.19). 4. Effective Warfare The rest of the treatise focuses on how to wage war in an effective manner. War is to be waged by first knowing oneself and knowing one's enemy. Battle is never undertaken unless one is certain that he will win. Sun Tzu outlines the five principles of victory: "(1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign" (III.17). A successful war campaign is waged efficiently, with the Armed Forces knowing when and how to attack by expending as little effort as possible, for "supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting" (III.2). Few resources are to be expended in an effective war campaign: "The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice" (II.8). Sun Tzu also seems to hint at a metaphysical plane in which warfare is fought. He writes, for example, that the effective Commander "wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated" (IV.13), as though war is first fought on some metaphysical plane before the victory and defeated is reflected in the visible, physical world. B. Critique Some of Sun Tzu's counsel is outdated in the age of terrorism, military insurgencies, and digital and nuclear warfare. Some of it revolves around the size and numbers of the enemy's forces and one's advantage relative to the enemy based on numbers. Similarly, much of his advice is based on obsolete forms of land warfare that are rarely fought in the modern day. He writes, for example, "Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted" (VI.1). This advice will rarely, if ever, be relevant in an age where most warfare is fought in the air or from long range missiles, with forces rarely clashing in land battles. The advent of nuclear weapons also changes the entire equation of relative forces and makes the numbers of infantrymen almost irrelevant. Similarly, the introduction of insurgencies that blend into local populations have been able to render even large armies of well equipped soldiers ineffective and unsuccessful. Furthermore, the advent of digital and cyber-warfare makes the numbers of enlisted and commissioned soldiers largely irrelevant to foreign attacks. Though the forms of warfare have changed over the ages, many of Sun Tzu's principles continue to apply. Whether fighting a land battle or an air battle, the laws of deception and surprise attack are still relevant and highly effective. Furthermore, Sun Tzu outlines lessons that are important not only for the battlefield, but also for the general struggles of life. He writes, "You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked" (VI.7). This is advice that should be heeded by businessmen, political leaders, and anyone else in a position that requires defending against an onslaught of attacks or competition.	1
Ignore the reviews that claim this isn't the full book. It is. The Art of War, without introductions and other people's commentary, is actually no bigger than a pamphlet. If you are looking for a "larger" version, there are a vast amounts to choose from and can range significantly in page count depending on how much additional comments and stories they want to include. If you just want what was written without all the filler, this is it.	1
I began this book wondering how a centuries-old text could be applicable to twentieth century business negotiations.  I finished it wondering why modern business books are so irrelevant.  Rather than summarize, here are some of the jewels:   A leader leads by example, not by force.   The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.   Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.   Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.   There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.   The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.   When you move, fall like a thunderbolt.   Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley.   Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.   When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Sun Tzu combines a startling humility with a stunning sense of responsibility.  He could not care less who gets the glories of victory.  He would prefer to be called a coward and win, then a hero and lose.  Sun Tzu's chief aim is not to fight, yet he bears the weight of his people's welfare on his shoulders.  To protect his people, he discipline himself and his troops mind, body and spirit until they cannot lose. In a world that prides itself on external victories, Sun Tzu's view of conquering the internal foe stands in stark opposition.	1
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is the timeless classic on the manners of warfare. The book itself is quite short but the wisdom contained in it means that it is quite a dense book to read anyway. While we may now read The Art of War and think that we know most of the things, I imagine it was simply a monumental book back then. Even now some of the passages contain immense value and many principles still apply. The principles outlined in this book are not only applicable to ancient Chinese warfare but many can interpreted in the world today. While many of the principles regards itself on positioning and strategic decisions some other principles struck me as well. Principles such as: "To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself." and "Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays" are applicable to everyday life as well. This arguably makes it one of the rare books which transcend the domain in which it was once written in and shows us something that is fundamentally human and gives us the opportunity to improve ourselves.	1
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is an ancient Chi­nese mil­i­tary trea­tise. The book, a clas­sic within the sci­ence of mil­i­tary stud­ies is only attrib­uted to the high rank­ing gen­eral and was believed to have been com­plies dur­ing the last spring and autumn of the War­ring States period(either 476 BC or 453 BC). I first heard of The Art of War by Sun Tzu when I was in the mil­i­tary. I heard of the book in pass­ing and read a bit more about it when I got home, but never picked up a copy until sev­eral years later. The first thing which struck me was how short the book was, but the more I read, the more I real­ized the wis­dom behind the book. The sec­ond, third, forth and more I read this book I stopped for con­tem­pla­tion about what Sun Tzu's words mean to me, how I imple­mented his advice both in the mil­i­tary and out­side of it and the mis­takes I made, how can I learn from them and if I will repreat them again. But The Art of War is more than just about war. The book is about every strug­gle or con­fronta­tion, whether exter­nal or inter­nal. I can cer­tainly see how the advice applies to ancient war­fare, but when ana­lyzed, the book can apply to pol­i­tics, busi­ness and more. Sun Tzu under­stood, as any great leader/manager that the lead­ers set the tone and spends much of the book dis­cussing those qual­i­ties. This is true in any orga­ni­za­tion, the sergeants will treat the sol­diers the way the pla­toon leader treats them, who treat the sergeants the way the cap­tains treat them, etc. Mid­dle man­age­ment will treat their employ­ees the way upper man­age­ment treats them - so sim­ple, yet so profound. How­ever, the part that really struck home, for me, was when Sun Tzu speaks about know­ing your­self and your enemy.   "So it is said that if you know oth­ers and know your­self, you will not be imper­iled in a hun­dred bat­tles; if you do not know oth­ers but know your­self, you win one and lose one; if you do not know oth­ers and do not know your­self, you will be imper­iled in every sin­gle battle." Pro­found advice from a great gen­eral - one does not go into any com­pe­ti­tion with­out know­ing the oppo­nents. Ath­letes do not step onto the field with­out spend­ing house ana­lyz­ing every avail­able movie show­ing their oppo­nents at play and gen­er­als dis­sect enemy strate­gies to tiny details before form­ing their own.	1
I really enjoyed this narration. It was easy and pleasant to listen to and the voices didn't detract from the information I was trying to soak in. This would be a good book to have a hard copy of or to reread several times to master all the principles and ideas presented within it. The Art of War was written by Sun Tzu, a Chinese general and war strategist 500 years b.c. It is a manual regarding war strategy and its main principles can be adapted for leadership, management and even parenthood in day to day interaction with others. I think it is a fairly useful concise book everyone should be introduced to. Here are the main points I liked from this book: 1. "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting." 2. "One may know how to conquer without being able to do it. " which leads into: Sun Tzu's emphasis on discipline, order, preparation and training. And the ability to know when to act and when to wait. 3. My favorite quote: "Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?" 4. "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle" 5. "The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent." 6. "We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors." 7. To obtain complete obedience and discipline you must administer ruthless punishment for disobedience on a regular basis. Small sacrifices are necessary for achieving the greater good. Yes, I cheated and copy and pasted these quotes off of google "art of war quotes" after listening to this audio version.  And if you don't have much time to spare even for listening than consider going through those quotes for a summary of the useful portions of the book.	1
A lot of people read The Art of War to gain insight into business competition, inter-personal conflict, etc. Personally, I think it is most interesting as an actual treatise on warfare, statecraft, and tactics as originally intended. Comparing the tactics and outcome of various battles and wars (past and present) to Sun Tzu's advice demonstrates that he generally knew what he was talking about and many (most?) of his principles still hold true. This translation made a serious effort to preserve the ambiguities present in the original, giving it a much more Eastern flavor than some older translations. I can't vouch for translation accuracy since I can't read the original, but Cleary at least sounds a bit more authentic than Giles (the "classic" English translation). The commentary sections sometimes gave insight into how "Master Sun" was understood by others over the next few centuries, but sometimes it was just a tedious unimaginative rephrasing of the original. On your first reading of The Art of War skip the commentary; it breaks up the flow of thought. (Also, don't bother with the 60 page intro unless you really want to hear the translator pontificate about Taoism for 50 pages while saying nothing that you can't pick up from the book itself) If you are interested in diplomacy, espionage, military tactics, etc. this is definitely a great read. Next time you watch a war movie or play a conquer-the-world type game you'll find yourself thinking in terms of The Art of War.	1
So it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will fight without danger in battles. If you only know yourself, but not your opponent, you may win or may lose. If you know neither yourself nor your enemy, you will always endanger yourself. The Art of War is the most prestigious and influential book on strategy that has ever been written. Sun Tzu showed how organizations can thrive in times of conflict and chaos by mastering five things: the way, the weather, the terrain, the leadership, and the discipline. Strategy is simply the art of making the right trade-offs. Everything we do in life has a cost-benefit. We must examine our choices and make the best one at each moment. Success is being the right person using the right tools in the right ways for the right cases at the right times for the right reasons. When I was 12, I wanted to enter West Point to become a general to lead and fight the greatest wars of my time. Yet, I began to realize that the biggest battles of this era were not between nations and man, but between health and disease. The world was crumbling with pollution, disease, hunger, fear, greed, violence, ignorance, and apathy. And these enemies would not be won by wars between men, but by revolutions within minds. These revolutions will not occur with the government, the education, or any social institutions. It will happen with businesses. This is the book that first connected me to my father. He told me that, "business is like modern day warfare." That always stuck with me.	1
This ancient classic of 13 chapters was written over 2,500 years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu. It is a must have for military buffs that enjoy reading about the tactics of the most succesful generals. It is rumored that Napoleon used a French translation of the Art of War to his advantage while conquering most of Europe, and he lost when he broke its principles. The principles that are with in this ancient text can also be used in games of strategy, business conflicts, and the day to day battles of life. Here are ten principles to give you a sample of the wisdom found in its pages: Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance with out fighting. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. Spies are the most important element in war, because upon them depends an army's ability to move. All warfare is based on deception. The general who wins a battle makes many calculations before the battle is fought. There is no instance of a country having benefited from a prolonged war. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. In war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. (So they can retreat). Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained, fight not unless the position is critical. Taken as a whole this is a book of wisdom and principles on how to win. I rank it in my top ten books I have ever read. It is a must have for any home library. The is a very small book that is quick and easy to read.	1
Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" is a great book. This ancient classic was written over 2,500 years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu, being a a timeless masterpiece of interaction of power and politics this book teaches many good lessons to anyone who will ever have to command a group of people, in the workplace, in school, or on the battlefield. The Art of War is an ageless book that teaches human nature and how to deal with difficult situations in life and business. The lessons learned in this book can be allied to relationship, friendship, career and make you a more complete person in general. I I recommend this book to be read by all those who wants to succeed in anything they do, It is not just about lessons in war but can be used and applied for everyday life. "The Art of War" is a must read.	1
I'm a civilian, businessman, and fan of strategy games and movies.  I've wanted to read this work for years but never got around to it.  When a friend gave me this, the audiobook version, I finally did "read" it. Thoughts about the content: The work is surprisingly short, powerful, and rational.  The descriptions are poetic but to the point.  Some passages are brilliant and self-evidently true, some are harder to follow, but the entire work is engaging and worth reading/listening to.  One can see why it is required material for military strategists and why so many people have called it the most important reference work on the subject of war of all time.  One of the most striking aspects to me personally were the apparent logical contradictions.  Act honorably because the moral high ground is critically important to military success, yet deception is the essence of warfare and you must deceive your opponent.  You must follow these rules strictly otherwise you will fail, yet you must remain open to opportunity and adjust your tactics accordingly throwing out the rules.  This is not to say the lessons are false or difficult, but that there are thought-provoking dilemmas to be explored.  I was especially fond of the discussion of the roles of morality, economics, and spies in warfare, as well as several of the anecdotal side stories of ancient battles and strategems. Thoughts about the presentation/execution: Apparently, the most common and best English translation available translates not just Sun Tzu's original words, but also the work of an almost-as-ancient commentator who interspersed clarifications and illustrative anecdotes throughout the main text.  Note that this complicates an audiobook, a fundamentally linear form.  Textually, you can see that there is a tangent without breaking your flow (depending on how the text is formatted), deciding if and when to read the tangent.  In this particular case, some of the commentary is truly required in place (it just wouldn't be understandable to a 21st century American listener without it) and some would best be read outside the flow of the main work (such as the stories of ancient battles that illustrate one of the "bullet points" being made).  I believe the producers made the best possible translation from text to audiobook, and the readers chosen are top notch, but moreso than other audiobooks this work would just fundamentally work better as text, and for this reason I drop it to 4 stars.	1
This is a decent version of a classic text. It's well laid out with a table of contents making it easy to dip in and out. The ideas and strategies are individually explained in a couple of sentences, prompting the reader to muse over the ideas and gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. Originally written over a thousand years ago, the timeless wisdom contained in this gem by Sun Tzu, has been utilised by many military and business men/women for profitable advantage. This Kindle version of, "The Art of War," contains reliable insights and strategies that you can put to practical use in your daily life, in an easily digested, readable format.

There are many translations of this work which has long been in the public domain. This is the popular translation by Lionel Giles made even more popular by the introduction from the best-selling author of Japan epics, James Clavell. It contains Giles' commentary along with the translation. The annotations give historical examples of the strategies in action. Game theory is calculated strategy. The Art of War by Sun Tzu is probably the oldest and most important book on game theory ever written. It is the culmination of the development of the best warfare tactics prior to the 5th century BC. It is considered the foundation for all military plans and is still used to this day. It is most popular for its ability to win wars without fighting one. Its application has shaped the world as we know it. The Art of War can be understood as a breakdown of the chaos of warfare into components that can be analyzed and understood. The tactics are mostly about controlled organization, recognizing environments and situations and the correct response to each one. Organization is subject to change in competition. The Art of War is essentially the strategy of responding to changing environments. Response is thus relative to evolving conditions. 1 - "Laying Plans" The core message of this chapter is to calculate as much as possible before committing yourself. Important themes include discipline, ethics, environmental conditions and assessing the competition. It's about setting up the mission and evaluating the competition. 2 - "Waging War" The important detail of this chapter is to win as quickly and as economically as possible. Prolonged struggle means wasting resources and undermining confidence. When winning, use the spoils as rewards and capital. It's about making war pay. 3 - "Attack by Stratagem" This chapter is about deployment of the previous two chapters. The central message is to know thyself and know thy enemy. This stage indicates problems such as sieges, bad management and interior anarchy or legal/government interference. Advantages such as good management, exploiting opportunities and attacking tactics are covered. Strength is about cohesiveness and is independent of size. 4 - "Tactical Dispositions" This one stresses putting yourself in a position where you cannot be defeated and waiting for the opportunity to defeat the enemy. It is about recognizing the breaks and taking them as opposed to creating the breaks. 5 - "Energy" This part focuses on the power of deception to lull the enemy into a false sense of security and the use of spies to learn the enemy's moves. It also stresses the need to evolve in battle. It's about building up war capability. 6 - "Weak Points and Strong" This chapter encapsulates all the previous five chapters into an advanced war strategy producing outcomes, calculating and responding to events as they unfold. The strategies are developed here. It is about creating breaks. 7 - "Maneuvering" This deals with managing units and the internal problems they face on top of how to respond during movement to various circumstances. It is a chapter based on types of situations and responses. 8 - "Variation of tactics" This section expands on the evolution of tactics and strategies based on situations and responses but concentrates on what causes failure. 9 - "The Army on the March" This is advanced maneuvering especially across long distances with different terrains and how to deal with encounters. It is about interpretation. 10 - "Terrain" This describes the various terrains that an army can encounter and when and how to occupy them. It talks about distances, potential dangers and obstructions. Positioning is important. 11 - "The Nine Situations" This piece explains the condition of each terrain in terms of its tactical advantages and disadvantages and how to deal with both. It is a very intensive chapter because of the number of complex conditions dealt with. 12 - "The Attack by Fire" Arson in war is probably the single most troubling weapon that an army could have inflicted on the enemy around 500 BC. This chapter is obviously based on the most advanced weapons of the time which have since been developed. It is about using the principle of creating disorder and chaos to win. 13 - "The Use of Spies" Without spies don't war. War is won based on foreknowledge not by calculation but by direct information about the plans of the other side from spies. Spies are managed in this chapter. Even though the work is quite short (about 100 pages or less with commentary) it is complex enough to warrant several readings. It is the equivalent to learning how to play advanced chess, a game which compliments this study. There is a lifetime of thought within the pages. Napoleon was said to have used it and lost when he didn't follow it. The Art of War has become one of the most important self help books of this century popularized in big business as many executives have had recourse to this material because it offers a sound winning strategy. Most readers come away believing that the book's message finds it adaptable to many environments because it is all about adjusting to variations and so can be applied to anything and everything. The Art of War is not supposed to be an exciting read. It is a strategy book, a step by step guide to how battles are won and why they are lost. It is more to be memorized as a set of responses, including when not to respond, than to be understood. The combinations of the responses are unlimited. There is enough on the plate without asking why. Understanding why would come later and the answers to these questions would come from a very sophisticated understanding of the theory. It is an endeavor that remains open to the reader if they can come to terms first with the information that is here. Even if the book is not followed up on by subsequent study it can still leave a long lasting impression with its tips on discipline and achieving goals. It is great value for the amount of information contained in such a short burst. It will get you thinking strategically and that is more or less its claim to fame.	1
The Art of War by SUN TZU is not fiction.  It's a Confucianist take on waging and winning wars (and business). It is important to compare this Eastern view of warfare with the western view as defined in The Prince and many subsequent titles. The heart of Sun Tzu's thought is "All warfare is based on deception. Thus, when able to attack, we must seem unable. Hold out bait to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is quick to anger, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant." Any football play has all kinds of people running around trying to fake the opposing team to going where the ball isn't. Perhaps the best strategic use of the principles was Ronald Reagon's Star Wars proposal. No one knew if it would work. But if it had, there was no way the Soviet Union could possibly have countered it. They didn't have the computer systems, and because of their closed society they didn't have the young kid genius programmers that we've developed in this country. Although there was an awful lot of complaining about Star Wars in the academic community in this country, it ended the cold war without a shot being fired.	1
I read the book while going through a very nasty divorce.  It helped me better understand that all battles aren't worth  fighting.  Despite a "perceived loss," sometimes it's better to not engage than fight a losing battle or a costly war.  That said, if a person is going to wage war, it clearly states that a person must be very well prepared... The Art of War is an excellent guide on managing conflict... Its message that resonated most with me was pursue peace.	1
This is a rather short book but the ideas have stood the test of time in warfare ever since it was written by Sun Tzu in 500 B.C.  This book has also been the "Bible" used to teach the winning principles of war down through the ages.Little ,if any, of the principles have changed,and if you look at any of the wars or battles over the centuries;you will see that the forces who won the wars,stayed true to these principles,while those who did not follow them were defeated.  Not only in warfare,but also in any form of contest from business,sports,politics,personal conflicts,etc.,the same principles can be applied and the same results will occur.  Of the plethora of books that have been written over the centuries,none has been better at outlining the principles of success and it would be well worth anyone's time to read and follow the advice and wisdom found in this classic treatise.	1
This is about war, but it is more about getting things done.  If you could only read 10 books in your lifetime, this book deserves to be on that list.  I learn something new, every time I read this book.  It is really neat.  I know a former state representative, who reads this every single day, and gets something new, every time.  , , , and other such classics owe something to this book.  It is simple, and profound.	1

Note: this is a LARGE PRINT edition. The Art of War (sun1 zi3 bing1 fa3 in pinyin with tone numbers, as Amazon doesn't like Chinese text), a book really more about recapturing peace than promoting war, despite its title, is still considered essential reading in the area of military studies. It is more than just ways to win; it's a treatise on humanity. There is not a single aspect of military positioning that Sun Tzu omits, something the Lionel Giles (this is a reprint of his 1910 translation) expresses wonderfully. There seems to be a frequent misconception that Tzu's work is somehow an Eastern version of Machiavelli's "The Prince." This could not be farther from the truth. One passage epitomizes this (again in pinyin): "gu4 yue1: zhi1 bi3 zhi1ji3, yi1bai3 zhan4 bu4 dai4; bu4zhi1 bi3 er2 zhi1ji3, yi1 sheng4 yi1 fu4; bu4zhi1 bi3, bu4zhi1 ji3, mei3 zhan4 bi4 dai4. gu4 yue1: zhi1 bi3 zhi1ji3, bai3zhan4bu4dai4; bu4zhi1 bi3 er2 zhi1ji3, yi1 sheng4 yi1 fu4; bu4zhi1 bi3, bu4zhi1 ji3, mei3 zhan4 bi4 dai4." My Chinese isn't great, but here's a basic translation: "one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not winning; defeating the enemy without battling is the pinnacle of victory." Whether you're planning on going into the military, need to replace your old, beaten-up copy, want to learn more about the Eastern mind, or just need a gift for an old veteran whose eyesight may be failing, this book is an essential addition to any bookshelf.	1
This book came up in so many "must read" lists. From business &  leadership to Bill Belichik talking about it's value. I finally took the time to read this book and I was blown away at how much I took from it. A great read that is more applicable than you would imagine.	1
This highly regarded and ancient work has been translated by Thomas Cleary with more subtle thought than other wooden stiff translations.  In addition to Cleary’s introductory commentary, there are commentaries from 9 Chinese sages, philosophers, military strategists that followed Sun Tzu. These commentaries were written over many years after Sun Tzu and often add depth and perception to the original short text.  A strength of Cleary’s perspective is the relationship of this classic piece of literature with Taoism. The secret of this book is that it is actually an anti-war book.  Throughout the book Master Sun urges caution, patience, calmness, preparation, thought, reflection, intelligence gathering, and avoidance of rash impulse and anger. It is this quality of the work, the Taoist philosophy that underlies the strategy, which would make this book of great interest to the corporate world. Master Sun advises on how to prepare for conflict, how to avoid it if at all possible, but if engaged in an unavoidable conflict, how to move forward with the greatest chance of victory.  Make no mistake, Master Sun does not have a simplistic view of victory since he reminds us that territory defeated must then become territory held, a vast task that requires different tactics.  Master Sun spends much of his book in regard to assessment.  Assessment of your own strengths and capacities, assessment of the enemy’s strengths and capacities, the use of a range of different types of spies, and other methods of assessment are discussed.  Master Sun believes that the more fore knowledge the general has, the better he can develop a winning strategy.  This leads to a second theme throughout the writing of Master Sun which is the need to develop a strategy for action before taking any action.  If anything, the book warns against anger and rash action, but rather the development of a strategy and the assessment of the opponent’s strategy.  Another strength is that Master Sun tells us that having more troops, more forts, more weapons, etc. is no guarantee of success and that it is the cognitive aspects of warfare that can make the essential difference. It is difficult to compare this book to that of Machiavelli’s The Prince since Machiavelli’s book deals with armed conflict but also with political infighting and the brutal necessities of ruling and leadership. Because war is a dirty wasteful business, Master Sun’s book could be considered a great anti-war book since he warns against anger and revenge and places the center of warfare in the human brain, not in the heated emotions.	1
Is anyone buying this book cause of Technoblade? 10/10 it won the potato wars.	1
A common sense approach to war. May it be with an army or interpersonal there is always a battle to be fought and won. Consider this a short and handy reference guide to outwit your opponent.	1
Obviously written about wartime tactics, but I actually saw a number of parts that applied to leadership within my corporate work environment. I understand that the translations to English are sketchy at places, but the fact that this edition had more footnotes and author commentary than actual content was quite annoying. I skimmed most of that and just read the introductions/history and the translation itself. If I were a general in the armed forces, I'm sure I would spend more time analyzing this and appreciate it more... But still good stuff.	1
We've all heard of this book; it's actually worth reading.  Even though Sun Tzu, if he existed at all, was roughly a contemporary of Homer and Isaiah, much of his advice seems pertinent today.  And, of course, the work is quite a window into Chinese culture and history.  The Kindle edition I read was initially published in 1910, translated by and including commentary by Lionel Giles.  Perhaps the oddest advice by Sun Tzu was for the general to keep his plans hidden from his own forces as well as those of the enemy; the most annoying characteristic (noted by Giles) is the typical Chinese approach of dividing a broad category (e.g., types of terrain) into a long list of subcategories that overlap but are not comprehensive.	1
This ancient book of military strategy has been followed by military men and businessmen for thousands of years-two notable ones being Generals MacArthur and Patton. This work is attributed to Sun Tzu, a high ranking general in China about 5,000 years ago, though several other strategists are also quoted. Master Sun believed that war was a necessary evil, and must be avoided whenever possible. He felt like capturing an army or city intact was far better than destroying it. His book outlines 13 chapters of military strategy, covering everything from morale, use of spies, to position and timing.	1
This book unfortunately seems to have been published before it was ready, as other reviewers also note. The elementary error on the Table of Contents page (with Chapter IX [9] appearing between Chapter IV [4] and Chapter V [5]) suggests no professional proofreader or editor involved.  The other spelling, grammatical, and content errors that appear in the text suggest that the material is a largely unchanged Project Gutenberg text file: [...] All in all, the publisher should really release a second edition that fixes the myriad easy to find errors.  Particularly since this book is obviously selling well and the publisher ought therefore have the funds with which to do so. In the meantime, a comparable edition at the same price (but properly proofread and corrected) is the Pax Librorum edition:   which is fully downloadable/previewable via a PDF eBook at the publisher's website.  Or just about any other one from more well-known and established publishers.	0
I am a high school science teacher. After reading this volume of The Art of War twice over two years, I realized that my teaching employs Sun Tzu's techniques. First and foremost, when you go to war, both sides have already lost. I have looked at other volumes and I'm sure they have their positives, but for the average Jane or Joe who wants the essence of Sun Tzu this is the volume. I have given away dozens of copies to various students over the years that I buy used online. I also sell my honey and produce at a local farmer's market. I tell my students that business is legalized warfare. Again, Sun Tzu is there to give tips on product competition, pricing and grower reputation. James Clavell was brilliant in this edition of a centuries popular text.	1
Badly formatted. Only a tiny fraction of the book is original source material the rest is verbose prologue and the editor's own explanation of every single quote. We can't just relax and read the original, the editor is there on every page trying too dissect and analyze every word.	0
I had heard a lot of praise about this historic book before cracking it open.  The principles came across as valuable as a social tool for me that I can implement as a father, a businessman, and a coach.  In terms of the value of the lessons taught within the Art of War, my expectations were met precisely. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized how easy to read the book was.  The breaking into verses and chapters made it feel a lot like scripture, which is, to me, an easy format to read.  Every copy of the Art of War I have seen has different commentary in the back; in my instance, the commentary had some valuable material, but altogether was not worth my time reading.  If you want to get smarter, read the Art of War!	1
Crazy but true this book helped me during my divorce. I read it and realized how many of the tips about "war" can be used in everyday struggles. I liked his tip about boring a person so they lose interest in you. Also fake weakness when you are strong or be fake being strong when you are weak. It sounds wild but, i divorced a narcissist and believe me some of it was useful. A good read for interest as well. It is a classic!	1
Did not read the reviews, which I normally do, didn't know it was a pamphlet.	0
AP World History Book Review: Put honestly, I am a student using my parent's account who needs to write this review for a history class, but don't think that changes my opinion of the book. All in all, I found reading this book, or more accurately, treatise a thoroughly enlightening experience. Not only did it provide a rare insight into life back then through the eyes of a general, but it also manages an astounding feat which few other novels can accomplish: It is still accurate and relevant over two thousand years later. I will say that if your aim is to learn about the time period, there are better choices, but it was not written as a historical record. The general style feels as if it is simply giving you advice, and the fact that it is written in some sort of almost-second-person-but-also-kind-of-first-person style means that it feels like you’re having a conversation with Tzu. All things considered, I would certainly recommend reading this 2400-year-old military and political treatise.	1
The last place one would think to get advice and strategies to handle an undesirable work situation. The timing could not be more perfect for I fear, I am fighting my own warfare -- one of the mind, and often unwitty comments from an unmentioned co-worker. The battlefield is in an office space instead of a faraway country.	1
They are just seemingly random pictures from ancient China and have no relation to anything in the text.  The text itself is well formated if you want to read all of the annotations and asides (and I found most of them quite helpful in understanding the various interpretations of the text and the choices the translator made when bringing it to English. However, if you just want the translation of the original text without interruption, this may not be the version for you. It would have been best to have set the asides into an annotation section and provide links to them from within the text as I have seen done in other Kindle versions. If this is ever updated to do that or if the illustrations had more to do with the text instead of feeling tacked on for the sake of selling this as an illustrated version then I could happily change my rating to five stars.	1
The Art of War is a must-read book by anyone who love The Romance of Three Kingdoms, popular chivalry story based on the history of 3rd century China. I think it is a wise idea to read this Chinese classic from Thomas Cleary Translation. Had I encountered this from Archaic worded Japanese version I might not get so immersed into it. Cleary translation is really understandable even to non-native English speaker like me. Also it is great idea that the interpretation of notables including Cao Cao comes after the Master Sun's text. Comparing interpretation is really a fun. What I am impressed most about this book is it says that if you can avoid the war better not to fight. And its idea of how to manage an army is really close to modern idea of organizing groups particularly business corporations. Verdict: Nice gateway to Chinese classics Rating: 90 out of 100 Recommended for wide variety of Chinese literature and classic books fans.	1
The original book written in Chinese is a great strategy book, however, the English translation in this version is so poor that it is obvious that the translator did not fully comprehend nor being able to convey the essense of these strategies. Keep in mind that Chinese language must be taken in its entire context, not seperated into individual characters and then translated word for word. What the translator has done in this case is equivalent to, for example, when English speakers say "Today, it rained cats and dogs", the translator automatically translated into "Today, it rained cats (as in the sense of house pet) and dogs (as in the sense of house pet)" instead of translating into "Today, it rained heavily". Another version of translation published by Publisher Cloud Hands (see Amazon [amazon.com/gp/product/0974201324])  seem to do a much better job than this version. So don't waste your money on this version.	0
This is a well-edited edition of Sun Tzu; the only aspect that left something to be desired was the inclusion of illustrative anecdotes; I would have preferred if they were left to the end of the chapter. I can understand why this book was a fad in the business world but object to claims that the tactics described in this book are easily applied to business.  This is a book about conflict, specifically, war, and there is much wisdom lost if it is taken out of its context.  There is much excellent advice for analogous situations; political persuasion and debate, games of Go, Shogi or Chess, or even sporting events. When taken from the world of conflict to the business, the realm of cooperation (in the sense that competing businesses compete to cooperate the best with their customers), The Art of War becomes yet another tome of "Eastern" sayings which sound pretty and can be "applied to any situation" only because they come to mean very little. Those who will be in a conflict situation or wish to prepare for one, even if it is a simple game of Go, should study this book.  Read the text and the anecdotes, and come back later to read it again gaining fresh insight.	1
I bought/"gifted" this version for all my junior NCOs.  I would give it to them on a Friday and I would have them brief me on what they read and how it could relate to them and all the way up to how it can apply to militaries as a whole.  I must of bought at least 20 to 30 copies of this in the past.  It is concise andan easy read.  I also have 10 different versions of "The Art of War" through different interpretations.  This by far the best!  It would be nice if Amazon put this in Kindle format, I would buy it the day it comes out.	1
This book on War is much like the Prince - you can wage war for good or evil. The Prince is a 'how to' book for evil Princes - and if you don't believe me, read your history. One of the best books I read after this one was about the family that Machiavelli consulted for and wrote the Prince for and about, the Borgia's. Its an example of The Art of War Check it out: Machiavelli's Disciple: The True Story of the Borgia Pope   You will be astounded!	1
I purchased this book at my local Borders Bookstore, and after reading the text, was very happy to have spent the price it is worth. There were two people on this page, who gave the book low ratings. After reading what they had to say, I can tell you that they don't understand "The Art of War", or how to apply it to our life today. You see philosophy isn't just books written to give you an easy path through life. No! Philosophy is meant to get the reader thinking and to take what was said and learned before and apply it to their life today. Sort of like what Bruce Lee said, "absorb what is useful". This means take what applies to your life, or what you can use in your life, and forget about the rest, it doesn't matter to you. I would recommend this book for those who are interested in Chinese history, military history, and philosophy. No matter what you are interested in, you won't go wrong by buying this book.	1
I'm not sure if this is the actual version I wanted to read, and with that said, maybe didn't get the gist of the Art of War.	0
I was expecting it to be more In depth and deeper but Found it to be short and even though it is illustrated I am not so sure if this is the go all end all for "The Art of War". Maybe since my little hardcover book is a Compressed and "Abridged" or shorter version of the translation I am not sure but either way I found it insightful but certainly not what I was expecting. The foreword to my version talks about Fidel and Mao who used the art of war among many others,I don't know why this evil is mentioned,All in All not what I expected.	1
I feel the preponderance of business books has built up the original too much in my mind. It just felt very dry. Very boring. No, it's not a novel meant to entertain, but I expected some modicum of enjoyment out of it. Plus, given the passage of time and the nature of war, it's not really that relevant anymore. So while others may rave about this, I just...can't. It's not worth it, and the hype really needs to die down already.	0
This edition is not an abridged version. This is the FULL, COMPLETE & ORIGINAL text. Apparently another reviewer wasn't too familiar with this work as it isn't overly large but that's the way the complete version is. Go complain to Sun Tzu! :-) This edition is exactly what I wanted. It's the complete text, and nicely designed, too. While "The Art of War" was originally intended as a book of military strategy, it is today more frequently used as an invaluable guide for business strategy. Highly recommended!	1
Each section is profound and applicable to almost any endeavor. The context and translation is illuminating to an otherwise inaccessible text.	1
Just buy Sun Tsu.  Still a good read and does quote Sun Tsu. But if on a budget this will give you good quality info.	1
Not the best version of the book	0
I got this particular edition of Sun Tzu's Art of War at a strategy course for sales. I already had a copy of it at home, but this edition is so nicely done that I gave my old copy away and kept this one. The introduction of James Clavell is a nice touch. It is amazing to me that this book is not read in high schools or colleges in favor of Machiavelli's work (The Prince or The Art of War.) Sun Tzu's writing is clear and to the point. Unlike the popular Book of Five Rings by Musashi, this book is not metaphorical and poetic; it's downright practical. And it's not hard to read, unlike many classics. If you are doing business in China, this is also a good book to know. I mentioned some of the classic strategies while giving a course in China, and every member of the class had read it, knew it well, and gave me many examples from recent Chinese history where Sun Tzu's strategies were employed. This book is close to their hearts, and will give you insight if you are doing business in the East. Of course, the most famous anecdote from this book is about gaining the obedience of troops; the emperor, wishing to interview Sun Tzu for the commission of general, asked if Sun Tzu's military principles could be applied to women. Sun Tzu replied yes, the principles worked for women as well as men. Accordingly, Sun Tzu was given the task of organizing the emperor's many concubines into an army. Sun Tzu lined up the concubines and set the two favorites as officers at the head of the columns. He gave them a simple set of orders to march and drill (eyes front, right face, about face. The drums sounded and instead of following the commands, the girls simply giggled and blushed. He repeated the orders again, saying that if the orders were not clear, it is first the fault of the general. He repeated the commands, and the girls simply stood and giggled again.  "If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers."  Upon saying this, he ordered the two concubines at the head of the troop, favorites of the emperor, to be beheaded. The emperor hurriedly sent down the command to stop, he had no desire to see his favorites executed. The emperor said "We are satisfied that the general knows how to command." But Sun Tzu said, "Once having received the commission, there are certain commands I am unable to accept." And he ordered the two favorites to be beheaded. Once again, he gave the commands. The concubines marched, whirled about and drilled in perfect order.  The emperor appointed Sun Tzu general.	1
Few of the classics have that timeless quality that a reader finds enduring. The Art of War is one of those, with its wisdom and lessons in how to predict what your enemies will do, and common-sense advice on how to avert disaster. This book has long been a favorite of business executives and entrepreneurs, and I highly recommend its wisdom to anyone in the present day who is trying to make their way in an uncertain and unpredictable world economy. This is an easy to read book suitable to people from any walk of life. Arm yourself with it and use it wisely.

My history with the book is listening to is a tape deck version of Lionel Giles reading of Art of War. Product Review: Product casing; Case outside is paper with a sleeve inside containing the 2 CDs, but has room to store up to 4 CDs. Product itself; This new version gives readers spectacular ambience with the reading. 1) There are 4 voices within the reading. B.D Wong I believe is the younger sounding voice, his reading adds a little bit of Asian highlights giving more life to the books reading. Ron Silver I believe is the older sounding low voice, his reading adds a relaxing, clear understanding of the language and tone of the book. Both readers do a very good job. The other two voices read commentaries, quotes and questions. Stefan Rudnicki has a rugged voice deeper low voice. Shauna Zurbrugg is the only female voice and gives something different from the male voices. There sounds like a 5th voice at times, but no other reader is mentioned. 2) There is subtle music in the beginning/end of chapters; it would seem to be an Asian decent lullaby. 3) There is no static whatsoever, so it's truly a digital mastered recording. 4) The chapters are separated so you can skip to which chapter you want to hear. If you're trying to decide between the many copies of this book, I'd suggest this one if the price is the same or very close as you will be happy and satisfied. If a price is substantially different go with the cheaper one as most readings are very similar for this book in the two readers I have come across.	1
I assume amazon is once again shadily mixing reviews because some of the other reviews clearly read a different book than me. The translation is all over the place, in some places it's fine yet in others grammar, syntax, and even the basic vocabulary is lost. If you want an idea of how much proofreading was done prior to release, let me give you the chapter order. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 - I'm not joking, they didn't even manage to count to 5 right. I wish I had had a chance to read this before the return date passed, this literary abortion would have gone straight back to the cheap, illiterate womb from which it came...	0
The first time I read this book I found it amazing. Sun Tzu was an extraordinary master of the topic. Many world leaders of the past and the present have found inspiration throughtout these pages. This book has transformed the vision of many people, even the common citizen. If you want to gain knowledge and manage art of living facing every day inner war The Art of War is yours!!	1
Difficult to read.  But very insightful.  The strategy of modern warfare.  Discussed by Asian warlord a thousand years a go.	1
Can’t remove it from my queue	1
I read a translation of this book, here in Brazil. Being writen in China, more than 2,500 years ago, this book is a proof that a great book doesn't gets older. The focus of this book is military tactics, but it is usefull for everyone. United States of America won World War III or Cold War, following the advice of this book: The biggest military conquest is to win, without fighting. And this book is full of great advices for any commander. You must know your enemy is one of these advices. Such as the Bible, this Sun Tzu's book is forever.	1
Simply put, this book contains a great deal of useful wisdom.  This information is presented in short sentences and statements, so do not expect lengthy dialogue and is most likely a cliff note version of the original but still worth a few dollars.  Some of it is obvious and commonsensical whereas other points may be obscure or not obvious to the reader.  Regardless, for those who have interest in warfare and strategy it is worth reading.	1
A book about drug lords in North Dakota	1
This is a great book for learning  the tactics of war from the eyes of a general, it can apply to daily life under the right circumstances and helps me get a grasp of war and its inner workings.	1
This book has much wisdom for today even though it was written so long ago. I was able to draw many parallels not only to the war situation of today, but also to the business world as well. I will admit that there were times that I thought the book was communicating more than I was receiving. While it is a short book, for the full impact to be felt, it is one that needs to be taken slowly and in short bursts in my opinion. Since the wisdom has transcended time, it truly is a classic.	1
An excellent way to come across as a learned individual without actually having to obtain a degree in literature! The perfect vehicle to aid you in exploiting western society's fetishisation of people who can rattle off seemingly-profound quotes or make obscure literary references. Are you a STEM PhD looking to match one of those English/literature majors in displaying a facade of cultured sensitivity? This is the book for you!	1
You can easily overlook the depth of this work as it is quite a short and simple read. However in terms of symbolism it can be related to many aspects of life and strategy applied past the battlefield. I think given the knowledge return on investment for such a quick read, everyone should read it at least once. I plan to revisit it now and again to look for additional meaning.	1
I bought this book because its commonly recommended for managers. I'ts honestly the DUMBEST thing i have ever read.  Maybe if you consider management to be some kind of battle field, this might make sense to you.  For me, this line of thinking represents everything thats backwards and nonsensical in managerial thinking -- so.... good luck with it.	0
Great principles	1
For some reason, chapter 9 is put in between chapters 4 and 5.  I researched this to see if this is common with other editions, and it is not.  There is no information or explanation as to why this was done, and it is noted in the table of contents, which tells me it was done deliberately.  I am likely going to return this item and find a copy that has everything in the correct order.	0
A definite must have for anyone in any field or curriculum	1
Classic book about the mental and tactical aspects of battle. Great read	1
If I wanted cliff notes, I would have googled. This is a piece of garbage.	0
This book is a must for history buffs and students of life. The 2000 year old principles still apply today. The concepts touch on how to think like a leader and apply strategies for life and war. Sometimes the two are the same. This large print edition is a condensed primer that will enlighten you while helping improve your own strategic thought processes.	1
Lo que aparece en esa pelicula se puede aplicar a casi cualquier situación de la vida.	1
what a classic piece!  i ordered this through my kindle for $0, so, the price was perfect!  honestly, i can not comment on the quality of the translation.  i assume that it is accurate.  i found that it was a fast read, until i stopped and thought about what he was saying.  the author's comments often coincided with the places where i felt the need to stop and reflect.  this was superb and it is a book that i intend to re-read.  while i prefer peace to war, the content herein can be applied to even peaceful efforts.  i highly recommend this book for every cadet in the academies and junior officers.  everybody else with an interest in the strategies and tactics of competitive engagement also would benefit from reading this.  i give this a solid "A".	1
A common sense guide to the embattled leader.  In this classic, the reader will find advice on building alliances, considering advantages and disadvantages, maintaining morale, maintaining discretion, avoiding self-glory, and adapting to ever-changing circumstances.  All of these qualities are necessary in business and life.	1
Going in, my expectations were high -- The Art of War is praised as an all-time classic; equally applicable today as when it was first written; a philosophical insight into all manners of conflict, including business and (some have claimed) even romance! I did not find all of these things, here. Instead, I found a brief and simple outline of various battle tactics and tautologies, usually on the level of the field general. This is not to say that this is worthless, or that there is no way of taking the information and applying it -- via analogy -- to problems today. But I did not find it compellingly analogous to today's world, or no more so than any number of older works. The Art of War is a short, fast read. It is worth reading for its historical significance, and for a few insights that are not strictly obvious, and some of it may be applicable (with some mental stretching) to your quest to be promoted to the next level of management, or romantic victory over a rival, or whatever it is in your life that approximates "war." If other people find profound, life-altering depth in its lists of the types of terrain, or observations that it's better to attack your foe when they're tired, rather than well-rested, etc., then more power to them. I feel it's possible, however, that some of this depth lies more in the creative extrapolations of the reader than in the work itself.	1
If you're looking to unlock the arcane secrets of modern warfare, this is probably not the book for you. Much of the information in this book applies to ancient chinese warfare and general strategy/tactics, as can be expected. Still a decent read.	1
Great and quick read. It is a bit of a rough translation but for the most part you get the message. Id heard a lot of this book and glad I finally gave it a read.	1
I checked out the free sample and it's a copy of the free edition already available through project guttenberg and is free through Amazon! So why would anyone pay even a dollar? It says it's an updated version, but frankly I saw no updates in the sample I downloaded, it was *exactly* the same as the free copy I already had...except for the jacket cover which with my kindle is utterly useless! I wouldn't pay a dollar also on principle, what work have they done to merit it? I couldn't see any. If it's there, it's not obvious in the sample. Avoid.	0
C'mon if you haven't read this u need to push that rock out of your way.	1
I am going to talk about what is The Art Of War for people who has not read it yet. Other reviews on the same page says enough about the edition and publication. The Art Of War by Sun Tzu is a precious material to study for military theoriees, decoding how people think and that certain period of acient Chinese history. I have read the original( Chinese version)and been taught some of it in high school. To get the most out of your interactions with others, this text will give you the tools to make things go your way. The text would teach you how to make a plan for anything in daily life and usually that plan would works if ur are basicly smarter than your opponents. You can consider yourself as a nation in the text, which makes your move in your work become the army in the text. Also socially relationships would be like politics or diplomacy in the book. However, In the acient wars between nations, there is no ethic. But you are the key to make it useful in a good way. I suggest audience of Sun Tzu to do a little research on Sun Tzu's private life. There were a lot of interesting events happened, knowing which will be a great help on understanding The Art Of War further.	1
For centuries, people have been referencing Sun Tzu to either contradict and justify or even glorify war. However, I think his most influential work responds only to an era that no longer exists and an era that we shouldn't keep on reviving. We must embrace a new system of thought or more applicable political theory.	1
The Art of War has in recent decades been applied to such modern day problems as politics and business - really anything where conflict can surface.  It was also suggested reading during my entire time in business school.  So, I finally pulled the trigger and read the "original" (or at least the most well-regarded translation) The Art of War.  The most impressive thing to me (which is explained in the introductory material) is how well the Chinese recorded their history.  My only complaint about the introductory materials was that most great Chinese historical figures have multiple names - this makes it hard to track who is who in some of the commentaries.  The actual strategies themselves are full of guidelines on determining your opponent's weaknesses, exploiting them and achieving victory.  Not exactly full of moral or ethical advice, so I can't use much of it.  I'm glad that I read it as it gave me a great look into Chinese history...but its practical use in my world is limited.	1
I love "The Art of War" specifically for making you read it SLOWLY... You can breeze through it in 5 minutes, but it was really meant to take a dose-a-day of it, ponder on the connection to your personal life and do your own interpretation. This is also why I particularly liked this edition, which doesn't include any notes, historical contexts, introductions etc. It really doesn't need any - the words speak for themselves if you just listen close enough... And it makes the book small and carryable in my bag for the right moment when I can take a sip of wisdom.	1
Classic great read	1
In a time when competition is at its highest, it's even more important to go back to a time when the battle was for life or death.  If you're in SALES, you need to adopt the teachings of The Art of War to win when you can't, to win when you lose, and to win more when you win.  The art of "peacefully coexisting" will help your clients win and with better results.  When your clients know that you are in it for them and willing to coexist with your competition, who wins?  Everyone.  Read the book or get the audio book and you'll understand why.  Your client's will appreciate it and so will your bank account.	1
FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!  THIS IS AN ADDICTION SELF HELP BOOK WITH SOME CLIFF NOTES FROM THE REAL BOOK IN THE BACK, DO NOT BUY!!!	0
This is the old, public domain translation of The Art of War. I had to return this book, along with a few others which suffer from this problem. Luckily, Amazon handled the exchange of the two books I had to return promptly. As to the The Art of War itself, it is of course the most important work on military philosophy ever written (at least that's what my husband told me to write). I am plowing through the other deluxe edition I received instead of this one with the errors, but so far it is just as fascinating as the special about The Art of War I saw on the History Channel.	1
This ancient classic of 13 chapters was written over 2,500 years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu. It is a must have for military buffs that enjoy reading about the tactics of the most succesful generals. It is rumored that Napoleon used a French translation of the Art of War to his advantage while conquering most of Europe, and he lost when he broke its principles. The principles that are with in this ancient text can also be used in games of strategy, business conflicts, and the day to day battles of life. Here are ten principles to give you a sample of the wisdom found in its pages: Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance with out fighting. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. Spies are the most important element in war, because upon them depends an army's ability to move. All warfare is based on deception. The general who wins a battle makes many calculations before the battle is fought. There is no instance of a country having benefited from a prolonged war. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. In war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. (So they can retreat). Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained, fight not unless the position is critical. Taken as a whole this is a book of wisdom and principles on how to win. I rank it in my top ten books I have ever read. It is a must have for any home library. The is a very small book that is quick and easy to read.	1
I have read several translations of The Art of War and Thomas Cleary's version is by far the best. It is a book to be read and reread, time and time again; focused, concerted and rich in understanding the nature and expression of resistance and conflict. Regardless of whether you are interested in deep confrontation, battle or war, this excellently edited edition will have something of interest for you. Published primarily for use in world philosophy and studied at military universities and academies around the world, this book is very constructive in providing a well researched, diversion sampling from one of the most important theorists in the field, Sun Tzu (544 BC - 496 BC). Although the philosophies contained in this text can be challenging at times, in the end the perceptive is absolute. As the seriousness of our global problems persist and even worsen, this book will continue to be a highly informative source of information for leaders and citizens for years to come. And for those who are looking for a more methodical approach to examining our relationship with the world, as opposed to the more publicized takes, this book will be especially valued.	1
Basic learning when it comes to tactfully maneuvering the business world, personal life or any other relationship. Classic and a great read.	1
Good	1
Love it	1
This is propaganda. Hating on the Japanese and all, how despicable.	0
Very inspirational. Allowed my wife and I to learn more about psychology and how often many play a victim versus the threat. Also goes into detail about being focus and it allowed us to have a better in site in other people behavioral patterns. Plus it's just an awesome novel.	1
Two points in this book:  Know your enemy, and Only fight when you can win, speak volumes to how the NVA fought the Vietnam war. They were very consistent in fighting on their terms, and only when it was advantageous to them.	1
this is a amazing book ,hard strategies but easy to understand .  Sun Tzu is a genius and was a great General.This free edition comes with everything included.a great read and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good book to read	1
Instead of being too late, sacrifice whatever is not coming along right in the moment that presents an opportunity, or everything might fall into the hands of the enemy. Monetary mushroom clouds work according to the strategies in this book.	1
Battle of the Sexes, I could relate to this as a strategy for family and relationship disputes and business decisions, remain faithful to the mission	1
This is an awesome book and a great gift idea. However, I paid 4.00 for mine on Amazon so anything more than that is crazy.	1
Great read	1
Hard to read but can't stop trying.	0
Sun Tzu begins his treatise by saying that "The art of war is of vital importance to the State. A matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin." Sun Tzu says that the art of war is governed by five factors. These are: (1) The Moral Law - this causes people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives. (2) Heaven - stands for the seasonal conditions. (3) Earth - stands for the physical terrain ("distances great and small, open ground and narrow passes.") (4) The Commander - the virtues of the military commander. (5) Method and discipline - the marshalling of the army and its divisions (logistics, expenditure) Sun Tzu says that all warfare is based on deception. The objective of war is victory. Sun Tzu says that if the campaign is long-drawn-out, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain. Sun Tzu says that there is no instance of a country benefiting from prolonged warfare. Sun Tzu says that there is no merit in fighting and conquering. Merit consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting. Sun Tzu quotes the proverb "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat." Sun Tzu says that "The fighters must first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then wait for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by a mistake on the enemy's part." Security against defeat implies defensive tactics, and the ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive. Battles are won by committing no mistakes. Sun Tzu says that in war the strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas the one destined to defeat first fights and looks for victory afterwards! Sun Tzu says that in war the direct method may be used for commencing battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. There are only two methods of attack - the direct and the indirect - but in combination these give rise to an endless series of strategies. Sun Tzu says that one can be sure of success if one only attacks places which are undefended (weak points). On the other hand, the safety of the defense can be ensured only if one holds positions that cannot be attacked (strong points). Sun Tzu says that if one knows the place and the time of the coming battle, one can marshal one's forces from afar. Sun Tzu advices the general not to repeat the tactics (that have gained one victory) again and again. The way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak - like water, taking the line of least resistance. Sun Tzu says that maneuvering with a disciplined army is advantageous, but with an undisciplined multitude most dangerous. An army without its supply-train, without provisions and without bases of supply is lost. Forming a single cohesive body, it is impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. Sun Tzu says that it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Sun Tzu says that the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. Sun Tzu says that five faults must be avoided: Recklessness, Cowardice, A hasty temper, A (false) sense of honor and Over concern for one's troops. Sun Tzu says that if fighting is sure to result in victory, then the general must fight even though the ruler forbids it; if fighting will not result in victory, then the general must not fight even at the ruler's commands. The general must advance without coveting fame and retreat without fearing disgrace. Sun Tzu says that rapidity is the essence of war. And that the army must be kept continually on the move. Sun Tzu says that a spirit of enterprise must be cultivated if one wants to succeed in the attack and win the battle. Otherwise, war is just a waste of time and will lead to a stalemate. Sun Tzu warns that the general should be fully prepared for war - because a kingdom that has been destroyed can never again come into being, and the dead can not be brought back to life. For those interested in the study of war and war strategy, you can't do without this book...	1
Cheap edition of a classic text. The information is all there, but it's riddled with typos.	1
I bought this as a gift for my son who just took over as CEO for a multinational manufacturing operation. Hopefully this will be as helpful to him as "The Prince" was. As always, packaging and delivery was flawless. Way to go Amazon!	1
I've read several interpretations and translations of The Art of War. Although this is not the most famous presentation, it is quite informative and is, by far, the most enjoyable.	1
This book is red by almost every officer during his or her life. It contains so much valuable info about war strategy and life in general​.	1
This is a good read with many proverbs and sayings that are still applicable to modern times.  Sun Tzu is vague, and it for that very reason that this book is ever-lasting. Also recommended: The 36 strategies, The book of five rings (Go Rin No Sho), and the Hagakure.	1
Wasn't what I expected but informational and to the point. Makes me want to fight lol	1
Love this book. It can be used in all fields of work.	1
Great book	1
Very good book	1
No pictures whatsoever	1
Having read about a half dozen versions of The Art of War... most with extensive footnotes and difficult translations, I found that this version, which was supplied to us at Motorola on a training session, was my clearest and practical read.	1
Good explanations as well	1
Granted, most readers will find some wisdom in "The Art of War"; on the other hand, perhaps most of this "wisdom" is simply common sense dressed up in militaristic metaphors. I know that some of the popularity behind this book stems from the fact that plenty of its readers (usually male) are hip-hop figures, business types, and budding entrepreneurs. I'm sure the occasional gang leader took some leadership cues from Sun Tzu (was there really a Sun Tzu?) and this probably created an almost cult-like devotion to an "ok" book. I believe it's not quite one of the best leadership books ever, as some might suggest. Read it to relieve your curiosity, then delve into more modern tomes by folks such as Seth Godin or Guy Kawasaki if you're looking to start a business in today's world. In addition, you'll gain still more by reading biographies by one of today's business leaders.	0
It's a classic that you can read in under an hour. One of the best books I have read. Simple, basic, and a great strategy foundation. I refer to it all the time. Great book from a historical standpoint, but certainly is a great asset in business.	1
As a business major, The Art of War is an excellent tool when it comes to strategizing. However, this book goes beyond the professional. On a personal level, Sun Tzu's writings can apply to all aspects of life and it certainly has helped me. I can only imagine how effective this book is for the military...	1
This book is amazing, something everyone should read. For philosophy and life, this book is a must read.	1
This is well known as the classic text on the subject of both war and business.  There's much wisdom here and you don't have to be a corporate psychopath to appreciate it.  Tony Morphett	1
I was expecting this book to be more interesting than it was.  I had just read The Prince by Machiavelli and really enjoyed it, but The Art of War was just less interesting in my opinion.  The most memorable part is early on when Sunzi demonstrates his leadership by training the king's concubines to obey the orders of a general.  That story is definitely worth a look.	1
I was expecting more from this book. Doesn't look like a lot of work went into making this.	1
I love this book. It basically tells you how to win at war and it is fun just to read, but it is especially good if you want to win at something. It doesn't have to be war. Anything that requires strategy. It has much wisdom. I do have complaints though. In this print of it, there are far too many notes. one fellow said that this was the footnotes. That is not true. There is a ton of notes put in at the beginning, though, (many pages) so I can see how someone could make that mistake. It is a great book over all, but it doesn't need nearly as many notes as it has.	1
The "translator" decided to spend most of his time creating his own content and offering a self serving history lesson rather than just letting the text work as it has for centuries.	0
There are translations about other masters and theologists about what the words Master Sun was saying, not just Master Suns words alone. This is not just a guide to waging warfare, but to corperate life, everyday life, and every aspect fo day to day living. This is deep Taoist philosophy, so prepare to be enlightened! A true timeless classic.	1
This is a great book. The advice is timeless and not always what you'd first expect. It has stood well through time and most translations.	1
Mandatory military read. All those who have served, will serve, and are serving, regardless of rank should add this to your professional materials and read.	1
The book is really presented in a beautiful format. Nice Book- For Library- But, The reading can change your tactic about life in General- A Must Read - Over & Over & Over Rodney- McAllen-Texas	1
Everyone should read this book at some point in their lives.  Even just one page if that's all you have time for.	1
If you know anything about the Art of War it's from quotations taken out of context that seem to say something and seem to be profound.  The idea is that actual war is a metaphor for the conflicts that one encounters in life and that the advice and tactics are just as applicable. Not really. This is a book about medieval Chinese warfare and by and large most of it is about precisely that, maybe ninety five percent.  If you want to find out how to get good at business, read a business book.  And if you want to get good at life, maybe get a self-help book.  If you are mostly interested in the history of the era, this is it.	1
Great book.	1
ON A 2006 FORD MUSTANG, YOU MUST REMOVE CLEAR LENSE AND SHOVE INTO SOCKET. LIGHTS STAYED ON DIMMLY AT FIRST, BUT MY CAR FIXES HERSELF.	1
Interesting Read.	1
Good price.	1
can be applied to real life situations	1
Some translation issues in this I think but you still get a good sense of the book. I have read it in 3 other versions and this is not my favorite.	1
This is just that stategies for war. I liked it because it gave me different look at any kind of conflict and what I need to consider prior to everyday conflicts.	1
Concise and accessible version of such the famous and prestigious jewel of Oriental and military literature. Certainly, Two thumbs up!	1
you can learn not only stuff about war, but can also apply this to daily life. using these techniques, you can be anything you set out to be. i highly recommend this book.	1
Seriously? They list this for sale!? Shameful.  Accidentally clicked on it. Accidental purchase.  Awaiting refund. Why would anyone buy this book when it is freely available in public domain with free quality downloads everywhere?  Title: The Art of War by Sun Tzu, Best translation by Lionel Giles, 1910. Free at both Gutenberg dot org and archive dot org. Listed under the heading: "Sunzi bing fa. English"	0
The seller was great! Shipped very fast. Just wasn't expecting it to be such a short book! Again everything was great unfortunately the book itself was kind of a let down.	1
My second book!	1
This book keeps appearing on my device but not on my amazon website account. Anyway, it seems this book would be better titled "the art of mastering your ego: cultivate the wisdom your aggressor cannot"	0
I enjoyed reading the philosophy about how to be an effective leader and the mindset to succeed in battle and in life.	1
Classic wisdom for war and life.	1
Wonderful book.	1
I aspire to cook like her one day. BEAUTIFUL BOOK. INSPIRING.	1
Excellent would purchase it again.	1
The Art of War is a book that you can take certain principles from and apply them to everyday life involving adapting and strategizing toward those who you consider an enemy. It's also a book that involves tactic about warfare itself, but it based on the reader's perception of how they choose to use it.	1
bought as a present for someone	1
this paperback description says it was written 2000 years ago, but if you click on the hardback version, its 2500 years ago.	1
Great book	1
good reading	1
 This book gives you the basics in a very supplier And logical way to grasp	1
Great book	1
A must read. For everyone. There are principles that everyone can use.	1
Everyone should read this, of course. Fast, fast delivery!! thx!	1
A must have classic.	1
Outstanding read!	1
I didn't order this.	0
I was disappointed when I started reading this book and only'd turned two pages when the book ended. I was angry. I hadn't wasted any money, because it was free, but I'd wasted time. This book doesn't even really have one sentence, and I can't see why some other reviewers said this raggedy book was informative and understandable. Don't buy this book.	0
Those who love this book should now read "The Art of Non War - by Kim Michaels. The art of war was written from an UNBALANCED state of consciousness - the state of consciousness which states that we are separate beings, separated from our planet and each other. Nothing can be further from the TRUTH. Without me having to go into any lengthy explanation, the books Infinite Mind by Valarie Hunt and The Biology of Belief by Bruce H. Lipton - PhD (including Dr. Lipton's YouTube presentation) should be read...in addition to viewing the YouTube video "Earth Seen From Space" Keep in mind Einstein's equation which states that EVERYTHING is energy therefore, our life experience and the life of the planet it's self is based upon the interaction of the various energy systems. Sand storms in the Sahara desert find it's way into the Amazon jungle AND northeastern states in the US - along with all the pollutants emitted from bombs exploded in the middle east and transported to the Sahara by the jet streams in that region, thus affecting weather conditions WORLD WIDE So think twice before we support nuking anyone in that part of the world and / or using munitions manufactured from spent nuclear fuel. there is NO art in war...only death and destruction for ALL	0
Good read	1
Great read.	1
Tiny book, but good reading.	1
clear and concise.	1
very thin book, not alot of pages... also chapter 9 (the army on the march) comes right after chapter 4 in place of chapter 5 . I will probably end up donating this version and purchasing a better edition for my collection.	0
Cool	1
Lil bit confusing but the chapter regarding grounds is very useful The chapter about converting spies also makes sense. Nice.	1
great book i loved it so much i read it from front to back in one day. it was cool	1
I truly enjoyed this book. It is unlike any book I have ever read. But I found so many relevancies to my career, my journeys competing in pageant (which is a war within itself) and my life. When I heard it referenced by our President elect, while I was reading it, I knew I was right up there with the world's leaders. I recommend everyone from teens to adults read this book.	1
A great book, adapted and translated directly from the initial writing itself. As a result, the text gets right to the point. No fluff, filler, or individual interpretation; just the meat and potatoes, the way this type of book should be. Substitute: tanks for "chariots" and guns for "spears" and the book is easily adaptable in todays modern world.	1

this is an excellent book. highly recommended	1
Being a negotiation specialist (and author on Amazon), I read the hardcopy of this book from cover to cover. It is true that the book is celebrated as a classic (written over 2500 years ago and still on the Amazon Best Seller List (Negotiation category) - WOW!! Probably the Bible alone was more popular). And it is also true (I checked) that this book had influence on mostly Chinese and Japanese negotiation styles in the later part of the 20th century (today – not really, see below). But if you want to read this book in order to actually learn negotiations from it - you couldn't be more wrong, with all due respect to Mr. Tzu. "The Art of War" is about - newsflash - how to battle your wars better (as in REAL wars). Tzu was a proclaimed Chinese General from the 6th century BC. His book gives the best advice to the audience he intended it to be for: combat Generals. He addresses issues like how to seize a fortress or city, the importance of information security, when is the best time to attack (answer: in the evening) and the likes. From reading it, it doesn't seem Tzu had ANY INTENTION of writing a book on negotiation and certainly makes almost NO REFERENCE to negotiations, in war or elsewhere. [for more on Sun Tzu - see here: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu#The_Art_of_War What raises the question – HOW was this book adopted by Japanese business circles in the 1970s and later by Chinese business culture? (yes, in that order). The answer is that the book DOES give several tips that – IN SPIRIT – apply to negotiations. For instance he discusses the importance of preliminary preparation before going out to battle (remember, he's talking about making sure the soldiers' weapons are intact). Does that apply to negotiations? – Absolutely YES; no doubt that a negotiator should be well prepared. But should he consider it a battle? Well, if you have done any negotiating with the Chinese or Japanese in the 90s, as I have, they possibly used to think that way, but today I feel that the climate has changed. Or let's take another pearl from the book: "Great warlords first win the battle, only then go out to combat". One would have to agree on that approach as well. But if you are a salesman, who just heard his customer say that "they need a 30% discount in order to even BEGIN negotiations on the deal" – how exactly is Tzu's insight helpful? To summarize, The Art of War is a great book for military strategy and tactics – as in West Point material. In modern business, however, I believe that seeing a negotiation as a combat or war will only cause loss of deals. The Chinese and Japanese are STILL skillful and tenacious negotiators, but their new generation of negotiators are more western oriented and probably never read this book. I could have passes myself.	0
Great read! you can actually learn a few things. I would recommend this book to anyone. it's a very well known book.	1
This is indeed a great book, then the ancient Chinese might not fully know what to do in warfare. But now this book as well as too many other books tells us only what to do, does not tell us how to do. The issue of how to do is perhaps the most difficult point in any activity.	1
A must!	1
Great read!!	1
The Giles translation of Sun Tzu's classic is available for the Kindle as a free download. Click here:   This is the Gutenberg Project public-domain text, which these other publishers have uploaded at prices ranging from $1 to $7. Save your money!	1
I agree that the translation can be a bit clumsy in places but if you overlook that you can fiind some real gems inside this unusual little book. I love the relevance of so many of the concepts and every time I flick through I find a new lesson or a new way to apply the same lessons in a different context. "Only fight your battles after the victory has been won." Loving' it.	1
It's OK.	1
Awesome advice on everyday life. Second best book after the Bible.  Especially good at applying to work and love.	1
There is a reason this book has survived for centuries. One of the best strategy books ever written.	1
Love it	1
The moment that I began to read this book I, began to realize how applicable it was to everything, from war to business, to relationships. War is in everything that we do, and Sun Tzu describes perfectly how to win every battle, even when you are outnumbered, and outmatched.	1
A great read no matter if your military or not. More a look into ones self and their capabilities. Great book enjoyed reading it.	1
seems as this book lacks any logical order and as such offers nothing but a fuzzy,messy, unreadble collection of words. the introduction is 1/4 of the book an is a compliment to be called an introduction.	0
Everyone should read this book.	1
Sun Tzu is poetic in his description of war tactics. It is interesting that his tactics developed centuries  ago are applicable and relevant today. "Hence, an enlightened ruler is needful and a good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact."	1
The art of war is overrated. You can find a free pdf online, but it's not worth a read, though it is worth a skim through. I you really want a book worth reading, then read a book by Robert Greene. Robert Greene is a great nonfiction author and makes history interesting by deriving from it the best behaviors to achieve specific objects, whether they be seduction, power, warfare, or mastery.	0
book was in great condition when it arrived to my home. Love the book. easy buy.	1
THIS BOOK IS FULL OF GOOD ADVICE ON WAR AND DEFENSE..	1
Every military leader should read this book and refer to it frequently. You will be able to see clearly the cause of many of our military disasters...... and victories.	1
Our political leaders need to read it	1
I would have to say this book makes one of my top ten list as the best books of all time.	1
This is a book of strategy for psychological warfare--it helps you tackle the battles you face every day. One of the biggest themes is how to win a fight *before* it actually starts. If only our current government and military leaders had followed the wisdom of "The Art of War"...	1
Good	1
very interesting and now it makes it more clear the winners from the losers	1
GREAT PRODUCT!	1
I feel ripped off the book is like 70 pages long.  I could read that in an hour.  That really isn't even fair to classify this as a book.  A real book you don't even get into it until after 70 pages	0
looking for demonstrations of the war doctrine not statues	0
This book is a classic!  I bought and read this book out of curiosity.  It seems to me some of our recent contemporary U.S. "commanders" should have read this book before starting the Iraq war and taken its advise. This book is filled with strategy regarding conflict.  Some of the content is obviously way outdated.	1
The Art of War seems to be a classic piece of Chinese philosophy that is easy to translate into a mediocre work.  I've read a number of translations of Sun Tzu that are clunky and have none of the wit of the original text.  Now, I don't read ancient Chinese, but when a Chinese philisophical text reads like a manual for a microwave, you know something is lost in translation. On the other hand, this translation, done by Thomas Cleary, showed me the subtlety in the Art of War.  In addition to the work itself (which would make a very thin book) there is a long, interesting introduction written by the translator which I found very helpful in thinking about the Art of War, as well as helping to put the work in both a historical context, and the context amongst many of the other ancient Chinese philisophical works.  How Sun Tzu's work relates to Taoism is very interesting.  Also, there are selected commentation on each of the paragraphs of the Art of War.  These commentaries were written over different periods of time by different Chinese philosophers.  These help to show how many different points of view can exist over a single statement made by Sun Tzu. I find this translation very well done, and I can easily recommend it to anyone who wants to read The Art of War.	1
Silly	1
A must read for everyone...	1
Absolute classic, but here's the thing--its not really all that relevant to today's time.  A lot of people try to turn its stories into metaphors, but it seems to do its historical context a disservice.	1
 This is a magnificent book that tells as much about psychology as it does military strategy.	1
Great learning about other cultures are you a lion or a fox?	1
There was nothing extraordinary about the logic, strategies and tactics he has mentioned in the book.  I would say it is a good compilation of standard practices.	0
So this is the great book everyone loves? It's not even a book really, Just a bunch of like sayings or quotations. Don't attack an army if there are more of them then there are of you. Gee thanks! Don't waste your time it's way overrated.	0
A classic	1
Received it in a timely and efficient manner.	1
This will go down as one of the all time great works by the human race. Excellent insight to the tactics in war and life. This needs to be a mandatory reed for kids in high school.	1
Good book	1
Most people don't seem to understand this book at all, think it is some self help book, this is not the case. It is about war.	1
This book is required reading for anyone interested in military history. It's very short, but to the point.  It paints the profile of a "Godlike" commander.  I've read it several times already.  Good read.	1
Insightful	1
Exciting, always wanted a copy.	1
The content of the translations themselves was fine, but I found the formatting difficult to read. The translator also interjects thoughts into the middle of sentences which disrupted the flow of the text even further. Other versions may be fascinating, but I found this one stale and unremarkable.	0
To understand the motivations of politicians and corporate gamesmanship, read this book.	1
Soft cover book, nice	1
good condition;as advertised	1
I have enjoyed the book.  It has interesting ideas and concepts that I would have not understood about the warrior mind.  It was helpful for my own research.  I find it interesting that a current reality show uses this text for its show members.	1
I expected a full length book, but a pamper with quotes	1
only one cd worked. The other worked fine so I'll have to give it 3 stars on a count that there are no half stars.	1
Great product!	1
Excellent, one of the best in the market for strategic thinking.	1
This is a magnificent book that tells as much about psychology as it does military strategy.	1
This is not the full works of Sun Tzu, but an outline version.  Kind of like cliffnotes.  However, the book isn't bad for a quick read to get the basic idea of Sun Tzu's writings.	0
One of those books everyone who works in a competitive environment needs to read. You can apply the teachings of war to circumstances in the work place	1
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is an excellent book especially for those people who are in the military or law enforcement.  The language of the book refers to ancient and not modern times.  Based on my readings the author seems to be an aggressor, since in modern times we strive for peace and not war-like in the ancient times.	1
The Chinese had warfare figured out 3000 years ago. War has not changed enough since then to make this work irrelevant.	1
Written by a military strategist in ancient China, this book has become the bible of different military officers in the world. the dictum of Sun Tzu, which is to know your enemy, won many wars.	1
This book is great. If you have a enemy you want to take down or a solider about to go to battle, this is the book for you. It tells you everything you need to know about how to win.	1
The Basics	1
The books construct bored me. However it does have insightful information	1
GOOD book, INSPIRING, MIND GAMES, I LOVED IT.	1
Great	1
Great book. Great information!	1
One of the greatest books on strategy ever written. Need I say more?	1
Exactly what I wanted!	1
Fortunately, I only tried the sample on my Kindle. Would have been a 100% loss since the text seems to be hardly edited and incomplete. The layout on the Kindle is terrible. Dont't buy this. Shame on Amazon for trying to sell such a flawed product! I'd rather go for a free and complete edition by Project Gutenberg. Or look for a different edition.	0
Very interesting	1
The book is very interesting but I thought the translator's introduction was too long (more than a quarter of the whole book).	1
not the same as the original	0
I don't know why did I buy this instead of geting a free, better version. Don't make the same mistake.	0
My only complaint is that commentaries are interspersed within the text; a bit disruptive.  However it is free and I'm glad to have it in my collection.	1
I've looked at 3 different versions of this book, trying to find the best... Or at least the one with the best reviews but they all have the same reviews. Word for word the same damn reviews. Is this just people with too much time on their hands? Could someone please leave a helpful review that hasnt been posted on every other version of the art of war, I seriously doubt anyone read every single version.... WTF PEOPLE.	1
Timeless cl.assic, but no need to get a new one	1
Just google "the art of war" and you get the full text of the translation by Giles - it's in public domain.	0
Great read. It was very informative.	1
The Art of War is timeless information. The rules are a plus in business and personal outlook. I recommend it.	1
Came in great time Russell Simmons has me thinking Vegan already only 1 chapter in I also watched his interviews about this book on YouTube before buying very intriguing	1
Do not buy this edition. This was a waste of time and money	0
The greatest chinese strategist immortalized his ideas in this book about war strategies and tactics. amazing books !	1
The book was in great shape, just like new. Product was received in a timely fashion. I am very pleased with the service i received. Great job! Kristin	1
Misspellings, incorrect chapter order, and apparently not full original text. Don't know how Amazon allows this	0
New book	1
Make love not war.	1
Excellent book.. !! Check out this ebook:  Success through Poetry	1
I'm sure this is a good book, but it is nearly impossible to read the Kindle edition I bought. No spacing between the words	0
Not very interesting. I did not like it. Sunzi did a bad job writing this book. Not made for kids or adults. I hate it.	0
Not what I needed, but delivered promptly.	1
Was a gift. Came in good time>	1
The Art of War has been the best book I have ever had the privilige of reading.	1
The book was very interesting. It really made look at issues in a totally different light. I love this book.	1
This is a good reference guide for the teachings of Sun Tzu. Straight and to the point.	1
This edition was published by Filiquarian Publishers and from a publishing perspective, this book appears to have been designed in a basic Word processing program. Shoddy, shoddy, work. Lacks creative design, weak choice of fonts, inconsistent spacing, erroneous punctuation symbols, etc. Additionally, one of the chapters was out of order. I'm speculating that the publisher didn't know how to read roman numerals and therefore placed the chapter incorrectly, and if they did, and there was a purpose for this, it should have been addressed in the non-existent introduction. The content of the book is fine, just buy an edition by a an established publisher rather than someone working from their basement.	0
I ordered my normal size and probably couldn't have worn it if I lost 30 lbs.!	0
This book shows how some (sexist) men really think--even today.  Let's have women's equality now . . . everywhere. No wonder we have had centuries of wars. War is not the only solution, but it is all too often the knee-jerk reaction of a sexist society with like-minded male leaders in charge. Even though this book represents thinking from long ago, it still reflects the sexist, combative male psyche and primal need to dominate rather than cooperate which is still fostered and rewarded in business today. It explains why women do not get ahead in business after countless years and many decades of demonstrated ability and superior management skills.  The master's house will not be destroyed with the master's tools. This book is a sad reflection on life.	0
why is this not avaliable in the asia pacific region!??? I mean come on, its hundreds of years old and in the public domain, why cant i get the kindle edition?	0
Sun Tzu's the art of war is one of the most overrated books in terms of content. It is not that the writer is wrong about most subjects (though a lot is hopelessly outdated). The problem is that any 12 year old who has played with toy soldiers enough, could have written this book, without the fancy words or synonyms. Don't attack when outnumbered, with the sun in your face etc etc. The very basics of battles, not even of warfare. True warfare, now and then, relies more on logistics with the battles being just a small part of war. So if you are completely ignorant of battles and war and simple logic you can read this book and be satisfied. However if you are truely interested in the "art of war" then read the book with that same name from Machiavelli.	0
Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Great price.	1
Not just about "war", but rather every challenging aspect of your life.	1
Nice	1
Great book and strategies that can not only help you in war but in life.	1
This is not the original writing. Someone's notes sold as real. The cons of amazon ratings	0
Great	1
As described	1
AOK	1
Awesome book!	1
A Total Must Read, The Art Of War,Good Buy At A Good Price.	1
This is actually a poorly produced pamphlet, some twenty odd pages - unfortunately the advertisement does not state this fact	0
Please note...this is not the full version of the book but a very heavily abridged version of approximately 50 pages in very large print. To read from cover to cover takes about 10 minutes. The seller does not make this clear. In my opinion, this book is an absolute rip off.	0
The Art of War (the book itself needs no further presentation by now) as a beautiful example of "the art of printing". Very happy with the hardcover, pocket-size edition, by Arcturus Publishing Limited.	1
Of course that is a classic. I have to say that I feel a little uncomfortable with the concept of always thinking about winning the battle. I can appreciate the benefits of mastering those principles for anyone engaging in battles (politics, economics, socials...) but unless it is the last option, I prefer to engage with others thinking win-win. I will certainly read that book a few more times this year and in the years to come. As a classic, it is worth reading it, as for its daily use, I guess it is needed to read it over and over so it gets easier to really understand the principles and understand how to apply them correctly in our everyday life.	1
I didn't notice this was the "chump change edition" aka the abridged version. I got it in hardcover as well. Can you imagine a hardcover pamphlet? 20-30 pages. It's quite funny. Not a total wast of money, but not what I was expecting as this information in not apparent in the item description.	0
The kindle version has some formatting issues but forget about that. The key here is that the rules of war are set very well. In essence, war is about strength and strength comes in many forms, not just numbers. The book explains how to measure strength and this applies to your enemy as well as yourself. If you are strong, pretend to be weak. If you are weak, pretend to be strong. As a rule, nobody attacks a foe whose strength is unknown so if you remain a mystery to your enemy, they are unlikely to attack. Such an interesting read with great examples from history. Recommended reading.	1
The Art of War is the surprisingly succinct classic of military literature attributed to Sun Tzu. No one knows exactly when The Art of War was written but it was collected around the 10th Century CE. Regardless of your interest in military strategy, this short collection of proverbs and idioms is worth the time it takes to read. The lessons can be broad and universally applied to daily life, especially in business and career terms.	1
this book was great. i am currently using some tactics learnt from within the book against a brand named pro rep. they have a product which i would rather have received a bag of cow feces. cow feces doesn’t give cancer to children.	1
I love this book. If you read it less from a military tactician perspective and more an evaluation of life, it somehow seems to make more sense to me at least.	1
This classic book has been renowned for centuries, but it doesn't get old. The advice it contains is wise and can be applied to modern-day life including the workplace. It is not just a book about war and warfare, but about an approach to life. The translation is well done.	1
Amazing product, The quality is Brilliant and i will definitely recommend this to my family and friends to enjoy, i cannot recommend this highly enough, this is a must have! Excellent seller with fast delivery time and also great customer service.	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this read. The book made me think a lot more than I expected. It is a good read for one sitting or over a few. I would highly recommend the read to all and I am certain you will enjoy your time with this book.	1
Interesting ideas.  I hope to implement some of them in our cricket league next year,	1
This is a classic that I have wanted to read for a while. It was different than I had expected but in a good way, in that it advocates diplomacy over conflict any day. Very interesting indeed.	1
Got the B&N Leatherbound pocket edition of this book, the book is presented beautifully and feels very well made unlike some other B&N Leatherbound editions, this one feels far more substantial and the leather a bit thicker. Sewn pages and thick binding make this feel great in the hands. This edition is definitely my favourite choice of the Art of War	1
This edition is for children I guess.  It's a reprint and the entire importance and it being an ancient manuscript is lost with its font and general print ..should always recheck the edition before purchasing	0
The formatting for this Kindle version is terrible and the academic narrative jumps from one thread to another, without much explanation of the scholars, characters and time frames involved. It really did not provide me with what I was after: a clearly contextualized narrative of The Art of War. Thankfully this purchase was cheap.	0
In case you're expecting a thick tome, or a novel: it's basically a super-thin, super-simple pamphlet guide. That being said, it's riveting. Each "lesson" makes you stop and think, and while I'm not a very philosophical or meditative person, I found myself musing on the various rules of war, and how they apply to my personal and professional life. A bargain buy!	1
I take this into everyday living, it does make you think from a different perspective.	1
Just as expected and well packed. Arrived three days later than predicted but it is Black Friday week so not surprised. Interesting treatise on strategy of war.	1
Very interesting as to the mind of someone who seeks every possibility and prepares for every eventuality when war may ensue	1
I bought this expecting some large thickness paper back, but it's only 6mm or so thick with a typeface more akin to infant school readers!	1
Brought for a  friend	1
Having heard about this work many times getting a copy has pleased me a lot you will understand that the work needs interpreing to your situation and this can be sales/ management/ planning ........ All the way to child care and relationships  people haven't changed that much reading through you will find your boss ___ mates ------- partner ------ they are all there and laid bare possibly even you  can't recommend highly enough	1
As headline describes, this is a very brief book compared to the original one.. should be specified better in description as the text in description box references 13 chapters quite alot for a 30 page book. I sent it back to get the full translated version	0
Short version of the book but worth the money	1
It's very interesting the way both the psychological and strategical methodologies are outlined in this book. It really is a good read.	1
This is the second time I have read this book and still find it fascinating. It is concise, split into easy to read sections and although it was intended to provide strategies for success in battle there are people management techniques that apply today.	1
One of those books you just have to read to say you have. However it is a very difficult read. Not for the faint of heart.	1
A classic that everyone should read.	1
A book written by a legend, this might teach you a thing or two if you're into total war games	1
Great book, a must have classics if your life goals are world domination. This book set the base for modern EQ theories	1
Interesting book, but it does state the obvious. Impressed that this was written so long ago and still have value.	1
An interesting read even if I will not use it in my life that much. A classic that must be read	1
Downloads well	1
definitely helpful for writing!! can see myself referencing this a lot in future with some of my WIPs	1
Really nice colours and book that we all no and loce	1
Very informative book, can be applied to many current day(non war) situations. Some very basic spelling, grammar errors which need correcting.	1
Know your enemy, know yourself and you shall be victorious. Good book to read, better book to reflect on.	1
Great	0
I read this as a modern-day analogy for business conduct and to see what all the buzz was about. First of all, it is extremely short- you will polish it off in a single sitting for sure. Secondly, I can see how some people suggest this for modern times, however I personally would not. The book is too focused on actual battle and very high level tactics. It would seem that many of the other similar but more targeted books in this category would do a better job for what I was looking for.	0
It is worth a read. Principles can probably be applied to other areas of life.	1
It’s a pamphlet!	1
It’s a must read a classic	1
Very thin reading. Holiday stuff.	1
Very good with good explanatory notes by the compiler.	1
Individual taste but enticing for people who love control	1
Good	1
Good book. Wise words. Quick reading and a lot to meditate on. Translation is clear enough for the average person.	1
If you'd like to gain some more insight into this famous book buy this. It's a little straight forward more like bullet points than an instructive book. worth the price.	1
A brilliant book, well worth reading. Ranks alongside 'I Ching' and Machiavelli's  'The Prince'. As a book all entrepreneurs need to read.	1
Simple structured book	1
It makes you wonder how people lose war's when there is a manual on how to do it right like this. It's not like it's big to carry round or difficult to understand. It just show's how thick warmonger's are.	1
A+	1
One of these books you should read. It is quoted in dozens of TV programmes and novelsm from Star Trek to the sopranos!	1
I didn't manage to finish all of it. A friend rex reading it. It's an interesting read but I feel I had to be in the right frame of mind to digest it	1
Inspiring read filled with lots of strategic advice.	1
Great delievery	1
Great book and good read	1
It might just help you in your day to day life to win your own wars in which we all fight each day. The translation is loose but your mind gets used to it 71K3 R3AD1NG numbers and letters together. You get to grips with it.	1
A classic book i wanted to read, although not a great read, more like a list of observations I am  glad i read it, different!	1
Good Read	1
Good	1
Everyone should read this, if only for the wisdom imparted for life.  Readers should not contemplate war on reading this (easy to read, user friendly) manual.	1
Haven’t read it yet so why bothering me about review when I didn’t even finish the first chapter? Should be prompted in the middle not here.	1
Excellent !	1
An Ancient book on the dynamics of war, understandably dated but also timeless in principal. If you like the title you will like the read.	1
This is one of those classics that is a must have for a bookcase. Its not as long as I thought but it does make you think!	1
This book is very easy to quote and has lessons that extend much father than the world of conflict. This is a must read for everyone.	1
Wonderful classic to have in my possession.	1
Quite brief, not really what I expected.	1
good	1
Somewhat philosophical in places but an invaluable insight into the Chinese mind.  Very interesting once you get through the heavy bits.	1
Classical text well explained	1
Fascinating to read. I am still enjoying every bit of it. Perfect Kindle read. I would recommend this to anyone.	1
Not read this book yet but I like the picture on the front of the book. Worth buying for that reason alone	1
As good as new. Very good quality. The translation is very good. I liked it	1
totally worthwhile read just for the philosophy. still valid today, maybe not for war, but how to deal with work etc	1
Fantastic book.	1
A classic, of course, and rightly so. Easy to read, but it takes time to digest properly.	1
It is a short book written by a successful Chinese general from thousands of years ago; I finished it in just one day. Even with its terse content, it is hard to summarize in a short blog post due to its diverse structure. Each of its chapters provides bullet-point lists of military-grade advice—good advice no doubt, but not the stuff from which movie scripts are drawn.	1
Worth a read to show that strategy and tactics have not changed too much over the centuries	1
Exactly what it's supposed to be	1
awesome book	1
Love this book, it's a must read. Definitely up there with the 100 books to read before you die	1
An old classic.. great seller.. timely delivery, smooth transaction..recommend seller	1
Poorly printed and badly outlined. I love the book and was hoping for a beautiful hard cover, but was left disappointed, unfortunately...	0
Great book, can be applied to life's experience in a multitude of different ways. Thoroughly recommend.	1
Good read. I'm not really someone that makes war and this was useful for me as well. I found the chapter on laying plans particularly good	1
a good book broken down into good sized chapter for some great light reading. it is good for those small journeys	1
Interesting to look at the knowledge and tactics used at such an early moment in history. Worth reading if you're interested in early Chinese history.	1
Very easy to read and thought provoking when dealing with politics within your business or personal life. I have really enjoyed reading this book.	1
Loved it	1
Interesting insight into military tactics	1
good	1
son liked it a lot :D	1
Nice book to read and also a cool addition to your library.	1
I enjoyed reading this book. As an introduction into the Art of War it is brilliant. I spent a lot of time reflecting on my own experiences whilst reading this.	1
as described good read	1

Very Good book bought it just because it's recomended for life!	1

Love it	1
Great product, 8/8 would buy again.	1
Very Interesting. However didn't realise that the book was full of very short ideas and comments. Nevertheless can see why this would be popular for those in need of strategic ideas.	1
Love this book.	1
A most definite read.	1
good book about life in general	1
have only read bits of it so far.	1
Well packaged Great Edition of the Art Of War	1
I always love this book. there is nothing to doubt about the content. absolutely almost the same like the hardcover version like i used to hve	1
Sun Tzu still reads well, even thought it is older than the Bible. Worth a read for any budding capitalist	1
Not very exciting.	1
very interesting book	1
inspiring	1
good	1
I can see why this has been such a stalwart of military strategy for so long. Insightful and clever. Loved it	1
Very informative book for military colleges and officer training schools explains how to become a military leader I recommend the book if you are curious about military runs.	1
Excellent Product & Delivery	1
Have had a previous version and wanted to read it again. Very applicable methodologies and techniques for the current business world.	1
Excellent 5/5	1
A good piece of classic literature that considering when it was written is still surprisingly relevant. A few mistakes have been made in this translation nothing huge though.	1
It's a classic I've read many times before and a free download just can't turn down.	1
Reasonable price and fast delivery. A very good read.	1
If your a team leader and want to know how to lead your team read this book. Somethings never change	1
I had heard about this book in particular for a long time and had it recommended so I finally got myself a copy and I think it is a great book, excellent read. Very happy.	1
Awesome book	1
Thanks all good and a great read whichever iteration you pick up	1
Gave it as a gift and they were absolutely thrilled. great service can't fault it	1
It is not advertised that this is a condensed version of the book.	0
Ever been screwed over? read this one and you will see it before it comes. It therefore will not happen again.	1
Not the actual book. Do not buy.	0
Its a classic & a must have! Great Read!	1
This is a faithful adaptation of The Art Of War; very readable and incredibly relevant even now. This is one of those books everyone should read.	1
Classic	1
Thia book is very educational and made easy as there is an explanation for every extract of the art of war however if you know the meaning you can continue to read in bold	1
This book has taught me so much, about life, work. You can translate it all into success in business. Excellently written and full to the brim of amazing references. One I shall definitely keep revisiting.	1
Quality of book not as good, seems like there's alot missing.	1
was okay.	1
New one.	1
intersting	1
A lot of it seems obvious, but it's a great tool. Very well laid out, easy to read, recommended for any body keen on deepening their understanding of basic principles.	1
Love it!	1
Good read in the main. Liked it to dip in and out of randomly between other books. Plenty to make you think	1
The printed MRP is ₹99 and I got it at ₹69. Delivery from Amazon was as usual good. Now talking about the book I think it's the most overated book that I have read so far.  So my suggestion would be not to waste time on this. It is written point wise that also for me seems a little childish. It talks about different tactics of warfare which is completely irrelevant in today's time. One atom bomb and all your Art of War would go in vain. I though of giving it 2 stars but the reviews that is there on the cover of the book is so very good that it made me give it 1 star. Also comparing it with Gita is complete insult to human civilization. Rest I would say if you have a lot of time and want to waste it and get angry after few days then I would suggest you to go for this.	0
10/10	1
Very good	1
Brilliant insight into war strategy and the mind of a war strategist.	1
Nice one	1
interesting, but hard to context (for me)	0
Good book with some great ideas	1
A great read, deserving of its acclaim. A must read for the contemporary master. An echo of the past resonating true to the modern application of force and subterfuge.	1
Good	1
I know feel that I posess the tactical knowledge and the logistics of warfare to help me conquer my neighbouring province. Heil Sun Tzu!	1
exactly what I was expecting a book to make you think	1
very good	1
Out of all the books involving philosophy this is the most interesting one.	1
Great translation. Great book.	1
I was expecting as indicated in the free mini-after purchase version of the book, a conversion of the tales and events of Sun Tzu and his tact. But was highly disappointd to see that this was nothing more than a bland version of "do this. Do that in a war scene". Timely delivered. Timely returned. Don't understand why it has such high ratings.	0
It's the 2nd Gita/ Quran / Bible/ Granth Sahib (whatever is yours)! And if you want to be successful in any field then this book will fire up your mind. But let me tell you one thing...... It's a book that basically gives you instructions, instructions on how to fight a war and win. It's not that kind of book that makes every instruction simpler by explaining it with a lot of examples (It makes sense when you consider the fact that it was written by Sun Tzu thousands of years ago). It's just the instructions...... That's it. So you may find it a little difficult to relate it to circumstances in your life. So while reading the book, power on your creative mind and try relating each instruction to your everyday use. I bet it's going to be a brainstorming session and what's more..... You'll love it!!	1
Must read for business folks !	1
Know thine enemy...	1
Like it	1
Great	1
When you start reading it it looks brilliant. It appears Sun Tzu was brilliant strategist. But these idiotic mental war fare and win a war without actually fighting it, just makes an army lazy. This book is the reason for China losing almost every war after SUN TZU era...lost from Mongols... Europe divided China as a Mellon. And lost from Japanese, Russians, Americans, Vietnamese and more to come if they do not destroy this book.	0
Book looks and feels cheap but the translation is very good! The choice of words is precise yet predictable and is neither archaic nor new age. Each passage is translated in such a way to make the message directly accessible in English. There are no footnotes (which is something I wanted) but there is a very good and lengthy introduction.	1
Received the book in bad condition. The front cover was crampled and there were dents over the cover and sides as well. Quality was not adequate. Moreover the book original price was INR 150 and not INR 630 as claimed. This the discounts stated was also not correct.	0
So i read this book a number of times before i finally began to decode it, and well safe to say its full of gems. I'm not a very manipulative person by nature but have had many run ins over my short life span with people of this nature, which has very much contributed to myself being trod all over. Reading this book really put into perspective many aspects of human behaviour and well quite frankly highlighted the characteristics of a narcissist and potential methods to counteract it. There are many scenarios in the book which I don't see myself using however being new to the business world, i definitely know that i will be revisiting the book numerous times. To put it simply, take this book with a grain of salt and interpret it as you wish but regardless of the extent to which you relate to it - simply learning of the true essence of war makes it an interesting read nonetheless! Also regarding the product - it is quite thin and condensed, i wish there was more room to annotate it as i was cramming sentences between lines by the end of it, and a book of this sort definitely needs annotation 😅 but it did arrive fast and as pictured! a steal for the price!	1
Well book	1
The book is very short, concise and one seating read which can at max take 4-5 hours. Insights are good but somehow translation seems off the target. If you are familiar with war terminology and scenarios then definitely go for this book but if it's your first book in the domain of strategy building and decision making then go for the book with explanation of each tactic given in simple language and analogy, many of these books are available on Amazon itself.	1
You may be wondering why I have picked such a title for this review, and there is a very good reason for it.  Written well over a thousand years ago Sun Tzu's tactical guide to war is still used and taught in military schools, and has found more applications over the centuries. The tactics laid out here were used in historical battles fought in Asia and China but they were also used by Ninja's and intelligence services.  Nowadays still used by the military and intelligence worlds they have found a place in business.  Why this is so is firstly because it isn't long to read, it isn't hard to read, and it is reliable information.  If you use a bit of thought then you can apply the teachings of Sun Tzu in your life, as and when necessary.  Of course although being short this does make you use your brain and think, and this in itself can make you come up with ideas how to apply the teachings here.  This is a must read for those who study  military tactics, and military history, as well as businessmen, and those who want to be one step ahead of the game.  Ultimately this is the classic for all, and hopefully can help you in unforeseen ways, and in many situations.	1
El libro son parrafos sueltos sin ningun tipo de analisis añadido y no demasiado bien estructurados. Como si alguien hubiera juntado los apuntes en un panfleto tipo chuleta la noche antes de un examen. Bastante pauperrimo, aunque el precio esté bien, yo no lo recomendaria.	0
Nice book for leadership, strategy & knowledge but little disappointed with book size & just summary of points no explanation.	1
The book is great and there are some amazing tactics that can be used in our everyday modern life. However, few points are very contradicting to the actual meaning in the book. It's a must read book but not worth the hype people have created. 3 stars because of multiple contradictory sentences (maybe the actual meaning could be lost in the translation). Thanks to Amazon and the seller for quick delivery and reasonable pricing.	1
This is probably one of the best versions of the Art of War i've seen anyway. It basically gives some analysis and goes into depth on what Sun Tzu means, using some ancient Chinese commentators as references and examples to better explain the teachings. I would have given this 5 stars but it's layed out strangely. You'll find pages with 1 sentence that seem continue on the next page, but it's tolerable given the depth which the researcher explains things. I have 3 different versions of the Art of War. One is a thin 50 page pamphlet, the second has some artwork included but this version includes more than just Sun Tzu's teachings on certain topics. As a result it's more enjoyable to read than a list of bullet-points, and much more informative.	1
Die Geschichten in dem Buch kann man gut auf Alltagssituationen überleiten und gut in das täglich Leben einbauen, so dass man eine Strategie entwickeln kann. Das Buch hilft einem dazu sehr.	1
I would like to thank Sun Tzu for giving the world a masterpiece to apply techniques that will give you success to achieve higher purpose in life. Though this book is about war strategies Sun Tzu mentions war is not good for nation at large and we need to find out way to win without a fight. Should we apply that to our lives we are mostly bogged down by little things that upsets us unnecessarily all we need to do is move ahead and move inch close to our vision each day.	1
The book has been written in a clear and easy to understand bullet points format. Each statement carries a weight to it and needs to be thought over before proceeding. Highly recommended to those who are involved in any kind of competition, conflict resolution  or to people in public administration. Definitely a classic!	1
A great book but I thought initially about it would be a self help book but could not get to the point as expected but one can relate the points mentioned in the book with one's life when he or she tries to see life or simply challenges of life as just enemy otherwise the book is mainly focused on war stuffs like that of army and all..	1
The kindle version of this book is absolutely unreadable. So many OCR errors, I can’t even come close to getting in to a flow (counted 10 or so on a single page). Even if free, this is inexcusable, at least run it through a spell check....	0
Really great book. Good book to learn about Strategy. Simple and quick to read. Strategies are written point wise, so it is easy to read and learn. All the necessary strategies which are required to know, are in this book. Like the Newsweek quote-" Absorb this book, you can throw out all those contemporary books about management leadership " Book was a excellent condition.  Brand new.	1
Very glad I purchased this book. It's actually 6 books in one. Very good condition and a very attractive book. One of my faves and a important book to have in your library. Not only does it contain ,"The Art of War", but it also has the," Tao Te Ch'ing".	1
Das Buch ist von historischem Wert und Inhalt. Die beschriebenen Empfehlungen sind auch heute noch von Relevanz zur Unternehmensführung (entweder als gutes oder schlechtes Beispiel) und dienen auch um chinesische Philosophien und Denkweisen zu verstehen. Allerdings ist die Formatierung und Übersetzung ausgesprochen schlecht: Seitenzahlen fehlen, ebenso fehlt ein Inhalts- oder Stichwortverzeichnis. Es ist unklar wo übersetzt wird und wo Kommentare oder andere Zitate eingefügt wurden. Die Kapitelüberschriften lassen sich kaum vom Fließtext unterscheiden.	0
This book is of no use. It is just a summary or headlines of the actual book. serves no purpose to the reader	0
Excellent read. I got to know about this book from the infamous movie 'Wall Street" starring Michael Douglas as a charismatic business leader in which he quotes Sun Tzu-" Every battle is won even before it is fought". A definite on must reads	1
Everyone should read this book once in their life. Many lessons learned.	1
I thought the book would be about how to win wars, giving example from past and how to improve, but it is step by step guide about preparation of war. Not what I expected.	1
This book by sun tzu teaches a lot about ancient warfare and is quiet interesting. But it not only tells about that, it tells how to understand and control the actions of other. The way to influence them and to use advantages efficiently. It is a fun short book with a little bit of history and philosophy.	1
Print is proper and readable, easy on eyes. Almost error free too so if you want to read this book can go for this print version.	1
Pas d'introduction de général de l'armée US de la seconde guerre mondiale ou plus récent dont j'ai rien à faire et qui n'a aucun rapport avec Sun Tzu, pas de préface jonchée de poncifs marketing enrobés de superlatifs ronflants, juste le texte d'origine traduit avec des polices de caractères très lisibles et très agréables à la lecture. Tout ce que j'apprécie, ne changez rien, parfait !	1
Contains summarized quotations. Go for book that contain the context also	1
The work of Sun Tzu needs no endorsement - it is a timeless classic.  This print itself is quite good.  Its a small pocketbook with good paper and good printing.  Priced very reasonably, worth the buy	1
A bit dated. I bought this based on many reviews which said that its still relevant today. I am not sure if I picked up the wrong translation! but there are not many words of wisdom that I found which is applicable today.	1
May be this books is amazing for people who are in defence services but i wasn't able to connect to it. This book has war lessons in form of quotes and reading them feels like there is no link to those quotes and your life	0
This book is still the demograph for all armies today the fascinating ideal however is its use in day to day life the use of mentalism and not only knowing your enemy but also weighing up daily trials...	1
The book contains Only tips and instructions. You have to use your mind to understand it in modern context with your examples. You need to think. The quality of pages was good but the page color is yellow. I bought the fingerprints publishing version.	1
I just had to have this book, especially at this low price.  I couldn't go wrong.  Very interesting. Very compact and complete.  A book used through the ages.  Most insightful.	1
Non solo un trattato di arte militare. questo è un libro di strategie applicabili in senso esteso a tutte le situazioni della vita ed è anche un'ottima lettura.	1
Even though this timeless piece is a dedicated guidebook to waging war, a lot of the verses can be applicable in every day life.  Really, it's a book of strategy, and understanding human nature.  A great short read	1
Very happy, it was delivered in the afternoon with a very professional service,book is awesome	1
This pocket book is great for a quick read. The entire book is in the form of notes with bitesize pieces of information. Quite an easy read.	1
It looks like a cheap knock off of the art of war. Translation is sub-par, organisation of topics is also poor. It feels boring to read and kills the interest of reader very quick. Go for some other publication.	0
San Tzu is really a genius who knows who's who of the war. The art of war is a bundle of knowledge which is necessary in the contemporary world. It is not only meant to deal a war but to deal with your day to day situations. You will find an opportunity in every crisis after reading this book.	1
This is a very good book. It's recommended for reading in military academies all over the world. But 2000 years after it was written, the book is more philosophy than military tactics. Reading it will motivate you and increase your morale. So, give it a try.	1
Un genio assoluto per l'epoca in cui scriveva! Un must per chiunque voglia ottenere qualcosa nella vita.	1
This book is not subjective it's in bullet points but gives the whole crux of the book Recommended for not so bibliophiles!!	1
Bo idea why this is so well rated... thats like a pamphlet nothing more. don't waste your time!	0
Art of war In the war which kind of action u have to take How to deal with another soldier of another team	1
it is a small book with great deal of knowledge. if one can absorb the content well then he/she can easily surpass knowledge of present leadership books inmarket.	1
Cant access in ebook. Lost this in cyberspace/cloud. Cant appreciate the book.	0
It’s simplicity because of points make it very interesting read	1
Dieses Buch ist sogar recht unterhaltsam geschreiben und hat einen hohen psychischen Anspruch, wenn man wirklich versucht die Argumente des Autors zu reflektieren.	1
Written 500 B.C., read by many historical figure. This book helped solved more conflicts in history than weapons. Everyone should read it to learn how to think and resolve conflicts of all magnitudes	1
This book is one of the real classic old time book. which invokes the reader attention especially if one is interested in military.	1
The content is great but the quality of paper could've been better.	1
An absolutely wonderful insight with a age defying knowledge. A must read for people from all walks of professional life	1
It doesn't even cost that much. You can finish it within one hour. So, what are you waiting for?	1
A most excellent gift for the interested son.	1
I should have read the reviews first before buying. It is only 29 pages, a basic summary of points and rules. Too bad, I always wanted to read this (full book obviously).	0
With all due respect to the great author, English interpretation not up to the mark. Not worth a read.	0
Very disappointing for the price.  The book is A5 and the cover is not the quality described.  For $75 I expected something of higher quality ... not a notebook equivalent.	0
the timeless masterpiece of work and mind power to achieve success and a higher level of peace of mind. this book is based on old strategies and methodologies which are timeless and can be implemented in present and future aswell. highly recommended reading this. SUN TZU  you genius warrior!	1
awesome book! quality pages!	1
THIS BOOK IS SHEISTY, 27 PAGES OF PURE FINESSE. BUY THE ORIGINAL BC THIS ONE IS A PAMPHLET >:(	0
In most cases, this translation is easy to understand. In my opinion, the book would have been better though if it was translated in a slightly more modern way. Nevertheless, it is still a very good book. I think that one of the strong points about this book is that it's contents is very well organised which makes it easier read, as opposed to other translations out there where the contents of the chapters are poorly structured & are mixed along with some comments made by someone else, not by Sun Tzu! which for me, can get pretty annoying...	1
It's not even a book it's look like a short notes for the actual book.. don't get fooled by the price	0
Super Buch. Für den Kindle sehr gut formatiert. Viele Kriegsführungstipps die sich als Selbsthilfe-Tricks verwenden lassen.	1
Best book I ever read till now . . . Must read !	1
It's a little bit on tactics to win a war in ancient time. I don't know if you can use it in today's time. But nice and easy read. It was cheap so I bought it.	1
My dad always said that this book is a most for everyone and can be applied to almost everything. I think you can enjoy it and learn at least a little of this book	1
Ive red(R) the book which is must for indians keep inspiring all time and book is short simple like hand book cheap at its information Before waste in some other novels waste it for practically possible way	1
Wanted to have a copy and read this classic, it got here in time with no problems, worth a read.	1
One of the most interesting reads you'll come across.	1
Doesnt look relevant in todays context....translation to english is also problem	1
Its just the plain translation of manuscript...only 38 pages most of the verses as literally translated do not hold any meaning in English. Worst 469 rupees ever spent. Wish i can sue amazon for this stupid book. Please please do not buy.Due to this i have lost trust on online book buying.	0
Teaches life lesson	1
I purchased 9 books in one lot. Only 8 reached. I did not challenge because other 8 was useful to me and returning the entire lot did not seem a good option.	0
Excellent book.	1
Waow...reached one day earlier before delivery date thanks Amazon didnt expected wonderful... and also product is in awosome condition light weight and good quality material and printing.i recommend it go for it.	1
I personally feel that...people who are mature enough will find this book enhancing their personality traits at the end of the day.	1
Very good book to understand the today's world form this old theories	1
shorter than I expected but I am not sure if that is just the book or if this is just a short version	0
Just what it promised.... The art of war is still aplliacable to warfare as well as anything competitive. Like in corporate ladder climbing.	1
This book details out the various strategies as part of defending/attacking for a force.  However, everything described is ever relevant in everyday management context. Read this book and apply it to your life!!	1
Liked the way Sun Tzu explains the importance and power of earth and heaven and how to use them for ur benefit.	1
Ótima leitura para se colocar em prática na vida pessoal, nos negócios, e em tantos outros níveis sociais que devemos enfrentar para alcançar nossos objetivos.	1
A Masterpiece ! Those who plan for their future will get entire benefit from this book if he implement his recommendations and acts on it . Otherwise it will be mere historical account for you !	1
A good read.	1

A Classic book about Military Warfare. Thanks to Amazon and Fingerprint for the low price. Nice large texts	1
Book is very nicely written. I totally enjoyed it.	1
Overly concise. Avid readers may not like this compressed version.	1
Its interesting that Sun Tzu understood human nature so well, long before the behavioural sciences explained so many puzzling characteristics!	1
Nice read. Good ancient tricks n tips. Not of much use in present form of combats. But felt, can apply many things in day to day life	1
This is a very helpful book. However ,due to the fact that it is a pocket edition ,this is not a complete book but a very well detail summary version of book. Love this product	1
The insights in this book can be applied to: business, life, sports, relationships and other ventures. I'd recommend this book to anyone wanting to reach success, learn how to think thoroughly and rationally to achieve your objectives.	1
People will always disagree, but getting through the disagreement without the massive collateral damage that goes with conflict is a much undervalued approach. Sun Tzu offers insightful advice to help master those anxieties, manage your resources towards peace of mind and to end disagreement in the most decisive and holistic manner possible so that life can return to it's normal routine of tea and cake. He may be cunning, shrewd, devious and even ruthless, but without his no-compromise approach to obtaining peace, well.. you may well find out why one should never fight a land war in asia!	1
INSPIRATIONAL, STRATEGIC, CONCEPTUAL ON THE BASIS OF PRACTICAL EXPRIENCE	1
While the book is widely overrated, the format of the book looks cheap and not being looked after.	1
Good book , things written in the qoutes style, language is easy one can easily understand it.	1
The book is amazing and very much precise about what it wants to convey .	1
Interesting reading but, nowadays, only a few fight face to face; most just push a button in Washington DC.	1

Good book for learning tactics	1
being a teacher I find this volume the most essential text on pedagogy. When I first started my campaign against unruly classroom behaviour I found that although I would win the occasional battle the overall war was being lost. But now I command my room with absolute certainty getting to know my pupils and in the process of doing that I have come to know myself; I need not fear the outcome of a thousand battles.	1

good book for managers	1
For a book written thousands of years ago, it's quite easy to follow and it's split up very nicely into small chapters and the chapters are split into bullet points. I found myself reading a chapter whenever I had a spare few minutes, it's great to have in your library and it's definitely a must read.	1
This is not good what we expected	1
Great quality! Freshly printed. High quality book.	1
Good read. worth the price.	1

Great book.	1
Great book	1
Interesting....	1
I imagine the practicality of this book in 2014 is more sentimental rather than implementable. But worth the read no less.	1
It's a copy/ version of the original book...basically summarizes in bad English the teachings or theories of sun tzu...its not the real book as written by sun tzu...	0
Fantastic classic.  Well worth a read, even in our modern age, there is much that can be applied to everyday life. It's as though we are living in a war, but not realising it for what it is...	1
If I could score this book 2.5 I would of. It is interesting, I personally enjoyed reviews of the book, more than the book, particularly reviews found on youtube. But the book itself I found just OK.	1
This is a decent version of a classic text. It's well laid out with a table of contents making it easy to dip in and out. The ideas and strategies are individually explained in a couple of sentences, prompting the reader to muse over the ideas and gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. Originally written over a thousand years ago, the timeless wisdom contained in this gem by Sun Tzu, has been utilised by many military and business men/women for profitable advantage. This Kindle version of, "The Art of War," contains reliable insights and strategies that you can put to practical use in your daily life, in an easily digested, readable format. Colin G Smith, author of,  Difficult People: Dealing With Difficult People At Work (Quick Start Guide)	1
nothing new. all obvious but how do you do it when it counts?	1
A must have book for all the book enthusiasts out there. This edition is having the genuine translation by Sun Tzu without any interference/ editing by other authors. I would recommend this book only as there as various editions available in the market. Prompt delivery by Amazon and the quality of book is also top notch. I would insist amazon to include bookmarks with all the orders of books made from their site.	1
Die Kunst des Krieges von Sunzi gilt als frühestes Buch über Strategie und ist bis zum heutigen Tage eines der bedeutendsten Werke zu diesem Thema. Noch heute ist es Lektüre für ostasiatische Manager und Militärstrategen auf der ganzen Welt. Das Buch beschreibt die Notwendigkeit des Einsatzes aller zur Verfügung stehenden Mittel und Flexibilität zur Erreichung des Zieles und wie dies zu erreichen ist. In 13 Kapitel und 68 Thesen gegliedert, geht es auf die unterschiedlichsten Aspekte der Kriegsvorbereitung und Kriegsführung sowie deren Rahmenbedingungen ein. Über die Kriegskunst besteht aus 13 Kapiteln. 1.Planung (Strategie) 2.Über die Kriegskunst (Kriegsführung) 3.Das Schwert in der Scheide (Angriff mit Strategie) 4.Taktik (Disposition militärischer Stärke) 5.Energie (Nutzung der Kraft) 6.Schwache und starke Punkte (Schwächen und Stärken) 7.Manöver (Kampf um die Initiative) 8.Taktische Varianten (Neun Varianten der Taktiken) 9.Die Armee auf dem Marsch (Marsch) 10.Terrain (Gelände) 11.Die neun Situationen (Neun Varianten der Gebiete) 12.Angriff durch Feuer (Feuerangriff) 13.Der Einsatz von Spionen (Einsatz von Spionen) Ein Buch, welches absolut nicht an Aktualität verliert und niemals verlieren wird. Wissenswert, lehrreich und zu empfehlen. Der Preis ist dazu unschlagbar.	1
The title says it all. A work in translation. I suspect much has been lost in translation, but the book is centuries old, so it may be dated now. I'm not sure as I'm not a military person and so may not be the best person to review this book. I thought it would apply to business. Some very clever points in it, though, and I am aware this book is a classic of its kind. Well known, especially by scholars.	1
Very interesting	1
How can I, A mere blockhead, describe the greatness of this masterpiece written by a genius? All I can say is, go ahead & purchase this book. I promise that you won't be disappointed. Hats off to "Finger Print Publishers". This is my third purchase with them after " The Three Musketeers " & "The Great Gatsby", And I'm an happy customer & a huge fan. Thank you so much guys! My heartfelt gratitude.	1
It is not the actual book but a snippet from the original. The whole book is just numbered quotes. Coming to the content, the book talks about the strategies they use in wars which can be used for business strategies. But without the proper context, the points lack punch and not clear sense can be made out of the book. I bought the book for 48 bucks which was a cool deal. :D	0
This book is a complete package for enhansing life skills. Dissapointed that the selling price in amazon was more than the MRP tag on the back of the book cover (its clearly written as Rs 99 but bought it for Rs 118). Overall its a useful product.	1
MAY BE BECAUSE THE BOOK IS A SHORT VERSION, IT GAVE LITTLE NEW INSIGHTS THOUGH IN ITS TIME IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY USABLE. THE SAYINGS OF CHANAKYA IN INDIA ARE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE.	0
I was given this book to read as part of my black belt preparation and .u st admit that it is one of the hardest books I have ever read (along with The Book of Five Rings). I did not like the way this book was written as it it set out in short bullet point paragraphs, however I can understand why this book is still used in modern times as a lot of it can be adopted in other ways other than martial arts. I am glad I read this book but the way it was written has made me award this book only 2 stars.	0
I hoper for a slightly more serious version of the book. There are many pictures, and the pages have many weird, distracting ornaments on the sides. I would recommend a different version of the book (e.g. by Penguin). This book is ideal for someone who just wished for a hardcover version of this text, without any expectations concerning the design, and the book cover. 2 stars for the great source material and the okay-ish cover.	0
The book was delivered on time. The quality of paperback is ok. The book is filled with aphorisms related to war. It would be difficult to imagine the entire meaning of the aphorism and relate it to the current times. I would not recommend this version of the book to people who are looking forward to learn some incisive principles of challenges in life that are analogous to war.	1
Contents are ok, but lots of typos and amateurish layout. Size is bigger than A4 size, making it impractical to read.	0
It's all about strategy. Be it war or rat race of the modern world.	1
chatpers are point wise like in chaper 1 there are say 20 points likewise. there are no paragraphs so there is limited explaination may be its the way original book is written . now this is both poistive as its succint with clearly stating the point. but sometimes one seeks more explaination in depth to certain points. Quality of book : its good at this price point [ while i am being more demanding and want to have price lower than 60/- because its thin book but knowledge in those pages may be worth more but i am looking from no of pages , quality of pages , ink needed to print from that point of view it can be sold lesser than 60/- also ] comment: i guess a commentary book or essay book on this book or critic book on this book needs to be read to gain the indepth meaning of the points discussed in book. so that tactics used in the book can be used in other spheres [ without actual war on land ] final words: must buy [ read and gift ]	1
Hatte deutlich mehr erwartet, relativ zerstückelt, hat mir nicht wirklich gefallen, hatte mehr Hintergrund zur asiatischen lebenskultur und ggf. geschichtlichem erwartet, vielleicht zu hohe Ansprüche gehabt	0
Not what I had expected. Print quality is poor as well as the content seems to be pirated.	0

Good to know, in case you plan to command a medieval army someday.	1
曹操の注釈が読みたくて買いました。 邦訳孫子との最大の違いはその注釈にあるでしょう。邦訳孫子の註はあ くまで訓古的なもの、語句解釈のためのものです。いわば漢文で読むた めの注かと。一方英訳孫子は、文章の解釈であり、曹操をはじめとする 過去なされてきた注釈が記載されています。 なお、曹操はCAO CAO。他の人名もアルファベットだと良くわかりませ んでした。漢字じゃないと誰なんだかよくわかりませんね。	1
Mögen sie Militär? Eigentlich spielt es keine Rolle! Der Klassiker in Sachen Taktik und strategie hat viel zu bieten, egal in welchem Umfeld man sich bewegt. Die Ansichten zu Informationen und ihrer Bewertung sind ungeahnt aktuell und zählen zum kompaktesten was mir je untergekommen ist. Auch wenn die Sprache ein bisschen angestaubt liest - es ist auf jeden Fall Zeit und Geld wert.	1
Very Good for a strategist looking for an opportunity how administrations is Done in any field or situation!!!	1
Es war ein sehr einfach gehaltener Schreibstil, Inhaltlich überaus interessant doch leider kam es mir persönlich sehr kompakt vor. Man verschlingt das Buch förmlich in wenigen Stunden.	1
Timely arrived. Good job. Thanks.. But I haven't seen the book yet as I'm on travel..	1
great book, great price.	1
Easy quick read, a few good bits.	1
英語で読むと改めて意味が心に入ってくる事もあった。また、翻訳者の解説ではなく、言葉ごとに中国の武将や研究者たちの解釈を集めて、読者に理解させようとしている手法が新鮮だった。 これはひょっとして、十家註とか十一家註といわれている物の英訳でしょうか。曹操以外の中国語読みを知らないので、人名がアルファベットになった時に想像が出来ないのと、日本語の十家註とか十一家註を読んだことがないので、はっきりしません。	1

Don't order this, this is not the book it says it is. This is the one I got, with 120 pages less from an unknown author. I ordered for the book by Cleary Thomas and got a rubbish. I ordered a mass market one but got a hardcovered one with CD but the author and ISBN is not written anywhere.	0
A bit naff really.  Not what I expected at all.  I wouldn't recommend it.	0
I'm sampling all the Kindle versions of the  Art of War to pick a readable translation. Like buses that all seem to come at once, this is YET ANOTHER version of the Lionel Giles' 1910 version without the rather heavy original footnotes or the mildly useful Giles introduction. It's actually in quite readable English for the date, and seems reasonably understandable in the 21st century. I've no idea on the accuracy of the translation. Opening line from other Giles versions: "Sun Tzu said: the art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected." Prices vary considerably but the words stay the same. Update: after clattering through all the Kindle samples, this is the one I chose, because it's the cheapest, AND I can always read the original introduction by getting a sample download from another version. Simples!	1
日中韓の戦争に絡む政治論争が多いが．先ずこの本を読んでから議論すべき．戦争を平時の思考で考えることの危うさが分かる．まず，日中間の政治トップが読むべきだろう．どうも名前だけで，通暁していないふしがある．	1

[The Journey to the West (西遊記) is so well-known a story in Chinese culture that I won't bother to review the story as such, but will focus on the translation.  This book is the first volume of a four-volume translation.  This review covers all four volumes.] Any translation of a literary work, let alone between languages as different as Chinese and English are, is an exercise in compromise and cleverness.  A particular sentence in Chinese—even a single phrase—can be rendered in numerous ways in English, each one of them carrying a different set of nuances.  To maintain narrative flow, though, the translator must choose just one of those ways, which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader.  That is the compromise.  The cleverness comes in the insight and deftness with which the translator crafts and arranges those choices into a coherent whole. It is said that one should always translate into one's "A language"—that is, the language in which one is most fluent.  But Dr Anthony Yu was a native Chinese speaker, and although years of teaching in the United States made him fluent in English, it was still not his primary language.  It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this, a story that he describes as near and dear to his heart, that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped, and yet reads as sprightly and as uproariously as though it were, in fact, the original. Something must be done with those nuances, though.  Some translators choose to insert them directly into the body of the work, as Howard Goldblatt does in his translation of Mo Yan's Life and Death are Wearing Me Out.  But perhaps The Journey to the West is too full of Buddhist, Daoist, and other cultural allusions for them to be adequately captured in a passing sentence.  So Yu's translation is copiously endnoted, and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place.  Included also are scholarly citations that justify, with a degree of rigor that will probably be overlooked by the average reader, all the various word and phrasing choices he made.  In some cases, Yu's study has even found errors in the original text. The first volume of this translation adds an introduction that describes the textual history of this story, Wu Cheng'en's presumed authorship, biographical sketches of the real people depicted in the novel, and Wu's motivations for writing it, and them, the way that he did.  These additions admirably fill out the narrative and setting delivered to us so seamlessly by Yu.  Other translations may have quainter charm or somewhat more fluid English, but this one provides such a complete perspective on the novel that it presents itself immediately as the de facto standard.  A must have for the dedicated reader.	1
The Journey to the West is a lengthy 16th century novel, regarded as one of the four great classics of Chinese literature. The author of the book is uncertain, but is thought to be Wu Cheng'en. This volume contains the first twenty-five chapters of the hundred-chapter narrative, plus extensive notes and a ninety-six-page introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu. I found the introduction a difficult read, no doubt due to my prior ignorance about almost everything it covered. But the introduction was helpful, and I am glad I labored through it. The book itself defied my expectations. It was neither dry, nor dense, nor inscrutable. To my surprise, it appears to have been intended to be fun, and, despite the intervening centuries, I often found it such. The narrative is a fantastical retelling of Xuanzang's pilgrimage to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures, a pilgrimage that took place roughly a thousand years before "The Journey to the West" was written. In the retelling, there are gods, monsters, dragons, trickery, humor, and a plethora of epic fights. There is also a remarkably large amount of poetry, serving both as description and commentary, and the poetry lightened the reading. Since this volume contains only the first quarter of the story, I will postpone further comments for now.	1
Journey to the West was my birthday present to my husband — and he loved it. He read a couple of pages to me, and it put me to sleep. Reading the complete work is a labor of love for a scholarly person deeply interested in sixteenth-century Chinese culture and its integration of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. The four hefty volumes offer a mythological and allegorical version of Xuanzang’s journey to acquire scriptures in India. Ordeals along the way illustrate the stages of spiritual transformation. Xuanzang and his disciples are manifestations of the religious seeker. Dealing with the ordeals reads a bit like a detective story. Investigation reveals that the demons are often escapees from heaven. According to my husband, who read every word of the four volumes including the footnotes, the series is a fabulous exposition of Taoist internal alchemy and Chinese Buddhism.	1
I've read Journey to the West, Yu's translation, every few years for the last decade or so now. It's wonderful, and improves with every reading. There are layers of meaning, and I really appreciate Yu's scholarly footnotes. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is a bit of a mess. The Chinese characters are FAR too small to read (they're smaller than the smallest-size font, and can't be resized). This is extremely frustrating, since much of the word-play, and some of the important concepts hinge on the characters used. This needs to be fixed. I'd say, if you haven't read Journey to the West, read it. But stick with paper for the time being.	1
My 11-yr old boy loves it! He’s instantly hooked and enjoys sharing Sun Wuking’s adventures with me. I grew up reading it back in China but my son was born in the US and does not read Chinese, I’ve waited so long for him to appreciate Chinese classics! Thanks to the translator and Amazon!	1
I am only halfway through this book and I love it.  The story is so enticing that I don't want to put the book down.  The introduction was very boring but helped in better understanding of the story and should not be skipped.  Journey to the West is one of the top four books from China.  This book is worthy of every bit of the reputation I have heard.  My only regret is not having read this book earlier in life....as the saying goes...better late than never. Recommended reading.	1
I read the four-volume revised Kindle edition of this book, translated by Anthony C. Yu. The story is the fictive rendition of a journey made by a 7th century Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, during the Tang Dynasty. He undertook his famous, nearly two decade-long pilgrimage in order to study Buddhism and acquire original Sanskrit texts of the religion from India. When he returned to China, he translated many of the original texts to Chinese, thus leaving a decisive legacy on Chinese Buddhism. Some of the pilgrim's original scrolls are saved in a pagoda inside Xingijao Temple near today's Xian. The story starts with the mystical events of a creature becoming the (Handsome) Monkey King. Through various twists and turns, he acquires great skills and a variety of supernatural power which he will continue to use throughout the book. Some mischievous acts in Heaven land him in trouble but upon the departure of Xuanzang - in the book also called the Tang Monk or Tripitaka after the Three Baskets of Buddhism that held the 3 original Buddhist scrolls - from the Emperor's palace, the Monkey King is given the opportunity to become the disciple and protector of the Monk. In the first phase of the long journey Tripitaka is granted two additional converted vicious monsters as his disciples: Eight Rules who has the appearance of a pig and Sha Monk who has the look of a water buffalo. To complete the mystical traveling company, a water monster is enforced to serve as the replacement of Tripitaka's deceased horse. The bulk of the story is the description of the group's arduous traveling through impenetrable forests, burning mountains, and dangerous rushing rivers. They encounter countless demons, spirits, monsters, dragons, and fiends who invariably want to devour the guiltless Tripitaka. This enhanced interest in the Tang Monk as a culinary delight roots from his purity that is thought to guarantee extremely long life to the cannibalistic food connoisseurs. With his boundless ingenuity and smarts the Monkey King leads the three disciples to defend the Monk. For the contemporary reader, the story has a few stumbling blocks, not the least of which is the length of almost 2400 pages. In the book one will find numerous repetitions where the four main heroes tend to recite some of their earlier adventures in various situations when they meet new characters. The reader is already fully aware of these events and they tend to slow down the flow of the story. One can skip these paragraphs however, without losing much from the narration. For some readers another obstacle could be the numerous poems and songs throughout the book. In my rough estimation 15-20% of the text may well be poetry. The poems are enjoyable and usually provide finer details of, or clarifications to, the main story. As such, they are more functionally part of the book then in another classic pillar of ancient Chinese literature, the poetry in the Dreams of the Red Mansion. In that book the poems and songs are highly transcendent with the purpose of providing insight into the characters' inner selves. I skimmed through many, but not all poems. Others may decide to skip the poems altogether but those who decide to read them in even greater details, will experience an enhanced overall literary beauty of the book. Of the four characters, the Monkey King is by far the best portrayed one and the main reason I gave not 3 but 4 stars to this book. He is an absolute riot; a perfect timeless embodiment of a bad guy turned good who has a curiously complex psyche with a mixture of self-adoration, self-assuredness, mischief, steadfast loyalty, courage, wisdom, practicality, and, on the top of everything, a great sense of humor. Typical of him is the name he has chosen to himself early in the story: The Great Sage Equal to Heaven. Among all the fictive characters I have encountered in my readings, the Monkey King has become one of my all time favorites for his colorful and likeable temperament and for the exquisite perfection with which he has been portrayed. Although the Tang Monk is formally the lead-hero of the story, he really pales in comparision to the Monkey King. He is the most benevolent, spiritually pure individual imaginable who is singularly driven by his unshakable convictions and principled Buddhist mind. Unfortunately, he is also gullible to the point of annoyance and this brings a copious amount of trouble to the poor Monkey King. Eight Rules is a secondary character whose personality is also drawn with an expert pen. He is stupid, yet quite capable in many ways. His loyalty to the Monk never feels solidified, however he seems to function perfectly well under the critical tutelage of the Monkey King and the exculpation of the high-minded Tripitaka. The character of the third disciple, Sha Monk, is far less complete than the previous three and doesn't deserve particular attention in this review. Overall, the book in its full length is not an easy read. I recommend it mostly to those tickled by a potential glimpse into the spirituality of an ancient world, namely the Tang Dynasty, from the perspective of a much later, but still very old, time, namely the late Ming Dynasty. What a rare privilege to enjoy such a treasure! An abridged English translation is also available for those curious readers with a more tepid interest. Additional information: The book has served as inspiration for multiple movies, TV shows, stage plays, and comics. I saw one of these adaptations, Alakazam the Great. This Japanese cartoon film, although adorable in its own right, in no way should be considered a faithful presentation of the original story. I've also read the Ultimate Journey: Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment, by Richard Bernstein. The book adds a unique, modern-time perspective to this ancient story.	1
We went to China this summer and visited the mountain where the monkey king has his office. Since we had never read the story we decided to purchase it. It’s a long read, so it is going to take us a while.	1
For anyone into Chinese culture and Eastern  spirituality.  This is a tale (which I believe is non-fiction like everything else including the leprechaun) where you can compare yourself to the main character (Sun Wukong) and evolve with it, see yourself as a forever evolving leader. This monkey was not always godly but after learning lessons through pain you see the evolution of his character. This journey has many sub-characters too and I recommend you read this with patience and excitement both. It's a good laugh.	1
Very interesting story!  The intro was as well, a bit long and academic, but educational. The book came in good condition, smelled a little like cigarettes for some reason, but basically brand new.	1
A great translation, perfect for beginners just learning the story of the monkey king or for advanced students who want to study the text in more detail. This book helped me learn about the role Taoism and Buddhism in ancient Chinese culture, and it gave me a familiarity with one of China's most beloved folk tales.	1
Having read Waley's abridged edition "Monkey," a good amount of these opening chapters were familiar.  Nonetheless, Yu's translation reads differently enough and the complete series of events is captivating enough, that I had no desire to skip straight to Volume 2.  I wish I had had the good sense to just read a complete translation the first time.  I even find Tripitaka ever so slightly less awful thanks to Yu's introduction which offers some historical background. I thoroughly enjoyed the volume.	1
The book contains a lot of helpful footnotes explaining some of the lesser known cultural references. The story itself takes a lot of time to get going, but if you can motivate yourself to keep reading you are treated to a journey, equal to that of the oddysey, even if Tripitaka is annoying to say the least.	1
I bought this for myself after watching some interesting videos about the journey to the west. I am super excited to read it and learn more. My only dislike so far is that the package came bent in a corner and caused a bend in the book corner too.	1
Always I had loved this stoy since childhood with its different incarnations on tv and movies, and reading the actual story wrote in the 16 century is an Awesome experience. The introduction is a lil long but necessary to understand all the history and allegories that the story has, as Daoism, Buddhism & Confucianism. So isn't a children story as a lot of people used to see it..but a a TRUE literary work.	1
I fell in love with this story when i was a little kid, watching the japanese tv show from the 70s called 'monkey'. i love that show.. it is awesome. when i was in primary school, i read an english abridged version of the journey to the west. it enjoyed it, but i always wanted to read the full story. but i cant read chinese so i was never able to. until today, when i found out that a full unabridged english translation of it had been completed and available to purchase this year!  I bought all four volumes of this immediately on my kindle.. and I felt so great having the complete novel on my kindle, ready for me to read at my leisure.  I wanted to write this review to thank Anthony Yu, who i read spent 6 years translating this novel.  I am so thankful!  Thank you Mr Yu! And thank you Wu Chen En for writing this marvellous tale all those centuries ago.	1
This is a wonderful book, especially meaningful to students of the Tao.  I haven't finished it yet, because I am savoring it.  I would highly recommend the book.	1
This is a very readable translation of the Chinese classic, much better than a translation I attempted several years ago.. Not knowing Mandarin, I cannot vouch for the accuracy, but it seems complete. I am halfway through Volume 2. I recommend for anyone trying to gain a background in Chinese literature, along with Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Outlaws of the Marsh by Luo Guanzhong. All of the new Kindle versions are very good.	1
A comprehensive and entertaining take on a Chinese classic :-)	1
My son wanted this book. He has read it already and wants the next one. Maybe after Christmas.Super fast shipping.	1
Great edition of this classic book.	1
I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!	1
This is a quite stilted "professor's translation" of a classic work of literature. I can't read the original, but since this was popular writing in its day, it's hard to believe it is anything like this in the original. I discovered Arthur Waley's version (published under the title "Monkey") after I bought this, and I regret the purchase. I find it unreadable. The good doctor is to be commended for his exhausting effort to translate the entire work, which Waley did not undertake. But Yu has merely a good student's grasp of English, and writing literary English is beyond his powers, while Waley at his best has real gifts. I'd recommend this translation only if you simply must have the entire work.	1
The best English translation i've ever found. This masterpiece contains a lot of meaningful cultivation practice principles. Totally worth reading.	1
I always get pulled in the beautiful world of this fairy tale legend. Highly recommended!	1
Best book ever. Wonderful reading indeed. Never read a better book. Better than expected. Recommend to everyone who wants a good read.	1
Exciting, vivid, descriptive, engaging story. Good read for fantasy and mythology fans. In some parts language is a bit archaic but overall very good. Just started Volume 2.	1
the critical introduction is what makes this issue valuable	1
Great. happy with product and service.	1
best book ever	1
not the easiest read	1
A masterpiece	1
I read this translation together with the Chinese original, the authoritative Renmin Wenxue Chuban Se edition (third edition, released in 2010). My overall impression is that this translation is well done. Prof Yu strives to translate every single character, so the minor flattening-out found in the Jenner version isn't found here. However, at the highest level of criticism, the translation lacks a little of the brio and fun found in Waley's highly abridged "Monkey". Yu's somewhat slavish adherence to the original text yields dividends, yet at the same time sacrifices a bit of the verve. I found myself preferring to read the Chinese despite it being more difficult (a feature of the somewhat abstruse vocabulary). Another point to note is that the original writer has a very wide vocabulary, which isn't that noticeable in Yu's translation (he tends to tone down some of the more difficult words). Nonetheless, Yu's version must remain the best translation of "Journey to the West", though I won't say it's definitive like Moss Roberts' "Three Kingdoms" version for "Sanguo Yanyi". What is really splendid about this edition is a lengthy and scholarly introduction which helps lay readers understand the Daoist and textual background of "Xiyouji", and Yu's book may be recommendable for that alone.	1
Years ago I spent two-and-a-half years reading this and the other three volumes of this novel aloud as a bed time story to a lover who had listed it as her next birthday present. At the end of close to 3,000 pages I said to myself, "I'm never going to have to read another novel because nothing out there now will ever touch this work of art." After perhaps an 18-year novel reading hiatus I picked up the habit again, but still in light of The Journey to the West, I really don't know if it is worth the time and money. Over time those volumes slipped away as once-read books tend to do and so I bought this, and plan to buy the rest, just to keep them close and occasionally read a chapter or two at bed time to my wife.	1
The book cannot be enjoyed without the reader having a basic exposure to Chinese culture and history.	1
great is it. awesome it is. cool it is. good it is very. great book it is very much. great job. i like super much. best book ive ever read.	1
I've known about Journey to the west since I was a kid, it's deeply popular in asian culture. I've seen 3 different tv shows about it. If I had read this book before watching those shows, I would've thought Journey to the West was awful. The translation is extremely dry. I think it would've been better if the author took liberties and wrote the story himself rather than do a direct translation. If you are really interested in this story, watch a subtitled version of the tv show. There's not much to be had in these translated books.	0
I enjoy serious fairy tales; Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc. This is the Chinese version of the Hobbit as a prelude to Lord of the Rings. It is exceptionally sourced and cross-referenced--a little tedious at times but impossible to put down through all 4 voumes.	1
Good book to read if you are visiting China! I wanted a sense of literature from China, it was perfect.	1
I would like to read this, but $20 for a Kindle book, any Kindle book, is outrageous. The publishers are getting far too greedy.	0
I liked the look on my granddaughters face when she opened the package, it said everything.	1
Reading Journey to the West is a fairly mammoth task. It is long: I've seen the statistic that it is twice the length of Tolstoy's War and Peace. Be prepared to navigate your way through the tricky to translate metaphors in the poems, characters who use a wide variety of names and a narrative structure unlike anything a present day Western reader is expecting. Also be prepared to discover endearing characters, beautiful word use and a sense of humour and fun that defies time and cultural divides, assisted by a very thorough, accessible and beautifully written translation by Anthony Yu. When I wasn't too engrossed in the story, the footnotes at the back provided an excellent explanation of what various turns or phrase refer to and lead me to learn so much about Chinese mythology and history. While I expected that it would be a long slog to get through the first volume, I found I'd read it very quickly. Now the only thing holding me back from continuing the journey is having to purchase the next volume! As a PS, someone who is starting to read should try keeping a "Xuanzang falls off his horse" count. He seems to do it quite frequently, made me giggle every time...	1
Bought as a gift for my cousin, lovely book. Really interesting cover.	1
Very good edition, comprehensive and easy to read. A very big though, not one to carry around with you.	1
A good introduction to the Chinese classics, easy to read and enjoy, yet amazingly deep as well. Well worth reading.	1
this book is so good! I'm definitely going to e getting volume 2	1
Beautiful	1
This was probably the most difficult read of the year for me. Just getting through the introduction, which is almost half the length of the book, had me writing notes just to keep it clear. It requires a second read.	1
Obwohl die Einleitung etwas ermüdend sein kann, ist es doch hilfreich, sich ohne Kenntnis der chinesischen Religion(en) durch sie zu kämpfen. Danach liesst sich das Buch wirklich toll. Eine packende Geschichte! Gute Englischkenntnisse sind allerdings Voraussetzung - daher ein Punkt Abzug. Freue mich auf Band II.	1
If you like a bit of Monkey madness (Arthur Waley translation) and want to understand better the religion, history and philosophy underlying the original Journey to the West and Chinese religion in general then this is the book for you. A really enjoyable translation with lots of footnotes for those interested. Oh and still plenty of laughs! If the Chinese stare at you when you start laughing out loud just say XiYouJi and it will be laughs all round! The kindle version was very easy to navigate.	1
Testo fondamentale della cultura e letteratura classica cinese del XVI secolo, in una traduzione moderna, puntuale, scientifica, poetica e leggibile. Molto divertente la cosmogonia cinese.	1
This whole series I mean all four volumes, its just amazing. Beautiful poems, wow and of course the stories. Its worth a read at least for me.	1
Great book a little bit too poectic at times but good overall	1
This is the second volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, "The Journey to the West." As with the first volume, it is quite different than I'd originally anticipated. Far from being a dry, difficult, worthy tome, it is filled with taunts, trickery, battles, monsters, and a generous helping of poetry. The narrative is episodic and repetitive, but connections between the various events help thread it together. I had intended to read a chapter a day, but was often tempted into more. Although there is a great deal of violence, the tone is very light. Suffice it to say, I didn't expect a Chinese classic to contain a scene where three of the heroes pass off their piss as holy water. A radical concept: literature is allowed to be fun.	1
This is a classic series of stories that every child in China knows.  The characters are very popular.  I can now understand some comments made by Chinese speakers and TV news commentators that make allusions to this classic.  This is one of the four volumes translated by the author.  The books are heavily footnoted and suitable for serious study by English speaking persons interested in Chinese culture.  The main issue I have with the series of books is that there is a lot of repetition--based on how the stories were told over the ages.  A minor issue is that many footnotes refer to other volumes--but the Kindle edition does not give an immediate link to the other volumes.	1
The good: Some very funny stories, especially one where our hero's serve up some "golden Elixir" to some abusive Daoists. Almost made me tumble down the chair. Good veriety in settings. Lots of usefull footnotes to explain the more cryptic terms, phrases to western readers. The Bad: Deus ex machina resolutions, Little to no character development. All Tripitaka does is cry(literally) and complain, which makes him really annoying. The demons are, for the most part, terribly singleminded.	1
While this continues to have some of the flaws of other ancient epics (in particular, the incidents are somewhat repetitious) Yu's translation is an easy and enjoyable read.  On to Volume 3.	1
A must read book for all avid readers around the world!  Brought the whole series from this author's since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West.  It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me, I read over 2,000 books in 20 yrs.  After reading JW Book 1, I wanted to read the other 3 JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book 1 of JW.  Amazing story telling!	1
I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!	1
This is part two of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  It is, I believe, the closest English speakers will get to the original Chinese text.  Occasional awkwardness of wording in the translation is unavoidable as this work has gone from its original to a greatly contrasting culture. Do not let this discourage you as you read, let it instead encourage you to learn to read the Chinese original. Seeing it via one of the many movies / TV productions available is a great help in enjoying this work.  I highly recommend the CCTV production from mainland China done in both 1986 and 2000.	1
Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading.	1
My grandson loves this book	1
Love it !	1
This translation of the classic novel respects every single detail like the poetry on it	1
CLASSIC!	1
volume II, what makes this worth the money is the references and context notes by the translator	1
One of the greatest stories ever written in the category of fantasy fiction.  Highly recommended.	1
A masterpiece	1
As expected	1
This translation of Journey to the West is awesome.  I'll admit that I haven't read other translations, but, from people that I know that have read the Chinese version, and also seen the Chinese series, and I have discussed the book with them, they say it is a great translation of the book.	1
This is a great story not just this volume, I really recommend these books to be read by anyone it has everything that a great -great story need. Prepare yourself for a great journey...read the story.	1
Great. happy with product and service.	1
A really great book, I could hardly put it down.  The subtle comedy and the continuos action is perfect for anyone above 9 years old.  I LOVED it.	1
As a student of Chinese culture, this book (and other volumes) is a must. As this is considered a very good translation of the original, it took a while to find. But when I did, well, it did not disappoint.  Whether you're a student of Chinese culture, a curious reader or even a Dragon Ball fan, this book is a highly recommended read. Arrived quite fast and looks like it's new too so thank you :)	1
Very funny, gives an insight to the traditions and culture of the time of writing, the pace will keep readers on the edge of their seats. Highly recommend it.	1
This is the second entry in the 4 books and is equally interesting. Same as the first one some poems are just amazing and beautiful and lovely. And of course the story goes on.	1
The headline sums up my thougths	1
Very good book, I like it very much, it take some time to read, I hope the translation ist ok.	1
Not to be a complete cornball, but I knew I was dizzy with love for this 18th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown, adding "Be glad we haven't [naughty word]ed your dad." ...ah! I love learning about other cultures! But really, 'dizzying' is the best word for this wonderful book. The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest, the narrator shifts in and out of plotlines willy-nilly ("Who the heck is this person again?" I said way too often), the Rongguo estate is described in extremely intimate detail, there are poems on every other page, and there is some proto-magic realism going on the whole time with demons, immortals, and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life. It's all so...fascinating. It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I haven't been in a long, long, long time. Just like with any love, time for me to fess up there are some...issues. First of all, this is just 1 of 5 volumes, so it ends kinda abruptly and with 0 resolution. In fact, there is almost never any resolution ever. Or a plot period, to be honest. The story just saunters and putters around. Even the central love triangle between Dai-yu, Bao-chai, and Bao-yu hasn't really budged much so far (and by the way, Bao-yu is an incorrigible little brat. It aggravates me how much I like him). But I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed all of this. My tip is to not fret so much about trying to figure out what's going on or how everyone relates to everyone. Once I just relaxed, I surprised myself how invested I got in Bao-yu, Xi-feng, Grandmother Jia, Aroma, Tealeaf, and all the big and petty going-ons at the mansion. I can absolutely see why scholars dedicate their lives and livelihoods to Cao's sprawling, funny, and heartbreaking work.... ...I reckon I'll need a cigarette bad by the time I'm finished with this whole thing.	1
What can I say about "Story of the Stone" that hasn't already been said? It is truly one of the greatest masterpieces of world literature and I have spent nearly twenty years of my life reading and studying this incredible book, in both English and Chinese. Having read both multiple times, it should be said that David Hawkes' translation of the first three volumes if exceptional. While I don't agree with every decision he made as a translator, he always had a reasonable explanation (I've also seen his translator's notes, which is available in book form from the Chinese University of Hong Kong Press or available online for free). For example, I'm not sure about his changing of colors (e.g., "Dream of Golden Days" instead of "Dream of the Red Chamber"), but I understand why he did it, and he makes a very good case for it. What makes this translation truly exceptional (and the reason it is so much better than the English "translation" by Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang) is because it can stand on its own as a work of literary art. Hawkes' masterful prose makes the reader feel like the book was originally written in English (despite the content letting you know that it's a very different world) because of how smooth and stylish it is. He is able to not only convey the words, but the mood, tone, and feel of the book, which is very hard to do, especially with something so complex as "Story of the Stone." He took some liberties with the translations of some of the poems (of which there is a lot in this novel), but they flowed naturally in English while still retaining, by and large, their original meaning and intent. Again, that is not something easy to do, not to mention his ability to handle nearly 300-year-old Chinese humor and 'playfulness' of word games and subtle foreshadowings. David Hawkes is clearly one of the most exceptional (if not THE most exceptional) translator of Chinese literature into English that I have ever encountered. His "Introduction" in Volume I is also one of the best overviews of the novel ever written. Of course, the novel itself, translation aside, is sheer brilliance. Its vast scope, ability to engender so many different (and genuine) feelings in the reader, all of the ups and downs. It could be said that Cao Xueqin writes like a painter. His insane attention to detail and description makes the reader feel like they are really there, standing in that elegant and opulent mansion or in Prospect Garden. It is said, though, that to truly start to understand "The Story of the Stone," you have to read it at least five times. I would also strongly suggest that those who fall in love with this novel, as I have, spend some time looking for other scholarly books and articles related to the novel, because there are so many complex layers involved, and you may even find a greater sense of closure (particularly if you don't read the last two volumes, which were a forgery, not written by the original author of the first 80 chapters, who had a quite different ending in mind).	1
This story in Volume one revolves around several upper class families and shows the high level of etiquette required among family members.  The English translation is seamless and becomes beautiful in the way poetic couplets of two or more lines are presented. One meaning of the book is that it is a remembrance of the past. This seems to refer to the lives of various princely families in Nangking during the early 18th century before they were punished by the Emperor. The Chinese author was a member of these families. The original in Chinese was printed in January of 1792 and has become one of the most famous pieces of Chinese  literature. A knowledge of Chinese culture and history would no doubt increase the readers appreciation for the quality of this book.	1
This--the whole 5-volume set--remains China's greatest novel, and possibly the greatest novel in any language.  It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China ("Red Studies," from the more usual Chinese title of the book, HUNG LOU MENG, "A Dream of Red Mansions"). It really should be read by every educated person.   The other reviews on Amazon summarize the book well.  Some of them comment on the translation's accuracy, which I cannot do, being too feeble in my Chinese to follow its difficult prose.  There are several things to add, however.   I'm currently reading it for the 3rd time (I have also read the abridged translations), with an eye to studying the ways emotion is represented, for some work on emotions across cultures that I am involved in.  The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.  In fact, Cao's characters are sometimes quirky, sometimes downright eccentric, and always individuals and characters. This is (of course) a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature.   The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do, and identify Cao's characters with people they know. Cultural psychologists take note.   First is the stunning level of social commentary here, focused tightly and relentlessly on the plight of women in a traditional elite North Chinese household, but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation.  Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women (including being corrupted into not-so-good women).   Cao was humorous and gently ironic.  The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Bao-yu survives largely because of his infinitely caring, sensible, always-there maid and lover Aroma.  Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses.   Nobody in the English-language literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement.  The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin.  Cao would probably have known their work.  They had the same socially critical stance.  They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.  Cao is way ahead.   Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal, intimate, open writing about love that Cao managed so well.  There is a wonderful translation of one of Zheng's more painful and personal love poems in V. McHugh and C. Kwock, WHY I LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN, a booklet that should be more widely known--alas rare and obscure.   Moreover, this humanistic attitude--toward women, or just toward everybody--spread to Japan; think of Rai Sanyo and Ryokan.  I doubt if they ever heard of Cao, but they surely had read Yuan Mei and very likely had read Zheng and others.   There were a good number of women writers at the time.  Some were proteges of Yuan Mei. No one seems to know what happened to the women in Cao's own personal life.   Chinese society in the early Qing Dynasty was horribly hierarchic and oppressive, not least to women, but the countercurrents represented by Cao and others were powerful and important.  They lie behind modern women's movements in East Asia.	1
For people that are accustomed to the cultures of the West (Americas, Europe) it might be a chore to get interested in this book. The pace seems to be a little slow but that is because the details of daily life in China days past are different and they might just slip right past you. If you're interested in how life was lived in that part of the world, this book will be a masterpiece, as it has been in China itself.	1
One of the 4 classics of Chinese literature, it is a riveting and interesting read! Especially useful for someone who is keen to have a better understanding of Chinese culture and literature. Highly recommended.	1
One of the masterpieces of Chinese literature.  Five volumes and hundreds of characters. Has a modern feel, despite being more than two hundred years old. Fascinating book.	1
Rank and privilege in 18th century China. The family compound. Relation between relatives and the pecking order. The state loses meaning at extended family level which tend to have their own laws and customs. Subjection of women is rife, but not without protest. This book about customs is worth more than a history book in order to understand how people lived.  This is not a history book, it is a novel of customs, more about  what people thought, about respect, subservience and privilege  and mores.	1
Have not completed the book. Great introduction. Four stars just because the translation can’t express the exact details and feelings from the original Chinese version.	1
This book is one of the celebrated classics in Chinese literature. The English translation here is very good. Even the poetry is well done	1
The book looks very aged/old with yellow pages. Disappointed	0
The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone, but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me. Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!  (I find Pinyon names much easier to read).	1
Excellent novel with great view of the Chinese culture of the time.	1
arrived, no problem	1
A fascinating look at prerevolutionary China.	1
A Chinese classic well translated	1
It's a real page-turner.  As far as I can see, it's an episodic narrative without an overall structure, but that didn't prevent me from thoroughly enjoying it.  It's hard to keep track of who the characters are;  I read it on Kindle, and only at the end did I see there was a key to the characters, several pages long.  I suggest reading it in hard copy.	1
great!	1
I've read 4 our 5 translations of this classic novel and this is by far the best. I've re-read it about 5 times. It's like travelling in time and space for a vacation with extraordinarily interesting people of a different culture, but Cao Xueqin describes their thoughts and motivations in such detail that one feels a part of their world. It's a great, sprawling story by a master story teller.	1
Great novel, great translation. [...]	1
I am not sure what to say about this book after reading only one volume. It is an exquisite blend of history, fantasy, magical realism, reality, riddle and of course Chinese philosophical witticisms. There are more than 550 characters in The Story of the Stone and many with very similar names. You must get familiar with at least 50 of these characters because they are not bit players. The plot(s) are intricate but not particularly hard to follow and the pace of reading is quite brisk and easily understandable. That in itself is an accomplishment since the story takes place in China around 250 years ago and revolves around lifestyles and customs that I would imagine that most Westerners are unfamiliar with. I actually read a review where someone compared this book with Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann. I don't know about that, but the overview of the book is that it is about the decline and fall of two families. It is a highly enjoyable book.	1
Wonderful Classic	1
Fantastic condition	1
The translator notes,  the family tree diagram, and the character listing with description are well worth it.  Other translations are incomprehensible.	1
I loved this classic novel.  There are extravagant descriptions of the unbelievably lavish life-styles of those favored by the emperor, and some very surprising episodes which strike one as daring for the ancient times depicted, and thus "modern" although the values are conventional	1
This book is first of a five volume English translation of a Chinese classic, Dream of the Red Chamber (a.k.a. The Story of the Stone) composed by Cao Xueqin. It generally considered as one of China's Four Great Classical Novels. It was written sometime in the middle of the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty, and the setting of the story is early in the 18th century. This book was selected by Great Books KC group as our exposure to non-western literature for the year 2016. At the time Dream of the Red Chamber was selected for our schedule we didn't realize how long the complete work is. The Story of the Stone (1973–1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by John Minford, consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices). Total page count is 2,572. Our group decided to limit our discussion to the first volume as a more manageable reading assignment. I have no intention of completing the other four volumes any time in the foreseeable future. It's my understanding that the complete story is about the beginning grandeur and eventual decline of the aristocratic Jia family clan. As indicated by its title, The Golden Days, this first volume is focused on the beginning prosperous years. The book provides a detailed insight into wealthy Chinese cultural life of the time and the story's narrative includes frequent use of poetry. But this novel lays out a sprawling story line with numerous characters with names impossible for western readers to remember or pronounce. This is combined with excruciating details which at times can be beautiful, but overall becomes a heavy forest of words for the reader to slog through. Frankly, I didn't appreciate the experience very much. If I feel this way after the first volume I hate to imagine how I would feel should I manage to complete all five volumes.	0
David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.	1
I got the book within 24 hours. It was amazingly fast service. However, perhaps it was too fast. The cover came torn and the back cover has a significant crease as it was bent back. I'm not too far into the book, but I'm enjoying it so far. The dings that were caused in transit aren't enough to upset me. Just something to be aware of when ordering.	1
I bought this book as a gift and the person likes the story very much!! I actually just bought her the first story, but I hope she will get the following volumes too. I myself have enjoyed this book in the original Chinese edition and have loved it since I first read it. Highly recommend!	1
It is a terrible translation. . Only buy it if you must	1
A great novel, the price is good too.	1
Read the whole series.  Great.	1
This particular version and translation of the novel is very enjoyable. I find it hard to understand since i bought this book for a college Asian literature class, however it had gotten me interested in The Dream of the red chamber was well as many of the films I've found. Futhermore, the condition of the book i received was new and I was very happy about that.	1
This is an awesome book.  It is one of a famous trilogy that I happened upon while I was searching for Judge Dee mysteries.  It is magical, marvelous, and absorbing.	1
It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well.	1
Not too much to say. Dream is amazing and I'll leave my commentary on the actual novel itself there. David Hawkes did a good job, but his translation is lacking in many ways. Dream is full of puns and other language/character specific nuances. Much of the deep irony and symbolism is lost in limp and at times flippant name translations and confusing reproductions of titles that can easily leave the reader scratching their head. His choice to translate from a combination of texts provides perhaps too many opportunities for translating to become editing and revision. Still a good buy if you have no investment in Dream as anything but a cool novel someone told you about, but for those seeking a closer reading, it would be best to at least have a Chinese version at hand for comparison.	1
The Story of the Stone is an absolutely delightful tale; I only wish I could secure volume 2 since there is so much anticipation at the end of volume 1. The translation is musical and the appearance of the book itself is lovely.	1
Haven't finished it yet, but so far no violence or sexual content.	1
This is a contemporary account of life in 18th-century China.  The author is a very intelligent observer of day-to-day life in that time.  As he goes through his daily routine he encounters eunuchs, concubines, slaves, etc., which he accepts as facts of life.  The days when these manifestations of the human condition would be viewed with horror seem far away.  This book would be of great interest to students of history, but might be a bit hard to stomach for others.  (I only read the 1st of 5 volumes.)	1
If you are going to buy this book make sure you get Vol. 2 as well. Or it would be better to buy another book that has the complete story. 红楼梦	1
Let me first explicate a bit - perhaps add a disclaimer is more like it - about my approach to the book as contrasted with the other reviewers and my so-so experience of reading it.  I am neither Chinese nor a Chinese scholar, as most of the reviewers seem to be.  My only experiences with Chinese literature heretofore are Ezra Pound's translations of poets such as Li-Po and other much older poets from the Tang Dynasty period.  Thus, my approach to the book has consisted of that of a lover of Western literature dipping his toe into what all seem to regard as THE masterpiece of Asian literature.  I'm sorry if my review disappoints or rankles the devotees of this book.  On the other hand, it was my experience in reading this first volume and the review remains truthful to it. First, I do concur that this volume was obviously a labour of love by English translator David Hawkes.  Indeed, I actually found his Introduction much more interesting than the book as a whole.  He goes well out of his way in both the Introduction and the Appendix to make things as easy on the English reader as possible.  Nevertheless, with 500+ characters and (according to both Hawkes and the Chinese reviewers/translators here) altogether too many puns and wordplay for the translator to convey them all, he is rather swimming against the tide.  Also, the turns of phrase and vocabulary employed by Hawkes are very British and quite archaic; and, whilst this was quite enjoyable to me, being a native of England and a lover of its literature, it does rather skew one's experience of reading it.  At times, Bao-yu and his feminine entourage come across as precocious flâneurs or "bright young things" - a phrase Hawkes actually employs - of Interwar Oxonian vintage. Be all this as it may, Cao Xueqin, or whoever wrote the first chapter (as this seems to be in scholarly dispute) anticipates my reaction to the book, in the form of the Stone in disquisition with Vanitas, from which I quote in part: "I do not claim that they are better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time; I am only saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more effective antidote to boredom and melancholy." On the other hand, Mr. Stone, Vanitas might have replied, "It may not prove so."  It certainly did not with me, for various reasons.  It is not an unpleasant read.  There's a sort of shimmering, limpid quality to the characters and the setting.  There are even some pearls amidst the paste in the translated poetry, such as: "In vain we roam: Each in the end must call a strange land home." Or: "Heaped charnel-bones none can identify Were golden boys and girls in days gone by." But, to sum up, what is missing in all the courtier-like atmosphere and sycophantic poetics in most of this book is any sort of tension, or suspense, or, most of all, any sort of inner life at all.  Several reviewers here mention Shakespeare in comparison to Xueqin.  I simply can't imagine any of the famous soliloquies occurring in the work, or any intense focus on the inner travails of the individual which make him or her so much more important than the milieu in which s/he is situated.  Herein, everything is milieu.  A pleasant, interesting milieu, granted; but it's still mere milieu. I am full willing to grant that I may be missing something due to translation, or some idiosyncratic defect of my own, but I simply can't see, judging from this first volume, how this work can be considered great literature.	1
At the age of 19, I was involuntarily compelled to read an abbreviated translation of this novel (Dream of the Red Chamber). I remember how surprised I was to find that I enjoyed the experience. Life went on, but I thought of the book many times, and while recovering from surgery at the age of 40, it struck me that a re-read might speed me back to health. How lucky I was to have stumbled on this five-volume miracle of a translation, which is just worlds and galaxies and universes richer than that first version I’d read—and a whole lot longer, too. I’ve laughed and cried and puzzled and wondered my way through it many times since over the intervening 26 years. Reading it is an immersive experience on so many levels, and I am always amazed at how fully the author realizes his characters, some of whom are capable of making me admire them on one page, feel embarrassment for their foolishness on another, suffer with them through their losses, feel disgust at their insensitivity and even extreme cruelty, and yet still love them as human beings whose motivations I’ve come to understand intimately. Only a very few of the world’s greatest authors can render their characters in such glorious complexity, and for my money, Cao Xueqin is one of them. The author is as charismatic as they come. If you’re not yet a fan of Buddhist poetry, you soon will be. If you’re not yet into elaborate descriptions of Chinese aristocratic customs and manners now, your conversion is coming. If you think that tales of doomed teenage love are too sappy to bear, you’re going to drop that prejudice somewhere toward the end of Volume 4. And if you think it’s silly to cry buckets at the end of a novel, let Cao tell you why you’re wrong: When grief for fiction’s idle words More real than human life appears, Remember life itself’s a dream And do not mock the reader’s tears. See? The paperback copies I bought back in 1994 have been read many times and are still in decent shape. What’s not in decent shape is my eyesight, which is why my last couple of readings of “the stone” have been on Kindle. I hope to read it at least a few more times while I inhabit this incarnation.	1
This review applies to the first three volumes of this story. This is a typical Chinese fable  involving hundreds of characters. It follows the growth and interactions of a large well to do family and it's branches. This in itself makes it difficult to keep track of each one but it is made even more difficult because each character is referred to by more than one name. Their given name, their relationship name ( Auntie Xue..) and their nickname. Aside from that the storyline is rather mundane and does not move along at a satisfying pace. But the biggest complaint is the translation, I have read other Chinese fables and have found them a satisfying read however this translator seems to have written his own tale. And it is done more as an English Victorian tale in words and phrases rather than a Chinese fable.And in his lengthy introductions he admits he has taken liberties with the earlier manuscripts and translations. His language is not at all reminiscent of other Chinese translations in use of words or idioms . While there are more volumes left to read I will not go beyond the first 3.	0
This book is probably the best translation from Chinese into English. The choice of archaic English words and phrases preserves the tone and style of the original Classical Chinese texts. Even the poems when translated into English are rhythmic. The translator has a profound knowledge of Chinese culture, history and Buddhism. The story setting, complexity, entangled relationship among people, subtle feelings within characters are stunningly preserved. The main character Baoyu and Daiyu jumps out in front of you	1
This magical novel portrays a traditional society turned upside down: a boy who'd rather be a girl, women who are more powerful than men, and a faerie who delivers the most licentious of messages. Much of this panorama takes place within the tranquil gardens and hand-carved edifices of the Jia family mansions, where life is constantly in flux. Cao Xue-qin calls this The Land of Illusion, an ethereal contrast to the realm of the soul, where reality's as hard as rock but stones can talk; the author's interesting philosophy is presented with admirable wit and humility, too. Ontologically speaking, souls of all kinds travel between two realms that mirror each other on an elusive search for bliss. "Truth becomes fiction when the fiction's true;/ Real becomes not-real where the unreal's real," the novelist writes, only to lament, "The disillusioned to their convents fly;/The still deluded miserably die." Life for the Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family is painful, chaotic, and scandalous. Yet sophisticated readers will marvel at Cao's expressive art and soaring lyricism--and David Hawkes's English translation is superb in its life and immediacy. The protagonist Bao-yu's object of desire, the fragile and elusive Dai-yu, is, quite literally, a Crimson Pearl Flower incarnate, and the volatile relationship between them is beautifully rendered. Born with a shimmering piece of jade in his mouth, Bao-yu shares her mystical origins, to be certain, but sensing their bond, he struggles all the more for it. What is the essence of her, he seems to ask, and what is the essense of me? When, in a moment of levity, some feminine beauties ask him "wherein lies your preciousness and wherein lies your hardness," the question wryly ambiguous, Bao-yu concludes with innocence: "No real Bo-tree the body is,/The mind no mirror bright./On what could dust alight?" A Western reader might quarrel with his answer, but in Cao Xueqin's masterful hands, reality is a lump of jade we can kick--a realm where moments of truth will fade to laughter and celebration.

I spend a lot of time wandering through bookstores.  One particular book has caught my eye over the years, and the other day I bought it - Volume 1 of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth century epic, "The Story of the Stone:  The Golden Days".  As a developing eighteenth century scholar, I was doubly attracted to it.  "The Golden Days" absolutely blew me away - used as I am to eighteenth century novels (British, French, American), this is wholly unlike anything I've read from the era.  It bears structural similarities to the Laurence Sterne's "Tristram Shandy" and "Sentimental Journey," but aside from that bears more in common with ancient Greek novels like Longus's "Daphnis and Chloe" or Heliodorus's "Eithopian Romance," as well as the mysticism of the ancient Egyptian "Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor."  And yet, Cao's attention to actual life experiences, and the detail he conveys about tradition and ceremony, along with frank dealings with human relationships and sexuality makes "The Golden Days" much more than any quick summary of style or content can relate. "The Golden Days" begins in amusing, but sympathetic fashion:  the goddess Nü-wa is repairing the sky with 36,501 stones.  When she finishes, one remains, which is cast off.  Having been touched by a goddess, this stone has magical properties, able to move, change size, and even talk.  One day, a Buddhist monk and a Taoist come upon the stone, and promise to let the stone have an adventure - to become human.  As the stone waits by a pond, it falls desperately in love with a Crimson Pearl Flower, which is also selected for incarnation by the Fairy Disenchantment.  The stone and the flower are incarnated as the novel begins in earnest, as a young minor nobleman named Jia Bao-yu, and a commoner related to the family, a girl named Lin Dai-yu - both unaware of their heavenly origins.  "The Golden Days" centers around the daily events and occurrences in the lives of these two teenagers, as they come to grips, as we all must, with human life. The Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family, on opposite sides of Two Dukes Street, are the centerpieces of the novel's action.  Like the "big house" fiction of the English eighteenth century, these ancestral manses provide a locus of activity, as the nobles, their extended families, friends, and servants mingle and interact constantly.  Cao marks himself as a remarkable author by the way he handles a massive cast of characters, letting us into the private lives and concerns of all ranks of society, as well as the forms of etiquette that determine their relationships.  Another terrific facet of the novel's construction is the almost stream of consciousness style Cao employs - as characters pass in and out of the immediate action of the novel, the narrative seems to choose the person it's most interested in and follow them for pages at a time, before seamlessly passing to the next character.  It's really quite amazing, how, in this way, we come to understand the motivations, fears, and hopes of so many individuals.  Time, distance, culture, Cao levels distinctions, making historical China accessible to even 21st century readers - he reduces people to their human concerns. Cao Xueqin's novel is also remarkable for what I can only call it's pro(to)-feminist tone.  While we are reminded by certain characters that male lineage is of major importance to the structure of the society, the narrative consistently shows the power, ability, and influence of women.  At the novel's beginning, a Taoist named Vanitas finds the stone, and is asked to transcribe its story, but complains initially that it is about a "number of females".  The stone obviously insists that the story be written out.  Later, Bao-yu, the major male character, says he is more comfortable around women - that they are like water, while men are like mud, castoffs, unclean.  One of the main characters of this volume is Wang Xi-feng, a young woman in her early twenties, who for an extended period, manages the affairs of both the Ning and Rong mansions.  Cao's respect and admiration for the strong women in Bao-yu's life:  Xi-feng, Dai-yu, and two particular servants, Aroma and Caltrop, is quite obvious and important to the novel. If you are like me, and know tragically little about Chinese literature and culture, Cao takes care of that too - there is a heavy emphasis throughout the novel on the cultural productions of China.  The book integrates a wide range of poetry, drama, fiction, folk wisdom, and mythology as a central part of Bao-yu and Dai-yu's upbringing.  One can sense Cao's insistence in the novel that education and cultural production is of vital importance, particularly to children.  While the Fairy Disenchantment seems to be the guiding spirit of the novel, hinting at the diappointments inevitable in the course of life, this is a novel about youth, and hope for the future, even in the midst of concern about how long prosperity can last.  Taken altogether, "The Golden Days" cannot be recommended enough.  David Hawkes's translation is first rate, and his introduction, pronunciation notes, and appendices are thorough and very helpful.	1
Written in 1750, The Story of the Stone is an impressive and fascinating tale that incorporates otherworldly magic and mysticism with the saga of wealthy Jia family.  The five-volume story chronicles the family's high-living glory days through their bitter decline, all the while immersing the reader in rich details of daily life in 18th century China.  I completely agree with the following quote from the Times Higher Educational Supplement: "an astonishing book.  It recreates a world that would otherwise be utterly lost."  Anyone even mildly interested in Chinese history and culture will be enthralled by this glimpse into the privileged world of wealthy 18th century Chinese. Author Cao Xueqin was truly a creative genius - Story of the Stone is multi-faceted, multi-dimensional, and superbly crafted. While reading the first chapter of the first book (Dream of the Red Chamber), I was struck with how utterly clever and imaginative the story is.  You will instantly be aware that you are reading something that has endured almost three hundred years for a very good reason.  The story is populated with dozens of wonderfully three-dimensional characters - many of whom are woven in and out of the story making for a most interesting read.  Most notable is the spoiled and curiously effeminate protagonist Jia Bao-yu, who possesses a special, magical item that I won't reveal here (don't want to spoil your enjoyment of the book!). All of the elements that make traditional Chinese literature such a joy to read are embodied in Story of the Stone.  Elaborate settings, delicate verse, and traditional symbolism (with a healthy dose of humor and bawdiness) create a beautiful and riveting story that will keep you wanting more.  I highly recommend reading the entire 5-book series.  It is impressive that a work can stand the test of time as well as Story of the Stone has. David Hawkes' fine translation is excellent.  Although some have criticized him for using too much "slang," I feel that his translation is effective in expressing the character's true sentiments, and it is tremendously easy to read.  Story of the Stone is an unforgettable and awesome read that I highly recommend.	1
Well, in my opinion anyway. David Hawkes has done an amazing job translating this brilliant 18th-century novel into colloquial modern English. I have read all the translations-- this is my favorite novel, and this is by far the best version for an English speaker who just wants a good book. I can imagine that a Chinese reader could pick holes in this translation, as I could nitpick at a translation of Shakespeare-- the wealth of the original is impossible to transfer whole into another language and culture. If you want a word-for-word translation so you can use this as a study guide while you read the Chinese, maybe the wooden Beijing Languages version could help you! But I have a hard time imagining any new translation being more vivid and fun to read than this one. Yes, it is littered with sometimes annoying Britishisms. That is the price of a colloquial translation! It's true that Hawkes does not explain all the references-- that would be another book in itself.  And I am sure he made mistakes-- I help a French translator occasionally and even though he is very well-versed in English, it is so easy for him to miss something that only a cultured native speaker could pick up. But this translation is ALIVE. Until that perfect translation comes along one day, Hawkes's is still better than all the others. Be grateful to him! (2003)	1
The Dream of the Red Chamber (The Story of the Stone) starts off as an immensely long inscription on a miraculous stone which was copied out by a visiting man and taken down into the world for publication. Volume 1 gives the account of the magic stone's origin, renders the discourse redolent of a supernatural, mystical overtone. Once upon a time a piece of stone that was unworthy to be used for repairing the sky possessed magic power and ended up in the mortal world. The unhappy stone incarnated and lived out the life of a man before finally attaining nirvana and returning to what Buddhist refers as the "other shore." Jai Baoyu is the incarnation of the stone. The name "bao-yu" means "treasured jewel" and was named after the wonderful incident that the only surviving son of the Jia household was born with a piece of spotless jade in his mouth. Lin Daiyu, Baoyu's teary cousin with a superior intelligence, is the incarnation of the Crimson Pearl Flower, which the unhappy stone once conceived a fancy that he took to watering everyday so the flower was able to shed the form of a plant and became a girl. The consciousness that she owed the stone ensued her to repay him with the tears shed during the whole of a mortal lifetime if they were ever to be reborn as humans in the world beneath. It was no wonder when Daiyu first saw her cousin, who had tyrannized the household, hated studies, and spent most of his time in women's quarters, it was as though she had seen him somewhere before, like a déjà vu. Aside from the ethereal origin, the first volume of The Dream of the Red Chamber depicts a fairly eventual record of a great Manchu household (Qing Dynasty) under the tutelage of the Imperial family in early 18th century China. It's the picture of daily routines in the life that emerge most vividly from its discourse. The Jia household is genuinely disguised as some highborn aristocrats whose ancestors were ennobled for their military powers. This first installment of five parts, titled Golden Days, captures the Jias at the hi-time in which members of the Rong-guo mansion and the Ning-guo mansion dressed in silk, ate delicately, pampered by a domestic hierarchy of servants and maids, when they were still nested in the protecting shadow of the ancestors and the readily accessible wealth. The family's decline and fall constitute the general background of the novel. With over 500 characters, thousands of one-hit appearances and a skein of household members and their distant relations of the clan, reading of The Dream of the Red Chamber will be more pleasurable and rewarding with the family genealogy handy. The book has a general flow of daily happenings and inter-family drama, with an emphasis on the relationship between Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu. Household activities, domestic anecdotes, subbing rivalries, seditious schemes, love affairs, contention between concubines, political intrigues, black magic, witchcraft, and even murder constitute to the pages of this Chinese epic that evokes Remembrance of Things Past and One Hundred Years of Solitude. The heart of the novel is the pre-destined relationship between a semi-ethereal entity and magic stone under the context of the Buddhist understanding that earthly existence is an illusion. This meeting, though is meant to be, is in vain, one that is full of tears. When the fairy led Baoyu into the land of illusion and showed him his fate, he could scarcely make out of what he saw. Nature might have endowed him an eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton. How does one expect a 13-year-old (scholars deem him to be 13 throughout most of the book) to recognize and seize his destiny? The fairy showed him not only his life cycle but also the romantic passions, love debts, heartbreaks of dust-stained human world. Baoyu was destined to mingle with girls around him. The ancestors thought Baoyu had inherited a perverse, intractable nature that rendered him eccentric and emotionally unstable. Exposure to the worldly illusions of decay might hopefully succeed in enlightening, awakening, and transforming him. Daiyu seems to know Baoyu more thoroughly than anyone does. She is able to nail his problem despite her occasional tiff with him over trivial matters. Baoyu always complained about people's getting angry with whatever he did, but he never realized how much he had provoked them at the first place. Couplets, poems, and verses in the novel hint at his friendlessness in the mortal world and the incessant debate over the depth of his relation with Daiyu. The roaming back and forth, sink and soar between sorrow and elation between the two incarnated cousins constitute to the understanding that earthly existence is indeed a transience but karma determines the shape of one's life and the life after. This idea of life being a dream from which one eventually awakes is a Buddhist tenet, but the incorporation of it into the novel becomes a poetic gesture to demonstrate that the main character (Baoyu) is indicative to the author. The Dream of the Red Chamber in Chinese has the connotation of being rich and grand. The title can refer to a dream of the vanished splendor and opulence. The frequent use of dream imagery implies the possibility that the luxurious world of the author's youth, which he attempted to reconstruct, had vanished so utterly at the time of writing. The story of the Jias closely accorded with fortunes of Cao's own family, which attained its height under the reign of Kangxi. But the exact relationship existing between characters of the novel and members of Cao family is uncertain and discreet. Baoyu is assured to be author's self-portrait, whose struggle towards emotional maturity was delineated with an affluence of nuance. Other characters could be compsite of several family members over different generations for the purpose of disguising facts.	1
I'm surprised that I had never heard of this novel until recently. Covering five volumes and over 2,000 pages, it was written in the eighteenth century and depicts the life of the aristocracy in ancient China.  The first volume introduces us to many characters, and it's tough getting them all sorted out, mostly due to names that are quite foreign to Western readers.  However, the narrative is so natural and flows so easily, I found it quite easy to submerge myself in the story.  Perhaps the translation is to be credited, because although the tale is set over 250 years ago, I never felt as though the characters were anything but recognizably human.  I intend to read the remaining four volumes.  Quite absorbing and unique.	1
I just finished a class devoted to the study of The Story of the Stone (aka Honglou Meng, Dream of the Red Chamber) and feel completely awed by the complexity and skill of Cao Xueqin. This novel thoughtfully and naturally weaves together several timeless human themes. If you enjoy literature which requires analysis at several different levels simultaneously, you'll love this book. Two notes for those who don't speak Chinese: 1)Learning the characters' names is difficult even for those with a background in Chinese, but the translator does do readers a favor by translating servants' names into English equivalents/approximations while leaving the names of the main family members in (romanized) Chinese. 2)Keep in mind that two of the most important families are named Jia and Zhen, which mean "false, phony, artificial" and "true, real, genuine" respectively. (This is just one of many iinteresting and meaningful messages inevitably lost in translation) Also, in my opinion, the first three volumes (written by Cao) are much better than the last two volumes (written by Gao E). Still, it's interesting to compare the ways Gao changes the story.	1
I love the Story of the Stone, and overall I enjoyed this translation (in fact I read all five volumes!!). The only things I didn't like was the use of modern english slang in some areas, and the poetry translations. Otherwise, the set is a marvelous translation of a great classic. The Story of the Stone is a novel that should be included in any true curriculum of the "great books". There are sequences that are emotionally moving and powerful. This is the most complete translation in English I am aware of.	1
This is the first volume of a 5 volume series, and does not stand alone. If you read it, and enjoy it, be prepared to read the other four volumes. The story is difficult to begin with, not for lack of interest, but because of the complexity of Chinese names for the western reader. The book is  provided with a useful list of characters for each volume, and after  referring to this during the first half of the first volume, all becomes  clearer for the remainder of the book. The story itself is a fascinating  picture of life in 18th century China, and portrays the development of a  young boy who has otherworldly origins. The western reader needs to view  dispassionately the Buddhist theme which pervades the novel, but when read  with an open mind, the philosophy underlying the novel is both charming and  practical (in its own way). I found the book addictive, though it has to  be said that others of my acquaintance found it too difficult to cope with,  and abandoned the story before the end of the first volume. If you  persevere, it forms a wonderful introduction to classical Chinese  literature, and those similarly addicted will find it leads into many other  books of Chinese prose and poetry.	1
The reader will be disappointed if he is expecting lots of thrills and twists and turns. This is not that kind of book. Rather, Story provides an engaging peek into the lives of an upper-class family in feudal China. The story takes a little patience at the beginning due to the large number of characters. But the reader will soon realise that how the characters are related to one another is not crucial to appreciating the book. Rather, each character has its own personality, strengths and weaknesses, and comes alive in its own right. I believe that the reader will, like me, come to feel for the characters in no time and look forward to finding out how their lives evolved in the later four volumes. David Hawkes' translation cannot be faulted. The writing flows easily and the flavour of the allegories and poetry are, to a large extent, retained.	1
* A Non-Chinese reader should beware of the fact that no matter how good 'Dream of Red Chamber' is translated into English, the gap between English & Chinese original is still huge, for several reasons: 1. The language Cao used is not the Mandarin that Chinese are using today, they were more subtle, superb, to the degree that author is capable to densify and enliven a whole paragraph in English into several sentences. (I will take some examples later...) 2. Cao was born from a noble family, he was well trained in Ancient Chinese Philology, Prosody, Rhetoric, thus the gamut of knowledge and references cause huge problems not only for Western Scholars (which are very few), but also Eastern Stone-Scholars. 3. The vissicitude of Cao's family is unimaginable to a modern reader, the richness of language, emotion and situation in which the author wrote this book render more subtlety than modern readers can fathom and writers alike to apply. 4. Too many puns, quibbles, word plays and moods of Chinese poetry are heavily distorted by both English and translator, and the names Cao gave to the characters always 'imply' something: Jia BaoYu (贾宝玉）implies 'precious jade', Lin DaiYu （林黛玉），黛 had several meanings, it can be used to describe a beauty, green color or the the material women used to draw eyebrows, of course it's an extremely feminine Chinese character for women. Xue BaoChai (薛宝钗）implies 'precious hairpin', Etc.... I am distraught by the fact that the translator never mentioned on this. * I will take one paragraph from Chapter 27 in Volume II, if you don't understand Chinese, you can compare the length of them. 紫鹃雪雁素日知道林黛玉的情性 ：无事闷坐 ，不是愁眉 ，便是泪眼 ，且好端端的不知为了什么 ，常常的便自泪自叹的 。先时还有人解劝 ，或怕他思父母 ，想家乡 ，受了委曲 ，只得用话宽慰解劝 。谁知后来一年一月的竟常常的如此 ，把这个样儿看惯 ，也都不理论了 。所以也没人理 ，由他去闷坐 ，只管睡觉去了 。那林黛玉倚着床栏杆 ，两手抱着膝 ，眼睛含着泪 ，好似木雕泥塑的一般 ，直坐到二更多天方才睡了 。一宿无话 。至次日乃是四月二十六日 ，原来这日未时交芒种节 。尚古风俗 ：凡交芒种节的这日 ，都要设摆各色礼物 ，祭饯花神 ，言芒种一过 ，便是夏日了 ，众花皆卸 ，花神退位 ，须要饯行 。然闺中更兴这件风俗 ，所以大观园中之人都早起来了 。那些女孩子们 ，或用花瓣柳枝编成轿马的 ，或用绫锦纱罗叠成旄尾执事的 ，都用彩线系了 。每一颗树上 ，每一枝花上 ，都系了这些物事 。满园里绣带飘飖 ，花枝招展 ，更兼这些人打扮得桃羞杏让 ，燕妒莺惭 ，一时也道不尽 。 Nightingale and Snowgoose had long since become habituated to Dai- yu's moody temperament; they were used to her unaccountable fits of depression, when she would sit, the picture of misery, in gloomy silence broken only by an occasional gusty sigh, and to her mysterious, perpetual weeping, that was occasioned by no observable cause. At first they had tried to reason with her, or, imagining that she must be grieving for her parents or that she was feeling homesick or had been upset by some unkindness, they would do their best to comfort her. But as the months lengthened into years and she still continued exactly the same as before, they gradually became accustomed and no longer sought reasons for her behaviour. That was why they ignored her on this occasion and left her alone to her misery, remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves with their own affairs. She sat, motionless as a statue, leaning against the back of the bed, her hands clasped about her knees, her eyes full of tears. It had already been dark for some hours when she finally lay down to sleep. Our story passes over the rest of that night in silence. Next day was the twenty- sixth of the fourth month, the day on which, this year, the festival of Grain in Ear was due to fall. To be precise, the festival's official commencement was on the twenty- sixth day of the fourth month at two o'clock in the afternoon. It has been the custom from time immemorial to make offerings to the flower fairies on this day. For Grain in Ear marks the beginning of summer; it is about this time that the blossom begins to fall; and tradition has it that the flower- spirits, their work now completed, go away on this day and do not return until the following year. The offerings are therefore thought of as a sort of farewell party for the flowers. This charming custom of `speeding the fairies' is a special favourite with the fair sex, and in Prospect Garden all the girls were up betimes on this day making little coaches and palanquins out of willow- twigs and flowers and little banners and pennants from scraps of brocade and any other pretty material they could find, which they fastened with threads of coloured silk to the tops of flowering trees and shrubs. Soon every plant and tree was decorated and the whole garden had become a shimmering sea of nodding blossoms and fluttering coloured streamers. Moving about in the midst of it all, the girls in their brilliant summer dresses, beside which the most vivid hues of plant and plumage became faint with envy, added the final touch of brightness to a scene of indescribable gaiety and colour. * Thus for those who think this book is greatly written, you are right, but the original one is incomparably more gorgeous.	1
I think the most important quality of this piece of literature that qualifies it among the all-time classics is the layering of progressive ideas within traditional Chinese philosophy and structure. The oppression censorship required Cao Xueqin to disguise all relatively innovative and rebellious themes under apparent themes of acceptance the current political and cultural status quo. The strict censorship also explains why the final editors toned down the material before publishing the novel and the last 2 volumes fail to remain faithful to the true gold of the first 3 volumes.  All good literature questions society and the individual, a skill in which Cao Xueqin proves to master. I highly recomend this book to any patient readers. If you struggle with deciphering the complex web of Chinese philosophy, I also recommend reading Andrew Plaks' "Archetype and Allegory in Dream of the Red Chamber".	1
This book was fascination not only for the cultural review of 1700's in Manchu (Qing Dynasty) China and aristocratic households of the day, but also for the introspective look at family dynamics and confucian practices in the time.  With the tragic/romantic form of writing one feels a longing to understand how different life was in those times and places.  I also got a great feel for what the writers intent was and the criticisms of political changes through the translaters appendixi and annotations.  Great reading for thinkers!	1
I put it down after about 40 pages, just better things to do with my time. Boring	0
I found it hard going, when I started to read it. Perhaps it would suit someone more able than me. Perhaps given more time, I will try again.	1
I wouldn’t call this an exciting story however it is fascinating to see into the way of life of the very rich.	1
Following on from Michael Wood's BBC series on the history of China, I bought several books, including this one. I am enjoying reading it and will continue with the next book in the series when I have finished this first novel in the series.	1
Excellent translation.  Fascinating.	1
enjoyable funny insight into a world that no-longer exists , but every character recognizable in their flaws and failings and all the more loveable for that fact	1
Perfect present	1
Brilliant.	1
Good read	1
I thought I'd sample some Oriental literature and decided to dive into this epic family saga. Having read this first volume and the second volume, I am very happy with my purchase. It is tough to familiarise yourself with all the different characters in the book, but very soon you realise that the abundance of people within this one family household is one of the delights of the story. There's always something going on, be it the concerns of the aged Grandmother Jia, the loveable oddities of Bao Yu, or the frettings of the vast array of maids. Don't expect anything dramatic to happen every twenty pages otherwise you'll be disappointed. This novel moves very slowly. But it is meant to be realistic and this again is part of the charm. Through reading its pages you learn a lot about Chinese culture of that time and this is exciting in its own way. I read the first volume and fell in love with the characters so much that I could not conceive of not carrying on with the remaining four volumes. I think that is a testament to how good the book is and, indeed, the translation.	1
As I was pondering what to read next, I realized that this piece of work, which runs to nearly 2,200 pages (double the size of War and Peace), will be a perfect foil for the long evenings during the Covid-19 lockdown period. I started reading in earnest on May 1 and finished it on May 31. The 18th century saga, which is believed to be based on the author’s own life and intended as a memorial to the twelve Nanjing women that he knew in his youth, maps the rise and fall of two closely-related noble families. The characters, profligate by nature, waste away the immense ancestral wealth in frivolous activities, and often times find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Imperial authorities confiscate the family properties once their misdeeds come to light. After much tragedy, the family is eventually restored to its former position by the Emperor. And in-between all this fateful happenings, the great passions and follies plays out in full flow, which in a contrasting manner are set against the backdrop of the Karmic Law that lays emphasis on the intemperance of life on earth. Overall, the book is full of details relating to the social, cultural and spiritual life of the time. The Penguin translation was titled “The Story of the Stone” based on the novel’s frame story in which a sentient heavenly stone is sent to earth to live out the drama of human passion (one of the main characters, Jia Bao Yu, is born with a jade in his mouth thereby suggesting that he was the sentient stone sent to earth by two enigmatic Taoist and Buddhist priests). I still wish the Penguin had gone with the title “Dream of the Red Chamber” instead of “The Story of the Stone”. I think the title “Dream…” conveys a better sense of the underlying theme than the “Stone…”. The novel has some spectacular supernatural elements. Volume 1 has some good dose of the supernatural, but in sharp contrast, Volume 2 is completely devoid of it. Volume 3 has one or two sequences. It picks up pace in Volume 4 and reaches the zenith in Volume 5. The dreams, nightmares, premonitions, seances, and apparitions can spook anybody and borders on the horror genre. However, all the sequences are so beautifully blended into the narrative in such a way that they don’t feel out of place. Somehow, all those supernatural elements feel “real” like how one would feel the happenings in a dream as “real.” That is the big success of this novel. When the going is good, none of the characters pay heed to any of the superstitions, but as their fortunes begin to dwindle, you can observe that one by one slowly falling prey to many superstitious practices. This is a great insight into people’s psychology of clinging on to a sense of certainty and security as the world around them crumbles. None of the characters can either be classified as “good” or “bad” in binary terms. Each one has their good side as well as the bad side. Perhaps this is the great strength of the novel as it lays emphasis on the shades of grey when it comes to judging a person’s actions. Often times, you can justify a character’s actions from his or her point of view but cannot be justified from the other’s person’s perspective. One can spend a lifetime researching this novel. Don’t hesitate to enter the dream world created by the good old Cao Xueqin.	1
Tremendous achievement on David Hawkes' part. Very good this is available on Amazon Kindle.	1
Es uno de los mejores libros que he leído. Tengo los cinco volúmenes en tapa blanda y me lo compraría para kindle si no fuera porque el vol.III no está en ese formato! Por qué cuatro volúmenes si y uno no? Por fin el vol.III!! Gracias!!!	1
The book is fantastic and pretty interesting however the book did not arrive in excellent conditions.	1
hier ein paar Attribute zum Buch: * gutes Englisch erforderlich * enormer Umfang * überraschend mystisch * insgesamt Genre schwer einzuordnen	1
Slow start and must be confusing for the Western reader who are not familiar with Chinese culture.  Lots of names and inter-relationship between the characters to get to grip with. Book 1 & 2 is all about the good life.... lots of eating, partying and generally having a good time.  The translation is good and I think it's a great idea to leave main characters' names as it is pronounced in Chinese but the maids etc are translated into easy to remember English names.  Overall, enjoying the read and can't wait to go through the whole 5 volume to find out what happen.	1
la roman a une très belle couverture avec la culture chinoise forte et attractive.  c'est la meilleure version anglaise que j'ai jamais savoir, non seulement pour les lecteurs occidentaux, mais pour les lecteurs chinois aussi.	1
Sehr interessant und auch überraschend kurzweilig wird das Alltagsleben einer großen chinesischen Adelsfamilie beschrieben. Der Band ist mit "The Golden Days" untertitelt, und diesen Eindruck hat man beim Lesen auch: Der Überfluss und die Dekadenz, die Ritualfixierung des Alltagslebens und der ständige Ennui bei gleichzeitiger dauernder Unruhe dieser privilegierten Schicht wird sehr plastisch geschildert. Diese Kapitel des Romans wirken unbeschwert und leicht; vom späteren Niedergang ist noch nichts spürbar. Der Leser, der moderne Romane gewohnt ist, wird sich auf ein paar Eigenheiten der klassischen chinesischen Romane einstellen müssen. Auch wenn das vorliegende Werk das Erbe der mündlichen Weitergabe schon deutlich hinter sich lässt, sind immer noch typische Merkmale, wie die Einleitungsgedichte, die Kapitelschlussformulierung und die in Gedichtform eingestreuten Umgebungsbeschreibungen vorhanden. Auch der für chinesische Romane typische Überfluss an Personen kann etwas einschüchternd wirken, gerade zu Beginn; die ersten 5 Kapitel sind nicht leicht zu lesen, danach wird es deutlich besser verständlich, wenn die wichtigsten Figuren eingeführt sind. Man darf natürlich bei diesem Werk auch keine sprachliche Ausgefeiltheit wie bei Mann oder eine Charakterisierung wie bei Dostojewskij erwarten, dazu ist die Gattung bei diesem Roman noch nicht weit fortgeschritten genug. Trotzdem bietet sich dem Leser ein Familiendrama, das einen schnell in seinen Bann zieht. Der hier vorliegende Band 1 enthält die Kapitel 1 bis 26 (von 120), man muss sich also auch die anderen 4 Bände zulegen, um die Geschichte ganz zu lesen. Eine gelungene Einführung und äußerst hilfreiche Familienstammbäume runden das Werk ab. Die Übersetzung von David Hawkes ist sehr gelungen und hat neben einigen leseerleichternden Kunstkniffen (Namensübersetzung von Nebenpersonen) auch einen sehr angenehmen Fluss zu bieten, in dem weder die (homo-)sexuellen Anspielungen noch die teilweise deftige Sprache untergehen. Wem dieses Werk gefällt, kann sich auch "Die Gelehrten" (Rulin Waishi, "The Scholars") ansehen, da sowohl Thematik als auch Stil recht ähnlich sind.	1
I have long sought to start reading this six volume story - a classical Chinese story and I find a reasonably priced copy in USA - order it - Lo! It is delivered efficiently - good deal. Great.	1
I was rather taken in by other reviews.  This book is very difficult to "get into" and the extensive preamble, really intended for more scholarly minds than mine, is very off-putting.  I have put the book away for the time being , probably a better read on cold winter nights	1
In spite of enthusiastic reviews, most Westerners will find this hard going, although it does illustrate the weird formalistic and ritualistic life-style and etiquette of high-up Chinese in the 18th century, when coming up with the right poem at the right time seemed to be the key to advancement. Good as an insight into this strange life-style, but repetitive. Could n't face another four volumes!	1
good	1
The book arrived on time and in a pristine condition, as described. Thank you very much.	1
Anthony Yu grew up hearing the tales of Monkey.  While with the University of Chicago he decided to translate this masterpiece, preserving the verse and as well as the prose sections of this classic work.  One of the great pieces of Chinese literature (along with Dreams of Red Mansions, Three Kingdoms, Outlaws of the Marsh, etc.).  The verse will be stiff at times (Chinese verse into English is always a challenge), while references will easily escape a Western audience, it is still enjoyable for the many adventures, philosophical leanings and even comedic elements that give this classic a timeless feel.  For all it's flaws there really is no better translation into English.	1
The funny stories present in the first two volumes are almost nowhere to be found in this one (there is one). Moreover several of the stories revolve around sun wukong simply not bothering to inform his allies of the opponent's special items and abilities. The good: *settings and cultural differences between the human regions are well written. * The stories themselves are varied in plots. * Anthony Yu's notes are invaluable for readers who are not eastern culture buffs. The bad: * The demons vary very little exept for in appearance. One demon sounds and acts almost identically to the next. * Tripitaka is still very annoying. * When sun wukong finally comes across a worthy challenge a bodhisattva is almost instantly introduced to resolve the situation. * Characters become feeble or genius level tactician and super slueth to fit the needs of the original author.	1
I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!	1
It's not what you'd imagine from a journey novel. Challenges are overcome less so with violence and more with good ol' trolling. Fun to read!	1
This is a wonderful translation of one of the Chinese classics. Don't be intimidated by the length, I never tired of the antics of the original Gang of 4. I felt like I had to pick this series up after seeing so many TV sets in Viet Nam with monkey and pig guys flying around on them, and I'm glad I did.	1
Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading.	1
This is the third volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, "The Journey to the West." The story continues to be fantastical, violent, and, despite its episodic nature, surprisingly compelling to me. I was reading the previous volume in parallel with Ken Liu's "The Wall of Storms." Once I started this third volume, I decided to shelve Ken Liu's book in favor of Tripitaka and Pilgrim's continuing adventures. For a Chinese classic published over four hundred years ago, the content is far less elevated and far more entertaining than I'd expected. Consider, for instance, this edifying quote, "Even a fart is additional air!" I am now impatiently waiting for Amazon to deliver the final volume.	1
Of course, this is Chinese culture. If you know Sun Wu Kong you know Chinese people. This edition is scholarly and brings the Jenner edition up to date.	1
great novel.	1
A great book. Ahead of its time.  Author did a magnificent job	1
A masterpiece	1
As expected	1
A book worth reading. Although reading the whole series in order is advisable. Enjoy the endless Wisdom offered	1
These books, all four are very good read. Very entertaining and kept me occupied for a long time. Written in very simple English.	1
excellent	1
I have reached, with sadness, the end of my journey through the four-volume, four-hundred-year-old Chinese classic, "The Journey to the West." I plodded through the lengthy but valuable introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu, then set off through the hundred fantastical chapters of the story.   It is not a journey for those who like their fiction in small doses. Nor does it fit the mold of most of the fantasy that I love. True, there are dragons and monsters and mythic battles, but of the two main characters, one is an ugly, ultra-violent, supernatural monkey, and the other is a timorous, puritanical monk. Moreover, the narration is less immersed in the characters' viewpoints than I usually prefer, partly because it frequently breaks into poetry. Perhaps the biggest departure from typical fantasy tomes is that the book is largely episodic. It journeys westward without much of a dramatic arc. While individual episodes have their battles and resolutions, the characters and the situation change slowly, sometimes imperceptibly.   Any or all of the above might have deterred me. Had I been in a more cantankerous mood, perhaps they would have done so. Yet they did not. By and large, I liked the digressions into poetry. I accepted the cowardice of one character, the violence of the other, the less-than-immersive narration, the episodic quality more common to television series than to novels. I liked the lightness of tone, the sense of fun. Most of all, I grew fond of the characters, as I think the author was fond of them. I wanted to spend time in their company, and am left now, at the end of the long journey, missing them.	1
I’m paraphrasing my husband in this review (or trying to). The Journey to the West was my birthday present to him — and he loved it. He read a couple of pages to me, and it put me to sleep. Reading the complete work is a labor of love for a scholarly person deeply interested in sixteenth-century Chinese culture and its integration of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. The four hefty volumes offer a mythological and allegorical version of Xuanzang’s journey to acquire scriptures in India. Ordeals along the way illustrate the stages of spiritual transformation. Xuanzang and his disciples are manifestations of the religious seeker. Dealing with the ordeals reads a bit like a detective story. Investigation reveals that the demons are often escapees from heaven. According to my husband, who read every word of the four volumes including the footnotes, the series is a fabulous exposition of Taoist internal alchemy and Chinese Buddhism.	1
And it was a "journey," the second longest I've taken but I am very glad to have read it.  Despite a lot of repetition this epic of Chinese literature held my interest through all four volumes and I think I learned a lot.	1
This is a translation of classic Chinese Buddhism tales.  The writing appears faithful the style of the Chinese stories and old styles of telling stories.  It is worth reading to get a better understanding of tales virtually every Chinese child learns at an early age.  The whole series helped me in my appreciation of Chinese culture.	1
Very readable translation. I don't know how accurate it is, the poetry seems to be almost too good, but I really enjoyed it. Those who are not familiar with this style might want to start with The Bandits of the Marsh or Romance of the Three Kingdoms before tackling the 4 volumes of the Journey to the West.	1
I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!	1
Fascinating look into the mythology of China.	1
Hey, this is the "Journey to the West". one of the best fantasy adventures of all times.  I wish I had read it as a child, or had it read to me. It was extremely fun and entertaining. This was the first time I had read the novel.  I had seen a few movies that lead up to or were a truncated version of the actual story.  Finally learning who the "Handsome Monkey King" was enlightening and aided my comprehension of a Taoist text I had read that discusses the "monkey mind" frequently.  While the acknowledged hero in the story is the Buddhist monk who is sent on the journey to the west to retrieve sutras from the Buddha, the real hero is Sun Wukong, the Handsome Monkey King!?! He's the wildest hero I've ever read about.  It takes a while to get the actual journey by all 4 pilgrims but I enjoyed reading how the Sun Wukong became the Monkey King and created such a ruckus in Heaven! Anyone who ever created a comic book or animated superhero must have read or heard of this story and used a variety of Sun Wukong's powers to create their hero.  this will be yet another novel that I'll read at least once per year.	1
Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading.	1
A masterpiece	1
As expected	1
This non abridged version is much more enjoyable than an abridged version I read previously.	1
Best book ever written ?	1
The Tang priest, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, along with their horse - a transformed river dragon - have to travel from the Tang court in China to the Western Heaven. Their mission: to retrieve the Scriptures from Buddha and deliver them to the Emperor. If they succeed, China will become a happy, prosperous place and the unjustly condemned souls will be rescued. But the journey is fraught with difficulties and deadly perils. In the end it takes 14 years; in the process the four pilgrims meld themselves into a potent, loyal team, win through dozens of unheard-of threats to life and limb, and achieve enlightenment. This is another long classic in the spirit of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" that goes on and on with twists and turns that take you by surprise, except for the fact - spoiler alert! - that you know that the four heroes must eventually win through, deliver the Scriptures, and achieve enlightenment. A lot of the Buddhist hierarchy shows up unbidden, or is called upon for help by Monkey as he solves problem after problem on the journey West, so it's an entertaining introduction to those folks. The tone is lighthearted; even the constant threats to the Tang priest's life, as monsters try to capture and eat him (thereby obtaining eternal life by consuming a piece of his pure flesh) have a funny side. A lot of humor is provided by the irreverent Monkey; he's incapable of very much humility and constantly violates social conventions, even in Heaven; but his heart is usually in the right place. His capabilities are vast, including being immortal and having the power to work all sorts of magic, but his hubris often leads him astray. This is pitched as a children's tale - although the occasional sex and almost constant fairy-tale violence might make it an older children's tale - and the characters reflect childish impulsiveness and disregard for ceremony. It's a fun read, and I was disappointed when it was over. I'd recommend it!	1
I currently own 3 different versions of "Journey to the West", and of the three, this one is probably the best compromise between detail and brevity. I am currently reading it to my 7-year-old (I read it by myself a while ago), and while the vocabulary is definitely a stretch (I have to explain 4 or 5 words on most pages), he's really loving it. The story has all the appeal of a Martial Arts novel, The Wizard of Oz, and a Buddhist philosophical treatise blended into a thoroughly entertaining tale for all ages. I previously read "Adventures of Monkey King" (ISBN 0962076511) to my son, and while the language was much more appropriate for a young child, the story was overly abridged, and a lot of the detail that makes the story fun and interesting was lost. This edition tells the beginning and the end of the story very well, but leaves out all of the middle episodes between finding the dragon horse, Pigsy, and Sandy and getting to the mountain of fire.  As a result, Pigsy and Sandy are a bit under-developed, but the Monkey King definitely gets a real chance to shine, and you do get a decent feel for Pigsy and Tripitaka, at least.  I kind of appreciate that they left the whole middle section out instead of picking random stories, because that makes it easier to go back to the full version of the story ("Journey to the West (4-Volume Boxed Set)", ISBN 7119016636), and fill in the missing stories if you want to. The way it's told here, the actual journey itself is the smallest part of the story.  It's all about setting up the characters and reaching Inda.  In the full-length version, the story is mostly about the journey, and how it changes the characters. This version is very good for those who want to get the flavor of the characters and "find out what happens", but the full version is best for those who really just want to enjoy reading about the Monkey King doing what he does best, and aren't anxious for it to end.  Be warned, though, the full version can drag a bit if you're hoping to actually see the plot move along. I have heard that the book "Monkey/Folk Novel of China" (ISBN 0802130860) best captures the comedic aspects of the story, so that will be my next purchase. The British (well, really, Chinese via Japan) TV series "Monkey" is also based on this story. I discovered that it has recently been released on DVD in Australia, and that a British release is coming that will include the 13 previously unaired Japanese episodes (with subtitles). As the series was never aired in America, I may need to buy a PAL DVD player to watch it, so that's what I plan to do. The story is that good.	1
The only book out of dozen different authored ones. Includes the story of the monkey from the beginning ( most books only start from the monk ) written in plain English as English books  [ translated or not ] should be { some books are written for and understood only by students and scholars }	1
Heavily shortened, it's alright overall but leaves a lot out.  Consider it a good primer for readers interested in the whole folklore of this legend, but there are better options out there.	1
The book is difficult for most Western readers, because some of the language is so fantastic in its description of all the different spirits, monsters, immortals, etc.  But just stick with it and by the end of the book you will have an increased understanding of the mythology that works its way into a lot of Chinese Cultural opionions. I initially started reading this, because it is one of what is touted as one of the essential Chinese classics, and also because my wife, who is Chinese, was born in the Monkey Year, and I was born in the Boar Year.  The 4 main characters of the novel are Monkey, Pig, Friar Sand and the brother of the Tang Emporer.  My former business partner is named Tang, so, for me the book was irresistable. But, as I said, the book is very long, and the variety of monsters, spirits, immortals, etc. is mind boggling, but somehow, at the end it makes a unified impression, and from reading all the different subplots, you gain an understanding of Chinese culture that simply cannot be gained without it. gjmugg	1
This translation skipped most of the adventures along the journey, which were the best part of this classic.	0
I have read the printed version of the "Journey to the West" before and thought it would be nice to have the eBook version for my Android.  It's like visiting old friends when I read about the Monkey King, Pigsy and the rest.  Plus, it's nice to be able to bring the book with me so I can read it when traveling or I have a few spare minutes. I believe eBooks are definitely the wave of the future and this one makes a nice addition to my electronic library. Thanks for reading. Brad	1
tame the ego and magic appears, there are peaceful solutions to anything.  A delightful read of wisdom.	1
a wonderfully written book and full of life lessons.	1
The Journey to the West is a classic and its great read. Classic Chinese literature is poetic with life lessons all in a great adventure tale. The scene descriptions are hyperbolic but should be read as a tale being told to an audience.	1
Real good book I'm keeping it in my libary for good	1
I had to read this book for an Asian religious studies class and it was by far one of my favorite readings from the class. I'm a slow reader but I managed to finish this in the course of just a few days. The plot and characters really pull you in and it's an easy read.	1
This is a solid translation of the work, however, there are many, many, embarrassing misspellings. For example, "you're" became "you've", "quite" became "quire", etc. While these do not generally impede your understanding of the book, it can be annoying. Also, as mentioned before in another review, the table of contents is useless, no hyperlinks, no chapter names.	1
It was probably the longest book I've ever read and I'm a voracious reader. Growing up in Chinese martial arts with a Taoist Si Fu and Buddhist Si Mu, learning forms named after Sun Wukong and Immortals, this book hit a sweet spot called home.	1
I tend to take forever finishing a book, but this was such an enjoyable read I couldn't put it down!	1
An interesting story, and is a must-read for anyone majoring in history. This is THE story of China blending their animism with Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism.	1
This was a book used by my history class, used to depict Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucianist ideals. This is a very fun read, the chapters just fly by.	1
I really enjoyed it, but there are too many long shots when nothing happens	1
one of four classics of ancient Chinese literature gives insight into the cultural outlook on self improvement with charm and humor	1
Amazing book! So glad I found it again.	1
A fantastic, epic tale. If you saw the TV show in the Eighties you'll love the book. It brings Monkey & all your favourites back to life.	1
Loved it. Highly suggest.	1
This book is remarkable, highly recommend	1
Great.	1
It is an amazing story with a lot of interesting characters not found in Western literature. If you want to understand Chinese religion, mainly Buddhism and Daoism, this is a good place to start.	1
Real nice, been looking for it for a long time	1
This book is one of the "4 classics" that Chinese children are studying during their school education. This one is probably too far from the Western cultural roots to make an easy reading, yet it is worth the patience (and sometimes the pain to go through some lengthy descriptions of places, costumes, characters...) for a Westerner seeking to better understand the Chinese psyche.	1
Brilliant, witty, touching, and ridiculous. I loved it. I'll read it again. The boring bits can be breezed through, all in all an amazing read	1
TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT...	1
This is a challenging book to review in that it is long, as are the other classic Chinese epics (Three Kingdoms, Outlaws of the Marsh and Dream of the Red Chamber) and accordingly contains much that will on the one hand provoke, entertain and inspire the modern reader while also containing much many are likely to find infuriating. The basic plot is simple and well-known (and easily researchable on Wikipedia and other web sites). An emperor of China's Tang dynasty, seeking enlightenment for his kingdom, appoints a monk to journey to the west (India) to worship the Buddha and bring back the scripture. The monk has four disciples (fallen beings who are being given a chance to redeem themselves) who help him. These are the Monkey King, the Pig, and Friar Sand, and the horse. Pig and Friar Sand were heavenly Generals who messed up and were put into the bodies of animals. The horse is a dragon who is working off a sin by being in the body of a horse. Monkey was born of stone and is redeeming himself after having caused considerable chaos in and even revolted against heaven, taking on everybody there including the Jade Emperor (a stand-in, it seems, for God). This is based on a true story wherein a Tang emperor really did send a monk on a mission to bring back Buddhist scripture, and also gather information (a Lewis & Clark type exploratory mission). It's a long trip accomplished on foot and for the monk, horseback (the main modes of transportation back then). The disciples can travel via cloud, but not the monk. But in the epic, the length of the trip is the least of the challenges. Again and again and again the party is beset by demons many of whom want to eat the monk's flesh in order to gain eternal life (something that is said to be possible given the monk's purity). Unlike other famous fictional voyagers, though, this monk couldn't fight his way out from under a grain of rice. He spends pretty much the entire epic weeping and complaining. It's mainly Monkey, helped more or less (emphasis on "less") by the other disciples, that constantly has to overcome the obstacles. The points of interest, the good parts, come from the nature of the adventures (quite varied and imaginative) and perhaps more important, the key relationships: between Monkey and the Monk, between Monkey and the assortment of deities, and between Monkey and the other disciples. The monk is the prototypical whiney nerd. As mentioned, his specialties are weeping and complaining. Moreover, he is fooled by more illusions than a ten-year-old at a cheap magic show; actually, he's fooled by all illusions. Monkey, on the other hand, is the one who "gets it." His ability to see what's real isn't quite 100%, but its close and even when he errs, he corrects himself very quickly. He is, perhaps, the single greatest, most skilled, and most powerful (lots of magic powers) sidekick in all of literature (East or West). So you'd think the Monk would revere and trust Monkey, right? Not so. The Monk does not trust Monkey at all and rejects his advice every time, until he gets into a mess and has no choice to do what Monkey demands in order to escape the crisis, only to distrust Monkey again next time. Twice in the epic, Monk gets so angry at what he perceives to be a bad attitude on the part of Monkey, he fires him (kicks him out of the expedition), but, of course, is force to be reconciled lest he wind up as dinner for a monster. But the Monk just doesn't learn. He continually trusts Pig, whose main concern is his own indulgence. As to capabilities, Pig is OK, but a distant second behind Monkey. I'm not sure why the author fusses about the horse and Friar Sand. Neither has any discernable personality and both seem to be there just to carry stuff. And this is where we begin to get into things that may annoy a modern Western reader. The practice of the art of fiction here is not what we're used to. The epic relies a lot, and I mean A HECK Of A LOT on a fictional technique known as "deus ex machina" which translates literally to "God out of the machine." It's well known in ancient Greek theater. The author sets up a fascinating plot conflict and then finds himself unable to logically solve it, so an actor playing one the Gods is lowered to the scene from a set of pulleys (the machine) to sort everything out. The Greeks get away with it because the conflict is usually more important than the details of how it's resolved, but even they don't completely escape criticism. In this epic, "deus ex machina" is used constantly. Like the Greeks, conflict and escape are paramount, but with the Greeks, you get one "deus ex machina" instance per play. Here, it bombards you again and again and again time after time after time in the same epic to the point where it becomes tempting to skip ahead once the conflict is established because you pretty much know what's coming. In fact, the adventures get so formulaic after a while, you may wonder if this is really a single epic, or something that was cobbled together from a lot of separate adventure stories. I have no idea what the answer is, but in the work handed down to us, the end implies it is a unified epic and that the crises were orchestrated from heaven to enable the Monk to become worthy of receiving the scriptures. But again, I can't swear this wasn't grafted on at a later time. One of the things that leads me to wonder about this being a unified epic is the way the Monk fails to even start to come to grips with Monkey's merits until the very end. To a modern Western reader, that defies belief, and having read other ancient Chinese epics, I'm not in a hurry to attribute such shallow characterization to the epic's different time and place. Also, the underdeveloped characterizations of Friar Sand and the horse lead me to wonder if they were developed in other segments of the story that got lost, or if the author intended to flash them out but never got around to it. It's important to note that my speculations as to whether this is a unified work or something that was patched together is just that, personal speculation. I have absolutely no clue about the facts and haven't (at least not yet) even checked to see if there's any research pointing one way or another. What I'm suggesting to you, as a reader of this review, is to draw conclusions about the fact that I am so wrapped up in speculations like this. That tells you a lot about how the work is organized, and how reading it feels as you get beyond the 22-chapters of introductory material. Clearly, though, the most intriguing character, and the one that makes the whole thing worthwhile is Monkey. His evolution from literature's most potent a**-hole to its most potent protector is riveting and addictive. It's a fascinating object lesson to anyone who has occasion to deal with difficult but talented people. The end of the story implies the monk needed to suffer to earn the right to get the scriptures. We modern folks, though, don't need to go through that. We can, if we wish, try to recognize the merit around us without constantly bringing ourselves to the brink of destruction.	1
Lost too much stuff including some most core stories. The pictures do not fit their descriptions. The worst version I have ever seen.	0
With the pandemic limiting bookstore browsing, I’m spending more time browsing my own bookshelves, pulling out books that I meant to read but forgot. I’m not sure exactly how Monkey: A Journey to the West, retold by David Kherdian, ended up amongst my other books, but I’m glad it did. Apparently, Monkey — a bit of Trickster, like Coyote from some Native American legends, only with a mean streak and a propensity for fighting and drinking and stealing and causing cosmic mayhem — is a folk story dating back to the sixteenth century. It’s an allegory of the struggle we must all face before a spiritual transformation is possible. Like most great spiritual journeys, Monkey is spurred by a desire to become immortal. Given that he was born from a magic stone “fructified by the seeds of Heaven and Earth, and by the essences of the sun and moon…” I think he might have been immortal to begin with, but that point is lost on Monkey. He sets out to learn all the secrets, which will lead to becoming immortal. Along the way he tangles with an incredible pantheon of gods, lesser and greater, and elders and spiritual leaders and demons and dragons. The list is so massive, and most of the cultural references were completely lost on me. I wish there was a cheat sheet of characters to provide context because the significance of the Moon Goddess and Jade Emperor and Dragon King of the Western Ocean was obscure. Still, the book was a joy to read and I really started to feel for Monkey, especially after he got a mountain dropped on him for 500 years. I only wish the religious texts of my youth, suffered in silent confusion on hard benches, had a fraction of the energy, passion and entertainment found in Monkey: “Furious, Natha cried, ‘Change!’ Whereupon he was transformed into a ferocious deity with three heads and six arms. His hands held six weapons: a monster-slashing sword, a monster-hacking scimitar, a monster-binding rope, a monster-quelling club, an embroidered ball, and a fire wheel. Brandishing these weapons, he charged Monkey.” “So you’ve a trick or two up your sleeve,” Monkey said. “Well, have a look at this!” Shouting “Change!” Monkey turned into a demon with three heads and six arms. His cudgel had become three cudgels, and grabbing each with two hands, he engaged Natha in an earth-shaking, mountain-trembling battle. They flew through the air like meteors and clashed like lightning, each parry and blow a thunderclap, with sparks flashing across the skies like shooting stars.” When I finished the book and was thinking through all the battles and shenanigans and cosmic forces, I thought, “This would make an epic Kung Fu movie, why hasn’t anyone thought of that?” They did. I checked. There are dozens of them. Looking forward to watching them all.	1
Although plot detail and events are skipped for brevity, Kherdian gives delightful dialog to his characters, especially the Monkey King (The Handsome Monkey King!).  A reader feels that he has probably met someone  this brash and outrageous in real life.  The plot moves quickly for lively reading.  It is more engrossing and even more exciting than recent film treatments of the story. A good introduction to Journey to the West, a Chinese classic novel.  Hopefully the reader will want to find out more about the story, and also Chinese culture .	1
Monkey was not exactly what I was expecting.  From the description, I thought this story would be heavily involved in Eastern Philosohpy, and use analogies to explain the Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucianist dogmas. Instead, the majority of the book describes the dozens of battles between monkey and various demons and spirits.  The specifics/tactics of these battles are described, including weapons (axes, swords, maces, monkey's cudgel, etc.), the magical transformations used (monkey growing to 10000 feet tall, or turning into a bird, etc.), and the status of the battle (300 rounds and no-one gaining an advantage, the opponents head being chopped off, etc.). Although there is some discussion of monkey's training in "The Way" (with some Taoist and Confucianist ideas), and some of the Buddhist theories (right action, non-violence), the story is more focused on the adventures and battles of monkey and his master, who is searching for Buddhist scrolls.	1
This is one of my favorite books that I will very seldom recommend to people. The reason for this is that while I found the long tangents, odd storylines, quirky characters, and great length of the book to be fantastically entertaining, I recognize that it is a very peculiar combination of elements that might not sit well with some. The book can also be somewhat repetitive on a superficial level, though there was enough variance in each story to keep me interested. The book also can be rather long-winded at times, but it's often in a funny way.	1
This is a decent telling of the Chinese story, but it doesn't deliver on its own promises: Kherdian says that he includes more episodes and more of the spiritual aspects of the story than are found in the famous Arthur Waley version, but sadly, he does no such thing (especially in a crucial and famous scene toward the end). Kherdian's version is certainly readable and enjoyable, but Waley's is more thorough and includes more of the religious elements of the original. However, Kherdian's version may be better for younger readers than Waley's as, of the two abridgements, it is the easier to read.	1
I just love the TV series monkey and the book is just as interesting. I found a really old copy at a junk sale. Before that I had no idea of the origin of the series. I just thought is was an amusing variation on samurai, ninja type themes. The original text is, however, the reason for the depth of philosophical thought which the series contains. I have no idea whether the philosophy goes into kids heads, or straight over them, but they seem to love it and the book makes great bedtime reading for children who love the series.	1
Monkey King is one of the 4 top classics in Chinese literature. All my friends in Beijing told me I should read it first of the 4, and they chose well. Akin to the Wizard of Oz in America, the story has many layers of meaning, and provides significant insight into Chinese culture and thought patterns, past and present. The story is easy to pick up and follow in episodes. I will confess that I skipped over some of the flowery (and lengthy) descriptive poetic sections, but this is a good read. This edition is marred by having no good navigation system, and by  occasionalrandom misspellings (due to the linguistic mindset of the Chinese translator/s).	1
This translation of the classic Chinese novel is not nearly as good as the previous Arthur Waley edition, also available from Amazon.  This edition has the advantage of being greatly simplified, and therefore may be more suitable for young readers.  Fans of the Waley edition might also be interested in this edition as a source for a few slightly different stories selected from the much longer original.  However, this edition eliminates much of the texture of the original and is overall much, much shorter than Waley's.  Most readers would be far wiser to choose Waley's classic edition.  This is a poor substitute at best, except possibly for children.	0
While this is the only version of the Monkey King story that I have read, I have read other Eastern philosophy stories, and I have to say that this version is definitely the most readable of all of them. That being said, I did find the story to be a little light on the Eastern wisdom it was meant to deliver. However, if you're looking for a fun story based on some Eastern principles to read to your children, this could be it.	1
If  you are a huge fan of the Journey to the West do not purchase this abridgement, buy the whole 3-4 volume set also available on Amazon.  Otherwise the translation and abridgement here is fine for a quick, fun read.	1
This book is fantastic, It's a great read but thats just me because I love Asian myth's and things of the sort. But few know that this book is the basis of the incredibley popular anime Dragon Ball Z. Yes thats right, im not making this up this is 100% true. If you look up the story for dragon ball, the first in the series of dbz, you will find that it is incredibley similar to this book. Monkey represents Son Gokou, the pig represents oolong, the great king of the mountain is ox king. If you are a big time DBZ fan like me, read this book and find out the origin.	1
I waiting a long time to read this book imswr very interested in Chinese mythology so far I have enjoyed the story..thank you Amazon for your prompt service I also have a kindle fire wihich I also enjoy very much!!!!	1
I downloaded the sample for this and found the TOC worthless. Chapter 1 to Chapter 100 are listed. But they aren't even hyperlinked. Any other decent sample book I've tried has a hyperlinked TOC. I deleted it then and there. Found a free copy elsewhere on the web with hyperlinks and even quick chapter summaries. That one's a keeper.	0
I really loved this book, it passed the time really fast and I liked the book so much I finished it in only 10 hours.	1
I have loved Monkey King since I was a little lad waiting for it to come on the tv, so I decided to read the actual book and events and I have enjoyed every single page so far. Sometimes a little hard to grasp but I get there eventually. well worth it for any Far East lover or Monkey fan.	1
Very rarely does a story jump out of the book and strike you square in the imagination with such impact as Wu Cheng'en Journey to the West. It not only is a tale of monsters, demons and devils, it also sends the message of peace and tolerance in the form of the Buddhist monk Sanzang (known better in the West as Tripitaka) set in a time of great upheaval, not only in China but throughout the world. It is a mix of established Chinese mythology and beliefs, combined with historical events and the creative genius of Wu Cheng'en. I have read this book many times by many different translators and it never fails to please. Do yourself a favour and buy this book.	1
An excellent read I highly recommend this book.excellent service by the supplier.10/10	1
Very interesting thanks JNR	1
Wonderful story, although it does seem to suffer from a few OCR faults, but those are of a minor nature and don't affect the readability of the book.	1
First experienced this through the animation adaptation of Dragonball.  Reading through this has been one of the best reading experiences I have had the pleasure of encountering; I would highly recommend this to anybody and everybody.	1
This Kindle version ( Monkey - Journey to the West ) appears to be the entire unabridged version of the story.  I also have the printed unabridged version which consists of 4 volumes totaling 2317 pages ( Journey to the West ).  I compared the entire first chapter of this Kindle version with the aforementioned printed version, and it's the same word-for-word.  I point this out as there are a few abridged versions available. So, the story.  It dates back from the Ming Dynasty, somewhere around the 1500's and was, I believe, initially produced in installments.  For those of you familiar with the Japanese TV series "Monkey", you will recognize the characters in the book.  The first part of the book focuses on Monkey, his birth, his ascension to the King of the Monkeys, his going to, and subsequent dismissal from Heaven.  The next part of the book introduces the rest of the team (Triptaka, Sandy, Pigsy and the Horse.  Then the book goes into the adventures the team have as chronicled in the aforementioned TV series. The formatting of the Kindle version is very good and I have yet to find any of the infamous typos and poor format found in some Kindle books.  The formatting is not as good as the print version (the chapter sub-headings appear to be continuous with the text of the book) but then again, you can't really expect it to. So, all-in-all, I am delighted with this purchase, and I would recommend this version to fans of the TV series who want to learn more about Monkey and who enjoy a good read.	1
Ich wollte die Reise nach Westen schon lange lesen und habe es mit einer Adaption der WJF Jenner Übersetzung (Beijing, 1955) versucht. Die war so abschreckend umfangreich und detailiert (weit über 1000 Seiten!) und unverständlich geschrieben, dass ich es nach nichtmal 5 Seiten aufgegeben habe und mich jahrelang nicht mehr an die Geschichte herangetraut habe. Dann bin ich, quasi zufällig, auf die Adaptionen von Shambhala Classics gestoßen und wollte es doch noch mal mit der Reise nach Westen versuchen. Diese Fassung der Geschichte war flink weggelesen. Verständlich geschrieben, aber stark gekürzt. Ein bisschen zu stark für meinen Geschmack. Oft hatte ich das Gefühl, Sachverhalte oder Beschreibungen nur sehr skizzenahft übermittelt zu bekommen. Ebenso fehlt jegliche Poesie, die in der Vorlage ja eine große Rolle spielt. Aber naja, um einen Einblick in die Geschichte zu bekommen, reicht es. Man hat sie gelesen, man kann mitreden (als ob ein Gespräch jemals wirklich das Buch thematisieren würde...) Mir als unkonzentrierten Leser kam es ja auch i-wo entgegen. Inhaltlich kann ich nur sagen, dass Handsome Monkey King aka Great Sage, Equal of Heaven echt nen verdammtes A****loch ist. Ich meine, dass er nicht gerade ein moralisches Vorbild ist, war mir schon klar, aber wow. Selten so einen nicht-mögenswerten Protagonisten erlebt.	1
Wunderschön geschrieben, leicht verständliches und bilderreiches english. Dieses Buch überzeugt durch seine Gabe, den Leser zu fesseln und schafft es, selbst bei weniger als 210 Seiten, die Charaktere lieb zu gewinnen zu lassen und einen gewogenen Werdegang, sowie die Spannung zu erhalten. Gute, nicht allzu anspruchsvolle Kost, aber english Klasse 10> sollte es schon sein, sonst entziehen sich einem  so manche Eindrücke und bildliche Ebenen, die doch die eigentlichen inneren Bilder erst schaffen.	1
It's hard to know how to review this one. It does indeed appear to be the Unabridged edition of Journey to the West translated by W.J.F. Jenner, which is in copyright and published by Foreign Language Press in four volumes. This edition certainly has some errors of the kind consistent with OCR and suffers from poor formatting and a lack of a table of contents - which for a work of this size is badly needed. It also lacks any copyright information, failing even to credit the translator, and doesn't include the extensive introduction of the FLP edition. It is published by an unknown publisher called Monkey King. So, you can draw your own conclusions and for myself, I suggest instead that you buy the FLP edition here: Journey to the West	0
中国四大奇書でありながら、日本人には本だけでなくドラマ、パペットなどさまざまなイメージを与えてきた西遊記ですが、この西遊記は金閣・銀閣をはじめとするいわゆる妖怪退治を筋にした西遊記とは一味違います。 前半は孫悟空のルーツについてのストーリーが中心。道を阻む妖怪とのふれあいを描いたストーリーも面白いですが、本来の「不躾で自信過剰なやんちゃ猿」の心の成長に重きを置いたこの本は、読者の西遊記へのイメージをより濃いものにしてくれます。 この物語が好きで、いろいろな出版社から出されている日本語のものを読み比べている人も多いと思いますが、西遊記が好きな人には、挿絵も含めて今までの中国的な味わいにエキゾチックなイメージを与えてくれるという点で面白く読める一冊。<!BR!>ただ、「大冒険」に西遊記の魅力を感じている人にはちょっと物足りないかもしれません。	1
I'm a Chinese speaker, but my daughter isn't. She has heard about the monkey king from us and was interested in hearing the story, so we ordered this book. The translation is slightly awkward, especially the inconsistent translation of names (some are translated by meaning, such as "Piggy" and some are phonetic translations of the Chinese name, such as "Xuan Zeng"). I find myself frequently making changes to the translation or adding explanations to make it more understandable or interesting to my daughter. That being said, I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be to translate this particular story into English and abridge it for young readers, so I'm not sure if there are much better versions out there or not.	1
Long ago I saw on TV a Chinese series on this story, without subtitles, so I was looking for an English version to read.  This gave me the basic story line, but is definately for beginning readers.  Has a shortened story line with a play version included and a vocabulary section for the meanings of the words.  Great for teaching purposes for 1st through 3rd graders.	1
Enjoyed.	1
The quality of the book is very good, the content translation is very good, and the mailing is very smooth.	1
I became interested in this book after watching Forbidden Kingdom. The story of the Monkey King is thoughtful and entertaining.  The Kindle edition was a no brainer at 99 cents.  The translation is fantastic and it reads like it was written with English being its original language.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in the Monkey King, and/or Asian history.	1
Journey to the West has truly stood the test of time. A fun read hundreds of years after it was written.	1
Love this book so much, I bought it for my children as I absolutely love everything journey to the west since growing up loving the TV show monkey. The pictures are great and the story well put together. Love this thank you	1
Wasnt what i expected too childish	0
I gave it as a gift.	1
Beautifully printed, plain language and images to foreign readers to understand the "Journey to the West" story.	1
The Journey to the West is one of the Four Great works of Chinese literature.  Kathryn Lin retells this story in a format accessible to young, and very young children.  Each of the 37 pages of this book is richly illustrated with numerous, bright, eye-catching watercolors and drawings.  Although this is not a bilingual book, for  parents wishing to expose their children to Chinese language or culture at an early age, the author intersperses common Chinese characters (along with pronunciation and a concise definition). The character of the Monkey King is reminiscent of Curious George. Or, one could say Curious George is reminiscent of the Monkey King.  I highly recommend this book to parents who want to familiarize  their children to another culture, especially those with children who already have an interest in Sagwa, Mulan, or other Chinese-themed children’s books.	1
Amazingly well done and beautiful art. Great intro book for little ones to learn about the monkey king and his story	1
Really cute book and easy to read. Pictures are watercolor and nicely done, bright. The length of it was also enough to be a good story time book. Good addtion for a child's library. Would recommend.	1
What more could you ask for in a children's book? The beautiful illustrations will charm young children and parents alike. Lin brings the Monkey King to life, making him into a spunky, funny and lovable protagonist. Lin writes a Chinese story for a Western audience, providing parents the perfect opportunity to expose their children to a culture different from their own. How clever of Lin to write this story! Bravo.	1
Like the author, I also grew up with stories of the Monkey King, Wukong.  This is a great re-telling of story.  I love the illustrations!  I am buying a copy for my nephew.	1
Love the book! The story is interesting and fun. I bought one for my niece as her birthday gift. She really enjoys the story and learns Chinese words. Highly recommended!	1
Now for the diatribe.  This is the 2nd translation I have read. For the westerner all the Chinese names can get confusing. One approach is to imagine an Asian coming to America and all your friends names are Smith, Jones, and Williams. At least I know quite a few, and they are NOT related. This translation actually has an appendix in the 2nd volume that lists all the names. REALLY HELPFUL!   Personally, I started reading the 1st translation I have, (in four volumes "not for sale in the USA") as the tv series, Game of Thrones got into it's 2nd season. My friends, who I watch it with are fanatics about the series. makes sense it has been the #1 TV show, several years running. For me, the Three Kingdoms has been much more enjoyable. Sometimes history is just better than the the most creative fiction. Now, this is a romanticized version of a piece of early Chinese history almost 2000 years ago. Every so often, I have to remind myself that this stuff essentially did happen. There is one scene, (an event in actual history) regarding some actions by Cao Cao that is, well, still talked about today in China, and a very dark stain to Chinese history. (OK, so there are some serious stains in Scottish and western history..)   As a westerner, I have to keep reminding myself that so much of what I am reading did actually happen. Even when I step away and remind myself that the author himself, (or whom this writing is  accredited to), lived centuries later. Well, the authors time is STILL over 1,000 years ago! Step away from Games of Thrones, or better, since the series has to wait for the author to catch up, use that break and read this series. Don't worry if all the names and locations appear confusing. Just read it. I read half of it over two days non-stop. (fortunately it was the weekend) and I am NOT a bookworm. It is hard to get me to sit down and read something. Perhaps I am praising this work too much... However, I really feel that this story is one that every westerner in the 21st century should read. It will not explain China or even Asian culture today. As it is considered one of the "5 classics" in Asian culture. It is Camelot on steroids. It almost puts the American Civil War to sleep, and as a proud American, I wish the story of our founding fathers could be half as exciting. Have fun and good luck!  Don't try to read it on the bus! or during your lunch break. You might get fired for no showing up to work..	1
Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences: "Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been." Compare this with Taylor's translation: "Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity." Or Hegel's: "Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce." It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator. [This review is a duplicate of the one I submitted for volume 1]	1
Good book. Accurately described.	1
Thank you.	1
I first encountered Moss Roberts' translation in a greatly abridged version which I took with me on my first trip to China.  It greatly increased my enjoyment of the trip.  Now Dr. Roberts has completed his translation of the whole novel.  It is much more readable than the only other complete translation in English, that of Brewitt-Taylor.  Many centuries of Chinese have used this book to gain wisdom about politics and war; I highly recommend that you take a look.	1
A True classic	1
Timeless classic.  Very nice paper binding!	1
Its like lord of the rings but Asian you should play dynasty warriors 8 and watch redcliff to get a feel for it or even read toilkens books to get you in the mood	1
Well written.	1
Great package, with protection. I receive it in a week. Take care about additionnal cost for TVA of your own country Nothing to say, good job	1
As a kid, one of my favorite video games was ' ' on the NES.  I played that game until TWO cartridges died from usage.  Later, on Playstation, I found ' ' and noticed a lot of similar names.  I played it and it was FANTASTIC.  I thought I was fulfilled in my living of Chinese myth/history until my mother bought me this four volume set for Christmas.  I was dumbfounded and immediately tore the plastic wrapping off and started reading.  They were all there.  All my favorite characters in my favorite games were all there and now, they had depth, they were people on the page in print living out the digital approximations I had loved so much.  Watching the formation of the Kingdom of Shu lead by the virtuous Liu Bei and Guan Yu with insurmountable strategist Zhuge Liang as the Prime Minister; seeing the power-hungry Cao Cao usurping the Han Emperor's throne; the brilliant but always foiled plans of Zhou Yu to kill Zhuge Liang; this wonderful story woven through each volume is PURELY RIVETING!  Play the games!  Buy the books! Live the adventure!	1
I was at home, with two cars in the drive, delivery instructions clearly stated if not at home leave in rear porch. The driver went to the rear porch which has a closed but unlocked door but rather than place them inside the porch he took the lazy option and placed the package on the 'Milk Box' to the right of the porch door. It should be noted that the goods which were in Amazon eminently recyclable but soluble packaging , it was pouring with rain and the packet contained expensive text books. Had they not have been urgently required for an academic thesis I would have returned them. However the need was great and half an hour of careful application of a hair-dryer  allowed  the pages of the uppermost volume to to separate and thus be read. Amazon is a convenient way to buy textbooks and other goods but the regularity of of crass stupidly by couriers who leave expensive items on the front doorstep and so visible from an adjacent footpath, solid state electronics left exposed to the elements  and even albeit boxed  jewelry resting against some outer door. Risky, inconsiderate, and positively the act of the indolent and those who speed rather than adhering to the instructions recorded against the delivery advice E-Mail..	1
A long read but possibly he best and most engrossing book I've ever read.  A massive cast of characters (fortunately there's a list of characters to refer to at the back of the book).  Footnotes help with the context but are out of the body of the text so don't interfere with the flow of the story.  The writing style of the translator makes the book very readable and it cracks along at a fair pace	1
great condtion excellent service & a really good read	1
I highly recommend this outstanding two volume set, to anyone interested in the classic literature of China. Terrific in terms of both content and shelf appeal, it's a must have for avid readers of great works.	1
5 stars!	1
This item arrived quickly and in good condition.  I hope I have purchased that right Part 1 as there were more than one book with the same title but nothing to indicate which book comes with.	1
Super interesting book! I read it twice	1
At $1.99, with enabled table of contents, excellent value. There are no notes nor explanatory matter. If the great number of characters is confusing you can find maps, relationship charts, and other resources at the 3Kingdoms Podcast site.	1
Great story. Well made book. Fast shipping. The print is tiny to the point of being too hard for these old eyes to read. Invest the extra money for a legible print size	1
What else can I say?	1
good read	1
Excellent book about the Romance warring era. Just wish the print was a little bigger. Tons of characters to keep track of too.	1
This edition of the Chinese classic has print that's unreadably tiny.  The print margins are nearly non-existent and the print's uneven on the pages.  I had to send it back.	0
One word "Epic"	1
Exactly what i expected and arrived early.	1
Print size so small it gave me a headache. I'm talking pocket bible size font...beware.	0
A lot of life lessons can be learned with an open mind.	1
Awesome read, a little slow in its pacing but what do you expect? The material predates us all.	1
The problem I'm having is distinguishing numerous characters from the locales mentioned.  There is very little basis to differentiate people from places as the names are so similar in spelling and the characters are many....	1
Probably very interesting but I could not handle the huge number of names that came up.  Very difficult to keep track of who's doing what.	0
Translation: Brewitt-Taylor, 120 chapters, 596186 words (Suggestions for more enjoyable reading are at the bottom of his review.) I’ve yet to run across another book that has done a better job of integrating combat action, strategy, tactics and politics.  In spite of its length I never got tired of reading it.  It leaves an impression the further you read—as I progressed through the book I noticed that I began to think more strategically--like a chess player. This is a historical novel, not an authoritative history text.  The history text of this period was RECORDS OF THE THREE KINGDOMS and like many works of fiction based on history, many parts of the ROMANCE can only have been speculation.  Also, skeptics might be unimpressed by the accounts of the supernatural (visions, omens, prophetic dreams (some of them horrible nightmares), miracles, ghosts, etc.) But the ROMANCE stands on its own as a work of fiction.  And not only do the supernatural events add a dash of spice, they’re also important in illuminating what’s going on underneath the worldly events.  For example, the fantastic account of Daoist magician, Zuo Ci, is probably as close to a peyote vision as most of us will ever get.  But it also presents us the enigma of powerful men.  Cao Cao was a great military leader and political ruler, but Zuo Ci offers him a chance to become a god.  You would think that godhood would be irresistable, but Cao Cao can’t give up his earthly power and his yearning to defeat and dominate other mortals.  In spite of that, powerful men are also hungry for supernatural powers.  They need to see the future and science only takes them so far.  They also have to dabble in religious thinking because everyone down to the humblest peasant takes the mandate of heaven very seriously.  It’s so serious that it starts a civil war in China, possibly the hardest country in the ancient world in which to wage a civil war due to its massive geographic size. This is also the story of effective military leaders and advanced military technology in the ancient world.  There were great strategists and generals like Cao Cao, Jia Xu, Xu Huang, Cheng Yu, Guo Jia, Lu Xun, Sima Yi, Deng Ai and especially Zhuge Liang.  I wish that more of the tactics that were mentioned had been fully described, but there were plenty of details.  For example, The Shu army suffered a major setback because of one bad gully.  Combats involved not only swordsmen but also messengers, logistics, engineers (tunnels, fortifications, moats, mounds, catapults), archers, incendiaries and riverine warfare.  Zhuge Liang even invented some kind of supply railroad, disguised as livestock.  Even tribesmen had metallic carriages.  This is one of the best novels I’ve ever read. 4.6 stars Suggestions for more enjoyable reading: 1. The first third of the book is essentially background. The story of how the Han dynasty became three separate kingdoms will be told here. The problem for you if you’re a Westerner (like me) is that it is chock full of Chinese names. In the course of the book you’ll become familiar with Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Cao Cao, Sun Quan, Sima Yi and Zhuge Liang. You might want to be aware of great generals and strategists like Cheng Yu, Guo Jia, Jia Xu, Lu Xun and and Xu Huang. But there are hundreds more and they’re not always easy to remember. Therefore, make a “cheat sheet” with what I would consider to be the most important names along with a small bit of biographical information on each.  (Try to limit this information to their rank, skill and who they served--You want to avoid including spoiler data.)  Do this for the names I’ve already mention and add Chen Gong, Cheng Pu, Ding Yuan, Dong Zhuo, Fan Chou, Guo Si, He Jin, Huangfu Song, Jian Shuo, Li Jue, Li Su, Lu Bu, Lu Zhi, Ma Teng, Tao Qian, Wang Lang, Wang Yun, Xun Yu, Yuan Shao, Zhang Ji, Zhang Yang, Zhou Yu and Zhu Jun. You should be able to ignore the rest.  The good news is that, after the background is covered, there won’t be many more names to remember. 2. You’ll enjoy the book much more if you have a set of good maps.  If your edition of the book lacks maps, you can find decent maps on the internet.  I found two or three maps that were useful.  I found the most useful map by googling “Map of the Three Kingdoms” and then downloading the map with the white land mass with the word “WEI” in blue, “SHU” in red and “WU” in green.  The problem is that this map is huge.  What I did was to use my graphics software to cut this map into smaller pieces.  The best idea is to cut them centering on the borders of the kingdoms because that’s where the battles will be.  I printed the JPG as a PDF document.  Then I found an online utility that converted PDF to MOBI format and put the maps on my Kindle (or did I just put the PDF on the Kindle?  Try both to see which works).  It was a bit of a pain to keep leaving the book to look at the maps, but at least I had some sense of where these guys were fighting.	1
If one likes reading the bible and who begets who, this is the book for you. Boring, boring, boring. It is by far the worse book I have ordered from Amazon ever.	0
This is a must read book for anybody who enjoys historical novels and for people who love strategy and battles.	1
I can't finish all my compliment for this book in this short review. You are not gonna believe it is such a splendid book until you read it yourself. This book is a saga with so much wisdom and humanity. It is as good as ancient Greek epic (with all repect to Greek) if not better. The wisdom in it is uncommonly plentiful. Trojan horse looks children's game after you finished the book. Romance of three kingdoms is a part of Chinese lives and now becoming popular in the world. Many Japanese companies make this book as a must-read for management staff. Read this book and I garantee that your time will be delightfully spent.	1
boring boring	0
Massive book. Quite hard to handle. Not for the faint-hearted.	1
A very precise translation of this book. Excellent for students.	1
Eu comprei esse livro depois de ver um vídeo na internet sobre o período dos Três Reinos na China. Foi uma compra meio impulsiva, mas o preço estava tão bom que decidi tentar. E não me arrependo de nada. O livro é um relato altamente ficcionalizado do período (em outras palavras, não leia como um livro de história muito seriamente), mas os personagens, o enredo não devem em nada para uma obra similar de hoje como Game of Thrones (e, honestamente, enquanto eu não consegui passar do primeiro capítulo de GoT, eu li até o final desse livro). O que mais me impressionou foram os personagens: você é capaz de ver personagens tão humanizados, é incrível um autor do século XIV entende muito melhor disso do que vários autores modernos. O que é divertido é ver planos se empilhando sobre planos e dá para criar momentos de imprevisibilidade. Também se adiciona o fato que o livro tem uma aplicação dos princípios de estratégia chinesa (por exemplo, generais que estudaram bastante A Arte da Guerra, mas não sabem improvisar, são considerados ruins). O livro é longo, mas os capítulos têm um tamanho muito bom para a leitura, lendo um capítulo por dia, tipo, antes de dormir, dá para ler o livro inteiro em menos de meio ano (se os ganchos permitirem, porque todo capítulo tem um gancho para o próximo). A tradução é uma versão antiga, de domínio público, mas que deve dar para o gasto, apesar de alguns problemas (além do mais, a presença de arcaísmos ajuda no clima do livro).	1
+4 pour le produit en lui même : c'est une belle collection. le papier est fin et agréable au toucher , de bonne qualité, solide. Le texte est propre et de jolie police, la traduction parfaite. petit plus : c'est une traduction chinois ( partie gauche) et francaise ( partie droite) , qui plaira aux érudits ou à ceux qui parlent - ou s'entraine à parler - les deux langues. -1 pour la livraison : ne pas mettre de protection anti-choc autour  des livres a provoqué un plis visible sur la première centaine de pages du premier tome, surement pendant la livraison. Je ne le renvois pas, mais j'aurai pu. Je conseille cet achat.	1
No complaints nor issues.  Arrived on time, and as described. I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend to others.	1
Letters too small, and poorly laid out.	0
excellent thanks	1
A must have classic	1
If you are going to start reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms then you should start with this book series. This edition is more coherent and well put together with footnotes at the bottom and end of each chapter. There is a character list in the beginning with brief descriptions. The names and places are spelled/pronounced more accurately. This series is a MUST for any fan of classical literature.	1
Best translation that I have of the series. I have 4 different ones. Very happy with this book.	1
Wow.. never thought i would finish these 3 novels. The vastness of the stories explain much of china today; its people, culture and even its politics. Very excellent translation.. bravo	1
It makes the great classic available to readers who are more comfortable witj English, yet retains the feel of the original language. This is especially evident in the translated poems.	1
My 15-year old LOVES this book. He's read it twice already.	1
It's great as long you don't steal it!	1
Vol. 3 provides an exciting conclusion to the preceding volumes. In Volumes 1 and 2, Zhuge Liang has masterminded, with clever maneuvers, victory at the Battle of Red Cliff against Cao Coa and then gone on to capture important cities, thus vastly increasing Liu Bei’s military power with additional soldiers and control of wealthy cities and provinces. Liu Bei dies in Vol. 3 leaving control of his kingdom to his son Liu Shan. Cao Cao, seeks to take advantage of Liu Bei’s death and inexperience of Liu Shan. Cao Cao comes up with a cunning scheme to attack Liu Shan’s kingdom from five directions. I was anxious to read how Zhuge Liang was going to deal with this new threat. However he reclused himself in his hut and would not come out. Finally after 3 days, Liu Shan goes to Zhuge Liang’s hut to hear what plans he has in mind. Zhuge Liang has brilliant plans to thwart each of the five attacks. He will himself lead the attack again the fierce Man tribes. In his fight against the Mans, after the battle he releases their leader on the faith of his good word that they will not fight again. This happens six times that Zhuge Liang battles and has victory over the Mans, each time capturing the leader and releasing him. After the seventh time, Zhuge Liang refuses to even see the leader of the Mans and has his assistant release him. At this, the leader of the Mans was so humiliated that he agreed to have a peace alliance with Liu Shan and have peaceful cooperation in the future. The Three Kingdoms story is truly one of the great classics of literature. This translation is easy reading. The footnotes were not only helpful, but at those special key locations in the writing, the footnotes at the bottom of the page made the flow of the story more meaningful.	1
Excellent books to read	1
This review is really for all three of the books, as I have read them in their entirety. Collectively, these can be a difficult read from the perspective of so many historical figures coming and going, particularly later on in the series.  I have pretty extensive knowledge of this era of history, so it was fine with me, but just a note for anyone who knows little about people of this time that your head might spin a bit with so many character introductions. In terms of the story itself, Vol 1 and 2 are wonderful, full of action and intruigue.  Vol 3... while historically what it was, I found arduous to read through.  This isn't the fault of the authors, nor the translation, it's just not very interesting in terms of what happened near the end of the period especially in comparison to they first two volumes.  The figures of the later part of this time just feel flat as compared to their predecessors. There are some editing errors, typos, etc. and some odd word choices considering the context (hubbub, seriously? And siesta, I laughed when I read this used.) So, I definitely recommend it with the caveats in mind.	1
good	1
This is a highly disappointing book.	0
(NOTE: This is a review for all three volumes of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms) I had been aware of this epic of Chinese literature for many years, but first developed a serious interest in reading it after having watched the excellent Chinese drama adaptation made in 2010. That gave me the impetus to pick up the first volume and give it a go. Some words of caution first, from one who has now read all three volumes. This is a book that very much requires you to juggle hundreds of names in your head and keep track of who is who. Indeed, I would strongly recommend watching that aforementioned TV series prior to reading the books. This may sound the wrong way around, but having made my way through all 1,377 pages, it would have been considerably harder without some pre-knowledge of key characters to anchor my progress. Having some understanding, for example, that a Lu Su matters where a Lu Xun does not, certainly makes getting through the book a mite less daunting. Another warning for those considering embarking on the Three Kingdoms: if you are not interested in military strategy and take no pleasure in reading about the minutiae of war, you should probably turn away. A significant percentage of the book is spent on detailing battles: many, many battles, often in quick succession. While war itself is not the core of what the Three Kingdoms is about, it is nevertheless the medium through which many of the story's messages are related. This is a fictionalised account of a very real historic period in Chinese history. After the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 AD, the country fell into a state of civil war, as rival warlords fought one another for superiority - each claiming to be the rightful successor to Han. Gradually power consolidated around three separate kingdoms: Wei in the North, Wu in the South and Shu in the West. Each was led by its own charismatic leader - Cao Cao, Sun Quan and Liu Bei respectively. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms tells their story, how they rose to power, what they did with that power and how each, ultimately, fell. It is truly epic in its scale, and widely recognised in China as one of the greatest books ever written. For me, this book is about much more than just a historic narrative. Still less is it a book merely about military tactics - although they certainly feature prominently throughout. Rather, the Three Kingdoms represents an insightful, penetrating look at power - how it can be won, how it can be maintained and how it can be lost. Each of the three rulers demonstrates different virtues and flaws, and is aided by a wide variety of generals and advisers, each with their own agendas. The ruthlessness of Cao Cao is tempered by his intellectual brilliance and his ability to exercise power without ever openly admitting to it. The virtue of Liu Bei, meanwhile, is undone by his inability to win his own battles and by his undying loyalty to those who do not always serve him best. The astuteness of Sun Quan is highlighted by the way in which he employs people best suited to the role, implicitly acknowledging his own shortcomings. Each ruler has a coterie of advisers, and the relationship between power and those who would shape and direct that power is fascinating. Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi both stand out as impressive figures in their own right, often outshining the men they exist to serve. Their interplay, in particular, is a highlight of the book. And it would be remiss of me not to mention Liu Bei's two brothers-in-arms: Zhang Fei, the oft-drunk and irascible warrior and Guan Yu, the legendary fighter who keeps his honour to his very last breath. Another lesson the Three Kingdoms teaches is that for all the struggles and grand designs, winning or losing may very often lie in the lap of the gods. A rainstorm at the wrong moment or a change in the direction of the wind can make all the difference. Illnesses strike down otherwise undefeated veterans, just as ultimately the collapse of the three kingdoms ends up owing more to the dissipation and idleness of the rulers' successors than to any great military victory. Power is ephemeral, and it cannot ever be taken for granted. There are so many stories and sub-plots woven into the fabric of the Three Kingdoms that it would be both infeasible and futile to assess them all here. The best I can say of this book is that it is a joy to read and its many pages a wonderful place within which to lose yourself. It is long, and there will be times when you may wonder if the battles will ever end with one siding achieving anything close to a significant victory; but stick with it and you will be rewarded.	1
I really enjoy this book; although, I have a little trouble with the translations, I find myself re-reading some sentences. But it's a great read for history buffs and fans of the Dynasty Warriors games.	1
I think this is the third different Three Kingdoms version that I buy on Amazon and I really like it. The novel is awesome! (just check wikipedia for the plot), and the pinyin names help a lot the Dynasty Warriors fans like me.	1
I don't know who is to blame for this unreadable mess, but... DANG!	0
One of the four classic books of Chinese literature. An epic journey to an age of heroes, I really enjoyed this book, even if the maps are not the best ones...	1
Not a review of the book but rather a review of this edition. It is filled with grammatical errors and typos. Awful and unreadable and I'm really disappointed that I both the entire set of the books since they seem so poorly done. I read 5 pages before giving up. Almost unreadable if you care about grammar at all -- there was an error in the first sentence "domains tends to unite."	0
This version is horrible. The translator paraphrases so liberally that it actually takes away from the story. Other reviews mentioned that there are tons of grammatical errors and they were correct. These two facts make it a pain to read - not to mention the size of the books - they are heavy and huge - and mine had almost 3" margins along the pages, with text on about 2/3 of each page. This made the book unwieldy. I would say Moss Roberts' version is far superior in every aspect.	0
The book is a good read for people who wish to learn Chinese history or have some understanding of Chinese history. It's pretty hard. Anyway, both books arrived in excellent condition and on time. Thank you!	1
I just got back from China and was in that area that's why wanted to read the book	1
I ordered the print version of this book (Silk Pagoda, 2008) from my local bookstore, and when it arrived, I noticed after maybe 2 sentences in that it was rife with typos. Maybe a page in, I began to suspect whether it was even edited/proofed by someone fluent in English. Then I went on to Amazon to look for another version of Romance of the Three Kingdoms from a reputable press (Tuttle Classics, 2002) that uses the C.H. Brewitt-Taylor translation, and the text was totally different! I am pretty sure this is some kind of knock-off, rip-off, bootlegged text. I haven't gotten around to getting a better copy and reading the story, which I am sure is excellent (it's a major Chinese classic, after all); but if you're going to read "Romance" in English, get a real translation.	0
There is no denying that Dream of Red Mansions (Hong Lou Meng) is an important piece of Chinese literature. However, I did not really enjoy this book. I found the characters to be frustrating and the pace slow. Although this is the abridged version, it is still extremely long and not an easy read. I can't imagine how long reading the unabridged version would take. Although I did not enjoy reading this book, it is a critical piece of Chinese literature. The book moves slowly through various episodes in Jia Biaoyu and Lin Diayu's life, demonstrating a new type of novel - the "chain-link" novel that could be read by the masses. The book also gives insight to Chinese culture. While not my personal taste, this is a good book for those studying Chinese literature.	1
the book was stuck and squeezed too hard into the mailbox, therefore, the cover is kind of scratched and the surface of the paper broke a little bit.  Since it is a gift, I am not quite like it this time.	1
This is a must read for every culture. Beautifully written novel based on Chinese history during the end of the Ching dynasty. Difficult to set down once you pick it up.	1
A Dream of Red Mansions is a wonderful book to read over and over again you will come away with a different feeling every time you read it.	1
This translation conveniently comes in a complete set of 4 volumes.  The cost per book is great, at a little over $7 per book vs. the $14 per book for Penguin's 5-volume series. Each volume is quite thick.  The entire series is a little over 2,500 pages, so it'll take a long time to read.  I find the translation to be satisfactory, especially of the poems.  The story is engrossing and keeps me turning page after page.  I often go back to reread beautiful passages.  Occasionally there are some illustrations. There are some areas in which the book could improve. -The multitude of characters and relationships makes it difficult to follow sometimes.  There is a family tree on one page, but the printing is unclear and small.  I had to find a family tree online to consult instead. -The glossary is too brief.  I wish that the notes were in more detail, as sometimes I feel I am missing out a lot of the symbolism and such while reading the book. -Lastly, I wish that the aesthetics of the book matched the beauty of the story more.  It's slightly unfortunate that they just put the title in the Impact font on the spine...	1
The Foreign Language Press has also translated the other 3 greats of Chinese literature: - Journey to the West - Outlaws of the Marsh - Romance of the Three Kingdoms I have read all of the previous 3 and been favorably impressed in the quality of the translations as well as the comprehensiveness of including the full novel. Other translations I have tried to read had more flowery but less accurate prose, or were abridged. It also helps that they are using modern Romanization guides vs. the old Wade-Giles, which is a must for anyone taking Chinese classes (as the Wade-Giles system has been out of use for decades). If you have never read one of these four classics, then don't look anywhere else and get this version of the books. If you have tried to read these before in a different setting but been unhappy, then give these a go.  This is as good as it gets and you owe is to yourself to re-read them in a correct translation. Yes, the pages can be thin at times but that's a minor annoyance compared to the quality of the translation/text.	1
This is long and very detailed and discusses chinese life at a time in history, ,but it takes commitment to read it.  Kind of like War and Peace, sometimes too long and frustrating as you read, but wonderful once you finish	1
It will take a while to finish, but I love the book so far!	1
I love these books!  I love the font, the size of the books and just tge general feel of them!  I truly enjoy reading and I have a deep desire to learn about other cultures and their stories!	1
I've stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book, which contained only 500 pages, and I've so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering, which amounts to almost 2000 pages. There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone. Join the "Redists", as the admirers of this book are officially called.... You'll find in it surprises of all kinds you've never dreamt of!!	1
I found that it was difficult to follow in spite of being very motivated. It may be a cultural thing so I am going to try to donate it to the the Asian history department of my local university.	1
This is a wonderful translation. I have read both the Hawkes before, and though it is said to be more poetic, he also takes far more license to create his desired effects. This translation is far more faithful to the original and allows more of the multidimensional layers from the original to come out.	1
Present Chinese culture rests on seven pillars. One of these is the sayings of Kung Fu Tse, the others are found embodied in the "Four Classics", of which this is one. An easy read, an easy interpretation. Highly recommend for any traveler, and those who want to understand our Oriental Neighbor.	1
I love this story, I have read several different translated versions and this one seems to cover the most in a very condensed paper back. The Original book is over 5000 pages I think and that is before the follow up author took it upon himself to finish the 1835 original unfinished work. Le's put it this way there are several movies the most recent with English sub titles is 28 episodes each an hour and a half long	1
Perfect	1
This is the story of a great Chinese family in decline.  It is told mainly through the lives of the women and servants of the family and a boy who loved the company of the maids who surround him.  The attention to every domestic detail is delightful.  I think the story takes place in the 17th century.  I don't think it can be read in a hurry.  One needs to be alert while reading so it is not a bedtime book. Allow a year or so to enjoy it.  I return to it again and again.	1
Not a good translation and hard to follow. I wish the translation was better into what is a classic book with many meanings.	0
This Chinese classic still has the power to surprise and delight.  This edition has good footnotes and good translation, and nice illustrations, though there are some typos and the print is smaller than I'd like.  I bought it used, and it was in very good condition.	1
I HEARD OF THIS CHINESE CLASSIC OF LITERATURE AND WAS ABLE TO ENJOY SOME SCENES FROM THE STORY WHEN I VISITED BEIJING, CHINA AND GOT TO VIEW A MAGNIFICENT SCREEN CONTAINING 60 PANELS CONSTRUCTED FOR THE EMPEROR AND CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY AT THE SUMMER PALACE IN NORTHWEST BEIJING. THE SCREEN WAS CREATED FROM PRECIOUS AND SEMI-PRECIOUS MATERIALS AND STANDS 2 METERS TALL. EVERY PANEL IS STRIKING IN APPEARANCE AND CONVINCED ME TO READ THE TRANSLATED VERSION OF THE STORY, BECAUSE OF THE DEDICATION OF ALL OF THE ARTISANS THAT CREATED SUCH AN IMPORTANT DEPICTION OF THE CLASSIC STORY.	1
Good	1
Totally engrossing.  The reader becomes enmeshed in the family and their day to day events. A great read.  Reads like a diary.	1
Was given as a Christmas gift to my mother in law.  She was very happy with the set.	1
I have this version as well as the one by the name "The Story of the Stone" translated by David Hawkes. I prefer this version over the other because it is straight to the point and, for some reason, I am able to enjoy and visualize the story better. The other book does have nice prose. However, it can feel like it's dragging on.	1
good book long on some chapter lots of explain but still good	1
gift	1
it is good present for sb want to read this book	1
Not a great translation	1
This book is like Anna Karenina in the following ways: Both are masterpieces of epic proportions. Both are considered contenders for being the greatest works of fiction in their respective languages. Both deal with large, upper class families and the lifestyle and intrigue involved. Both are works of realism and paint a complete picture of a society. A Dream of Red Mansions focuses on the love between Baoyu, an unusual child in his early teens who is temperamental and spends most of his time with the girls in the family mansion and Daiyu, a delicate, sensitive and yet witty and extremely clever girl. The two grow up as children and live in the same mansion but the family does not hurry to marry them off as they have other plans for Baoyu. This is the main thread that runs through the novel's amazing 120 chapters. The other sublots are very numerous - there are hundreds - but none of them are sustained for the whole book. The main part of the book is the set of characters. Again there are hundreds but a few main ones which become the most interesting in this drama. There's the conniving Xifeng, Baoyu's strict father, Baoyu's assertive "other love" Baochai and the like. Unlike Anna Karenina, this book is full of humour, jokes and poems (which was where I think the translation failed the most as Chinese poetry rendered into English seems to lose the plot!). It contains moments of great sadness but also wit and quirkiness. There's been controversy with the amazon reviews of this particular translation. I don't speak Chinese so can't judge it but reading the text, it seemed fine. I guess if I saw another or the original it would change my mind but this one isn't too bad. The novel deals with so many topics that you really get an overview of what life in 18th century upper class urban China was about. It is VERY long but it's amazing how in relating heaps and heaps of seemingly trivial incidents you grow to love many of the characters. It's like most novels are like meeting someone and hence only seeing what they want to show while this novel is like living with them. And trivialities aside, it's very moving. A must for all interested in Chinese society or who don't mind persevering through 1200 pages to read a one of the world's unusual and amazing dynasty chronicles and love stories.	1
There are two complete, unabridged translation of the greatest Chinese classical novel of manners "Dream of the Red Chamber".  One is the Penguin classics version translated by Oxford doyen David Hawkes and his son-in-law John Minford, now available on paperbacks in 5 volumes under the alternate title "The Story of the Stone".  The other is this China Foreign Language Press version made in the late 1970s by Chinese translators Yang Xianyi and his wife Gladys. With all due respects to the Yangs, their translation just isn't on par with the Penguin's.  The original novel is a paragon of how the classical vernacular Chinese language should be written; Yangs' version is stodgy and half-hearted and captures none of the elegance and depth of the original.  Their English borders on paraphrase at times and they don't appear to bother about stylistic recreation, eg. some sentences don't sound native at all - "The arrival of the edict rejoiced the hearts of all officials".  Believe me, reading the original is much, much better. The Yangs' works could be serviceable (as in their decent Lu Hsun) but this version of "Dream of the Red Mansions" is embarassingly outclassed by a far superior and more idiomatic rendition: David Hawkes's version is simply unparalleled and a labor of love. Given a choice between the two translations, it's a no-brainer: the Penguin is the winner anytime.	0
The Debt of Tears refers to Lin Daiyu's plaintive, obdurate settlement of her debt with fate and her surrender to lonely circumstances of death. Events in this despondent installment afford layers in increasing intensity of poignancy that presage Lin Daiyu's death and Baoyu's erroneous marriage to Bao-chai at the insistence of the Jias. The volume begins with an ailing Lin Daiyu dreaming a bad dream that confronts her pent-up fear and fevered mind. Like a rope on a pulley Daiyu's hopes and fears spin up and down with sighs and tears. Her health takes a huge toll and deteriorates drastically. The critical nature of her condition both alarms and frightens the maids who for fear of Baoyu's lapsing into delirium decides to conceal from him. While Daiyu harbors an acute sense of insecurity being an outsider in the Jias mansion and broods about being at the mercy of the Jias, the family deliberately reconsiders the auspicious match between jade and the golden locket. Baochai is crowned with praise for having the aplomb of someone twice her age. Her virtuous disposition finds favor in the eyes of all the ladyships. As the Jias frantically prepare for the wedding without Daiyu's knowing, the delicate frowner happens to eavesdrop the news and plunges into utter mortification. The prophecy contained in her nightmare is to be duly fulfilled after all. Bitterness and grief overwhelm her to the point that she conceives the only way to escape is death. She is determined to undermine her health and seizes her fate. The marriage between Baoyu and Baochai is an unfortunate mistake. It is an unexpected outcome of an incidence that should have otherwise favored Daiyu and spared her death. The sudden disappearance of Baoyu's jade, ponders Daiyu, nullifies the bond of gold and jade. But little does Daiyu realize that the loss of the jade on which Baoyu's life hinges causes the Jias to panic. The family resorts to hurry the wedding between Baoyu and Baochai to turn Baoyu's luck and rally his spirits. This paradox of the lost jade expounds the mysterious vagaries of destiny, the joy and pathos of life. Over the top of the hurly-burly of the Jias family life, there hangs the consistent reminder of some transcendental existence. Somehow the cycle of life is totally out of our calculation and grip. The wheel of karma is what inevitably governs the cycle of life and the human soul is only playing out a predetermined role. Life doesn't end at death for death is merely dispersion. The bitter end of the tragic story of love between Baoyu and Daiyu throws the former into a delirium. What follows would be a significant theme Cao Xueqin intends for the novel, elements that take on a greater emphasis than ever after Daiyu's death: Baoyu's enlightenment and disenchantment, the seeing through of red lust, and finally the abjuring of the world.	1
FYI, here is the review I posted on Amazon.com review for the Kindle edition of this same unabridged work: http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Mansion-Complete-Unexpurgated-ebook/product-reviews/B004XO01SA/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending It's by the same translator.	1
One of the great classics of world literature. Having read both this translation and the David Hawkes' five volume translation of this novel, I personally prefer this one. Although the David Hawkes translation is smoother and more literary for the English speaking reader, I find that the Yang translation better conveys the atmosphere of 17th and 18th century China and the complex relationships between the various members of the upper class Chia household and their omnipresent bevy of slaves and servants. I even greatly enjoyed, from a tongue-in-cheek perspective, the "sayings of Chairman Mao" inspired introduction to this translation. I'm now ready to embark on my fourth reading of this book in about as many years.	1
Even though some may say that the translation is less then brilliant I still enjoyed the story very much. I was quiet sad actually when the story ended. It made me feel like no other book had ever made me feel. I've always cheered on the good guys like in "Outlaws of the Marsh" or "The Three Kingdoms", but this time I really cared about these characters. Shakespeare's got nothing on this story. The charcters expressed the way they felt through poetry and music. I was in the room and I knew these people. It accomplishes everything every other story never could. I'm just afraid I'll never have that same feeling again.	1
I searched out this set because my teacher of Chinese medicine had told me that it was her favorite book as a teenager and that she still had the fondest memories of it - yet, she had never read it in English.  When I gave it to her, she beamed, opened to a random page and said, "I know right where they are in the story although my English doesn't understand every word."  When I saw her later she told me that her daughter was upset that she hadn't thought of this book for her mom as it brought her so much happiness!	1
This is book tells the story of a clan which is in the run-down. It is centered in a young man, Baoyu, and all his "sisters". Don't expect a story in the traditional point of view, I mean like greeks said: an introduction, a development and an end. This does not follow this trend, well, one could say that it sort of has an introduction and an end as a matter of fact but this book must be read as is, just daily life in the Rong and Ning mansions. Do not expect either a very deep story or characters, it is kind of superficial in fact although there a lot of characters and their whereabouts and machinations are told. It gives an insight though into what might have been the life in that land and in that time, keep in mind though that this still a book. An overall enjoyable piece.	1
Love the tale, compared to the other translation OK, but perhaps the other one is better	1
First thought: THE POETRY RHYMES, OMG!!!!! Second thought: Not the best story line so far, but when you're only on the first volume, you can't really assume much, can you? Overall: Worth reading, and so far is the BEST translation.	1
If you want to know the history of Qing dynasty of China, read it; If you want to learn decent Chinese, you must read it; If you want to enjoy the great Chinese culture, you defenitely must read it; The translation is also the best one I have ever seen. But if you try to read the original Chinese edition,maybe you will be more agreed on what I recommended.	1
i have not read a different translation of this book by a different translator. this is not a typical review but a comment about the method of translation, pinyin. and i, with difficulty, have not finished reading. here's why: if you are an english speaking person, or english educated you will have difficulty in pronouncing chinese names of places and people romanized by the pinyin method. the pinyin method is only immediately/"instinctively" useable for the chinese speaking/reading person tongued with foreknowledge. to a non-chinese speaking/reading person pinyin is pinyin-hell. because you *never* know how to say it in 4 or 5 different ways. even if you have heard how one pinyin name is correctly pronounced you are still guessing when you come across names spelt similarly. then, for the uninitiated, there is hope to be found in a set of "pinyin rules" (over 30 - oh joy!) where by one can amuse oneself with, repetitively, before embarking on reading pinyin books. these rules are quite "un-natural" or to put in kindly - foreign - to the english-speaking tongue. here are a few taken from the web: q  Consonant "ch" as in  cheek u  Vowels "oo" as in  too ue  Diphthong as "i" in  ship ui  Diphthong pronounced as  wee v  Consonant used only to pronounce foreign words  The Chinese have great difficulty pronouncing the V. w  Consonant as in  want x  Consonants "sh" as in  she y  Consonant as in  yet z  Consonant as in  zero zh  Consonant "j" as in  jump most pinyin-translations do not provide such a list of rules or coach readers in this matter, or explain how it is suppose to work. again from the web: Putonghua (mandrin) , the national dialect has four tones. The Cantonese dialect has the most, with nine. In the four tones of putonghua , the word "ma" The first tone (flat) "ma" in means "mother." The second tone (rising) "ma" can mean "numb" or "hemp." The third tone "ma" the voice dips and then rises, means "horse." The fourth tone "ma" starts high and falls abruptly, means "to scold." did that clarify the rules or compounded the difficulty? frustrations runs high and runs often. everytime a pinyin name comes up i cringe which is like every other sentence. for the casual reader, how close or by what degree it agree with the original language is hardly the key to successful reading or its enjoyment. if you seriously want to learn all the subtle tones i suggest you take up mandrin reading and writing - and then find the original version and enjoy that!	1
...and read "Story of the Stone". And this is about upper-class life, not "Exposing social evils, the book cries out denunciation against the feudal system."	0

Roger Ames and Henry Rosemont offer a new translation of this Chinese classic of Confucius.  While I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy or integrity of the translation, Ames and Rosemont have explained and offered justifications for their translations quite thoroughly.  The result is an informative version of this classic text attributed to Confucius.  Heavily discussing the ethics of ritual propriety and the need to be a "junzi" or "exemplary person", Confucius believed in wisdom and the law of reciprocity (the "silver rule").  Clearly he was concerned with preserving a moral tradition extracted from the collective understanding of the past.  While parts of Ames and Rosemont's introduction are tedious and could be better written, overall they have made a valuable contribution to the understanding of Confucian thought.	1
There are some real nuggets. Broken up into many small entries, although it doesn't help continuity it is perfect when you are waiting for a meeting to start. A difficult read, but, the ability to look up words right in the document is very helpful.	1
I can't comment on the translation as this is not my field. Reviewing from Joe Schmoe's point of view. Ames provides historical context and  constructs a framework at the beginning of the book with which to think about Confucius's teachings. The framework is applied consistently throughout this book, making it not only a much more enjoyable read but one where the meaning of translation comes to life. I am very thankful that Ames wrote this book as it has allowed me a glimpse into my heritage.	1
Easy to comprehend, captivating, informative.  Everyone should read this translation!	1
Everyone should read this book. I recommend taking notes in the sides of the pages to look back at later and also to see how your views change as you move along in the book and think more and more!	1
The chapters on the cultural/linguistic problems involved in translating Classical Chinese texts and whether the Chinese ever produced "philosophy" are more than worth the price of this book. Puruse the sayings of the Master carefully with close attention to the invaluable notes and a different world is opened. This is philosophy, Jim.  But not as we know it.	1
Just as described.	1
Excellent	1
The "wisdom" and "patience" in which Confucius analyzed each and every situation was very appealing to me. It causes one to "reflect" on every situation before acting or dismissing any topic that may be encountered.	1
What an excellent resource for Asian studies in general.  The translation is great to compare with Lau et al. And the other material sheds light on previous interpretations of the text and context.	1
If you are a University of Hawaii student studying Chinese or Philosophy, you will be reading this.  Be aware that while Ames has done a lot of great work in Chinese Philosophy, he is really doing 20th century postmodernism on a Chinese background.  After reading this one might think that Confucius belongs to the same school as Derrida, Foucault and Rorty.  That is as absurd as it gets. But academics do not make a name for themselves being correct (outside of the hard sciences that is).  If they were correct, they would simply answer questions in a way that satisfactory to readers and move on to the harder questions.  Instead, they rise to the top of their fields by being wrong in the cleverest way imaginable and that is what Ames has done.  So a generation of American students and scholars are being taught that Confucius would be right at home with some 1970's style sophistry.  It is actually kind of funny now that I think about it.  I guess when you start with the premise that "truth" is a social construct, you can believe anything.	1
I like having this book around to study from on occasion.  A lot of books don't include any Chinese language aspects so I chose this one for that purpose.  Confucius is definitely open to interpretation so taking the time to study the principles is a must if you are interested in it.	1
its cool.	1
Great!	1
Great book.	1
Potential buyers of the Kindle edition should be aware that I could only read the first page of the bibliography on my Kindle  -- a pretty serious shortcoming for a scholarly book -- though all of it is readable on a Kindle-for-PC application. The content of the book is first-rate. I have several works in this series and although I may not always agree, I do always appreciate the integrity and the overall quality of the scholarship. Based on content this would be a five-star review, but you have to call attention to the serious failings of the publisher somehow and a bad review is the only way I know to do it.	0
Great book! I will be reading this again in the future.	1
I needed this book for class and it arrived fairly quickly and the condition of the book was just as described. I was very pleased.	1
this is a biik it has words which mean things when you look at them in order it is referred to as reading some enjoy it Im somewhat undecided on the whole idea of the thing but hey your call	1

This book consists of an introduction, a translation, and an appendix. The introduction gives an historical and textual background, and outlines the philosophical approach of the authors. The appendix has some further remarks about a new version of the Analects found in a Han tomb in 1974, and more ruminations about Chinese language and philosophy. When I bought this book I was a bit skeptical about the subtitle "A Philosophical Translation" -- What kind of hybrid monster would that be? What would made a translation "philosophical"? Is this like saying: a "deep" translation or an "insightful" translation? And what does this choice of subtitle mean for other translations on the market? Are they now, by contrast, all "unphilosophical"? But... I decided to give the writers the benefit of the doubt, and see what they had to say. Unfortunately, after reading the philosophical introduction, I came away sorely disappointed and almost disgusted by the intellectual laziness and sloppiness of the writers. Instead of two people trying to think through the real issues that Confucius addresses, issues that are interesting *either* because they are completely out of date (merely of historical interest) *or* because they still may be relevant for people today, whatever their cultural background, I find two muddle-headed academicians spouting nonsense about the "basically substantive and essentialistic" nature of the English language (sometimes generalized to all Indo-European languages) versus the "more eventful", "relational" nature of the Chinese language. If you just squint your eyes a bit, and pretend to sort of vaguely understand what that might mean, and consider the evidence for this view, you find mostly smoke, pipe dreams, the half-digested remains of past metaphysical discussions. You find stupid, plain falsehoods, like the claim that all Indo-European languages have articles. You find a severely misleading account of Chinese grammar -- underlining the supposed ambiguity and vagueness of written Chinese. You find arguments like "The very expression 'thing' ... -- dongxi '' literally, 'east-west,' -- is a nonsubtantial relationship." -- Deep! The book could, I suppose, still be saved by the translation. Unfortunately, philosophy gets in the way and leads the writers to use some very awkward new terms, like "the authoritative person" for "ren". The writers are aware of the awkwardness and try to justify their selections of certain key terms -- which is good --, but mostly I found their arguments, again, unconvincing and disappointing. The arguments are often either circular or straw-man arguments. All in all, I didn't find special merit in this translation compared to earlier translations by others. The language often seems clumsy without need. Especially clumsy if you know enough classical Chinese to see that the original is pretty straightforward and seems very natural. As an example, here is the first paragraph of the first book: "The Master said: "Having studied, to then repeatedly apply what you have learned -- is this not a source of pleasure? To have friends come from distant quarters -- is this not a source of enjoyment? To go unacknowledged by others without harboring frustration - is this not the mark of an exemplary person?" "Having studied, to then repeatedly" - that's in my eyes just clunky and wooden. "a source of" - the original merely has: "is (this) not pleasant". Compare this with the old Legge translation (1861/1893): "The Master said, 'Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application? Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters? Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?'" The last line in Legge's translation is quaint -- after all, this translation is more than a 100 years old, but the first two lines sound more natural to me. (Ames and Rosemont claim that "junzi" doesn't have a gender basis, so would probably object to "a man of", but that seems nonsense to me: women are hardly even mentioned in the Analects, and from a purely linguistic standpoint I also doubt that their claim is true.)	0
(Background: Over a couple of decades' time I planned to read the scriptures of the world's great religions/philosophies. I started with my own, reading the Bible in two different translations, first the Hebrew-Greek Word Study Bible by Spiros Zodhiates, and then the NIV. Next I turned to Islam and Al-Quaran. After that The Bhagavad Gita and the Analects of Confucius. Every reading is helping me go a bit deeper and wider into man's search for God and, through that, meaning in this life. More books and reviews to come.) I read this book on a beach vacation a few years ago. I enjoyed it very much. I'd not read much previously about Confucius or Confucianism, the ethical and philosophical system derived from the man's teachings; this volume filled that void. The book consists of a lengthy Introduction--70 pages. The Analects are then presented in 20 "books"; the Chinese text is presented alongside the English translation. Appendices take up the remainder. What I enjoyed most about this book was the Introduction. The authors go to great lengths to explain the times that Confucius (551-479 BC) lived in--the government, the politics, the family structure--and the language of classical Chinese. This is most important to understanding a people, their culture, and what (and why) they believe what they believe, and how they build their civilization. We in the West know that the Orient is different; the authors gave me a better understanding of why. For example, in classical Chinese there are no words as there are in English for--among others--"freedom," "liberty," "choice," "individual," "reason," "autonomy." The authors write: "None of these English words has a close analogue in classical Chinese...." (p. 54). Let that sink in. I mean: *really* sink in. "Freedom." "Liberty." "Choice." "Individual." "Reason." "Autonomy." If you don't have a word to describe something, then that something simply and "correctly" does not exist for you. Frightening and eye-opening all at once..... So for me the Introduction and the insight it provided into Chinese language and, thus, fundamentally, Chinese thinking was worth the price of the book. The Analects themselves are stories of Confucius' wanderings in the countryside and his sayings on what he thinks is best for proper government, from the emperor down to local rulers down to relations among family. That's about it. But it provides great insight into Chinese thinking. The text at times is rather dry and straightforward. Don't expect "Confucius say...." nonsense. It doesn't exist. Read this book for the great introduction it is to one of the world's great and largest philosophical (some would say religious) systems. And also for the keen insight it provides into the Chinese people and why things are the way they are. What's past is prologue. Sept. 27, 2014 note: The September/October 2014 issue of Foreign Affairs has a short review of the recently published book "An Anatomy of Chinese: Rhythm, Metaphor, Politics" by Perry Link. The first sentence of the review: "Link focuses on how Chinese syntax is to a great extent ordered by speech and sound and not by the kind of grammatical logic at work in many Western languages. He scrutinizes the ways in which certain Chinese words take on metaphoric meanings." The book has a price tag of $39.95, but if you're interested in the topic, it sounds like a necessary book.	1
Confucius has been much maligned since he is perceived as wanting a static rigid society. This translation attempts to show that that is not really true. The translators and editors explain in the foreword that the Chinese language is dynamic, and therefore Confucius sayings does not reflect a static society, but rather a society in a constant flux. It does come out that Confucius will not tolerate revolution, but he does accept evolution. He is not preaching a static society, but rather that all development should build on the previous. While he stresses the importance of ritual, he also hammers in that ritual must be combined with warmth, caring, and even humour. A more gentle, less rigid, Confucius appears in this translation. Lastly, I think Confucianism relates to Daoism as Shaolin relates to t'ai ch'i (or Bruce Lee to Yang Cheng Fu): on is concerned with the external, and one with the internal. It is just a matter of which way you chose. Ones you have achieved mastery, there is no difference.	1
This is a nicely presented book, containing over 325 pages. The graphics are well done (cover, and layout of the text within, including the chinese original phrases, for those reading Mandarin). There's a lot of footnotes in the back, stimulating further research, and backing up the interpretations contained within, as well as an appendix with more material, that is intended to add context to Confucius' outlook on societal relationships and behavioral beliefs. Next, I had to admit that each page has different scenarios of interaction among people, or philosophical reflections, such  that, for some, this book is a cure for insomnia, no doubt. The fact that Europeans and North Americans have not been taught to read the Chinese alphabet or the language, further beckons understanding. Also, the 65 page introduction to the Analects is surely relevant as the author justifies himself, of some choices in terminology as compared to other translations and the works of previous tranlators. A read here on Amazon didn't understand how an archeological find could bring higher understanding of these classics from Ancient China. Well, the answer resides in the manuscripts. Much like the Holy Bible was discovered in several languages (Greek, and also near-Hebraic languages, for example) the meaning of the texts and the final translation will depend a lot on on the ability of the underlying language to express human thought, and the scholar's ability to read it, understand it, interpret it, and translate it for English speakers, no doubt. For $10 and change, this is a not a bad work to own.	1
This translation questions the traditional translations of Confucius'  ideas. "Ren" usually translated as "humanity" here  becomes "authoritative conduct" which is closer to Confucius'  original meaning of the word, which was "noble conduct." Another  unique feature of the translation is that the key Chinese characters are  highlighted as they appear, directly in the English translation. This is  probably not the first choice for someone unfamiliar with the Analects  because it is somewhat technical, but it's a must if you are looking for a  deeper understanding of the classic.	1
The only translation that is a pleasure to read for both its language and its profundity.  Ames and Rosemont bury the stodgy old Confucius and introduce us to a vibrant thinker--the kind of intellectual magnet that  attracted hundreds of followers in his own time and millions throughout  history.  Although their choice of translation for key Confucian  terms may seem unorthodox, consider where our 'orthodox' translations have  come from. They have come from translators with a knowledge of the  Classical Chinese language but all of the built in presuppositions of  Western (Christian and essentialistic) thinking (including, surprisingly,  D.C. Lau).  Since the standard translations (Legge, Waley, Lau), there have  been great strides in understanding the philosophy of Confucius' time.  Ames and Rosemont are not only experts in the language but are at the  cutting edge of ancient Chinese philosophy.  This book questions many basic  presumptions about Confucius' philosophy and deserves thoughtful  consideration.	1
Daomonkey's reviews exhibit detailed knowledge in Chinese philosophy, and I agree with many of his criticisms. But he has made a small error in his review of this book, which is important to note. This book is NOT by Hall and Ames, and thus does not show the proclivity towards 'pragmatization' that runs throughout their stimulating work. Rather, it is by Ames and ROSEMONT, a philosopher who has published extensively on topics in Chinese philosophy. You will find little by way of "speculative acrobatics and obsolete wheedlings" here. The unconventional nature of the translation may seem awkward at first but repays careful reading; Ames and Rosemont provide good arguments in the introduction for adopting them. (Also, the translation by Slingerland he mentions, published by Hackett, is indeed a fine translation with much running commentary.)	1
I got to know this book thanks to my English teacher who studied, while he was at Hawaii, under Mr.Ames. The introduction part of this book is very compact; it is full of insights about the development and formation of Eastern philosophy, and also about how Eastern and Western philosophies tend to focus on different values. What the authors had continuously stressed throughout the introduction - that they translated this book by considering the uniqueness, or difference that Chinese language and culture have - is indeed permeated through the whole book, making it more faithful to the original than ever. The book was, notwithstanding that the 'analects' is such a classic, engaging and interesting. As an Asian myself, I could explore further into my personal interest in Eastern-Western comparitive philosophy, together with refreshing yet faithful translation of 'Lun yu'	1
The authors acknowledge "the vagaries of translation," then fall victim to them. Overwordy, inconsistent and sometimes just plain sloppy. Translates _ren_ as "authoritative," which is about the most  misleading choice I've ever seen. The notes and discussion, however, are  quite good, and the original Chinese text is included. Pinyin romanization.	0
The "philosophy" of Confucius is nothing like today's analytic philosophy. Confucius, using the common language of those around him, spoke about the maintenance of rites and the importance of tradition. He did not write anything himself, because he was busy trying to push his disciples to get up and follow his example. He provides the deepest insight to his readers when he is most cryptic. Attempting to translate this into modern English at all is a difficult task, as the authors acknowledge. They claim that they want to aim for painstaking accuracy, explaining what they know about ancient Chinese society. And then they go off the deep end. Confucius speaks of carrying out the will of Heaven. The authors, claiming that "Heaven" is a Judeo-Christian concept, leave this untranslated as "tian", as if we were dealing with something as complex as Heidegger's Dasein. Confucius was never trying to be complex or inscrutable -- he was trying to smack down the "glib-tongued" sophists of his day and encourage virtuous behavior. Except these translators don't believe that ancient China had a concept of virtue, instead translating the single word "ren" as the impressive-sounding "authoritative conduct". Every mealy-mouthed replacement of a simple commandment with an obscure "philosophical" hypothesis distances the reader from the text and accomplishes the opposite of what the authors of the Analects were aiming for. This exact sort of behavior was ridiculed by Confucius in verse 6.13, but you wouldn't know it from the translation. Their version: "Confucius said to Zi Xia: You want to become the kind of counselor who is an exemplary person, not the kind that is a petty person." Very philosophical. My version: "Confucius said to Zi Xia: Kid, being a Confucian means being a gentleman, not being a scholar." This translation, to put it unpleasantly, attempts to shove Western philosophy into Confucius' mouth. UPDATE: I am eager to announce I have finally found a translation of the Analects that meets my needs. My lengthy review can be found on its page: 	0
This book is AMAZING ! If you really want to focus on an Eastern Philosophy (have time to focus & try extreme to learn) This book will Change YoU!	1
Much more interesting than I had anticipated, with a careful study of the rules that make up the fabric of an ordered society. It's not his fault that the interpretation became too rigid. as  happens.	1
how can I review this, it is what it is, a classic of Oriental philosophy. Even if you prefer Daoism this is still worth a read.	1
I wish I had shelled out a few extra dollars and bought this excellent translation in hard copy! This bilingual edition includes the original Chinese text (traditional characters) but the visual appearance of the characters is ruined in the kindle edition by extremely offputting graininess and pixelation. Unless the Chinese text is of no interest to you at all, you should buy the paper version. So disappointing. The more simple characters, such as 心、仁 and so on, are readable albeit ugly, but more intricate characters such as 德 just look like squarish blobs. Worse, increasing the text size makes no difference to the Chinese characters, which are apparently some kind of low resolution graphic inset, and so you can't blow them up to the point where you can make them out. Moreover, the fixed size of each piece of Chinese text varies from passage to passage, so some short passages have huge but grainy characters, while others have small and eyestrain-inducing ones. And that's not all - thee are a few typos in the translation itself, especially in the phonetic romanisation of Chinese terms. Don't rely on the text of this kindle edition if you are citing it in an essay! Do your eyes a favour and buy the real book.	1
Great book. I was able to find it on Amazon after it was mentioned in the Art of War. As soon as I realized I wanted it....BOOM!!!...it was in my hands in no time!!! 5 stars on this one.	1
The printing job on this book is atrocious.  It is completely shifted upwards making it awkward to read.	0
Perfect	1
Comme à son habitude, la traduction de Ames est remarquable, à la fois classique dans son approche générale et très au courant des découvertes archéologiques. Il s'agit là d'une traduction réellement philosophique.	1
論語のように解釈に多様さと幅がある原典を英訳することは、「一つの解釈」が代弁されることになります。原典の「主語のない表現」、「単数・複数の不明瞭な名詞」、「原典の用語の意味の多様さ」、等々が英訳に大きな制約を与えています。逆に、曖昧さを許さない「英語の文法上の制約」が、かなり幅の狭い「限定的な訳」とならざるを得ないことが多く見られ、大変に興味深いところです。「道」、「天」、「仁」、「礼」、「徳」など論語の本質にかかわる用語を、翻訳に先だって解説していることも、上記の「英語の制約」と関係が深く、全499節の原典を通じて解釈すべき「論語哲学」を英語の読者に理解させようとしていることは評価すべきだと思います。	1
Analects, in case you were wondering, are "selected passages from the writings of an author.” I mention this definition here because it seems that the only time we use the term “analects” is when we consider the writings of Confucius. Was there once a larger corpus of writings from Confucius, and is what we have today distilled from some larger body of work? If so, then I wish we had that entire larger body of philosophical work, the same way we have a good many books from classical Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle; but that being said, I certainly am glad that we have the Analects as a distillation of Confucius’ philosophy. His Chinese name was K’ung Fu-tzu, 孔夫子, and the Latinate name that he bears today was probably bestowed by Jesuit missionaries to China in the 16th century. By any name, however, Confucius is a great philosopher who speaks to us today just as clearly as he spoke to the people of Chinese antiquity. He lived a long time ago – when he died in 479 B.C., the Spartan defense of Thermopylae had taken place just one year before – but it is astonishing how current and relevant his words and ideas remain. “Analects” is, of course, a Latin- and Greek-derived term; in Chinese, the book is 論語,the "Lun Yü." It is divided into 20 books, and contains a total of 512 Confucian sayings, most of them quite short. On this re-reading of "The Analects," I encountered some sayings that were already familiar to me: e.g., “To say you know when you know, and to say you do not when you do not, that is knowledge” (II.17, p. 65). Yet on this reading, I learned many things that I found new. Perhaps because I’ve been reading a good deal of classical Greek philosophy lately, I found some striking parallels between Confucius and the Greeks who wrote sometime after him. For instance, when “The Master said, ‘Barbarian tribes with their rulers are inferior to Chinese states without them’” (III.5, p. 67), it made me think of how the ancient Greeks considered any non-Greek-speaking society to be βάρβαροι, barbaroi, barbarians. I found myself thinking of the doomed tragic heroes of ancient Greek drama, men and women brought down by their tragic flaws, when I heard Confucius reflect that “In his errors a man is true to type. Observe the errors and you will know the man” (IV.7, p. 73). Confucius knows that his disciples aspire to government service in the bureaucracy of the Empire – hence the prevalence of sayings in which Columbus offers advice such as, “Do not worry because you have no official position. Worry about your qualifications. Do not worry because no one appreciates your abilities. Seek to be worthy of appreciation” (IV.14, p. 74), Additionally, in an acutely status-conscious society, Confucius’ listeners are very interested in what will help them achieve the distinction of “gentleman.” With considerable focus on the value of benevolence, Confucius suggests that “The gentleman understands what is moral. The small man understands what is profitable” (IV.16, p. 74). And in one of my favorite passages from the Analects, Confucius remarks that “the gentleman hates to dwell downstream for it is there that all that is sordid in the Empire finds its way” (XIX.20, p. 155). Readers who are interested in the Judeo-Christian philosophical and moral tradition may be struck by the ways in which Confucius disagrees with one of the primary moral imperatives of Christianity. In contrast with Lao Tzu, who in the "Tao Te Ching" tells his disciples to “do good to him who has done you an injury”, Confucius says, “What, then, do you repay a good turn with? You repay an injury with straightness, but you repay a good turn with a good turn” (XIV.34, p. 129). In other words, the only thing you owe to someone who has wronged you is straightness, directness, honesty. For Western readers, many of whom have been raised in the tradition of “whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also” (Matthew 5:39), this may be the most challenging passage in the entire "Analects." At the same time, Confucianism invokes the Golden Rule in a way similar to all the other great moral, philosophical, and religious systems of the world. In response to a disciple’s asking, “Is there a single word which can be a guide to conduct throughout one’s life?”, Confucius replies, “Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire” (XV.24, p. 135). Perhaps because it is the dawn of a presidential election year here in the United States of America, I found that I was particularly interested in one particular example of Confucius’ advice to his disciples: “Be sure to go carefully into the case of the man who is disliked by the multitude. Be sure to go carefully into the case of the man who is liked by the multitude” (XV.28, p. 136). Good advice in the state of Lu during the Zhou dynasty, and good advice in any modern nation nowadays. I had this edition of "The Analects" with me when my wife and I were traveling in Beijing, home of the second largest Confucian temple in the world. Walking in the Forbidden City, my copy of "The Analects" in my jacket pocket, I wondered how many readers, imperial or otherwise, referred to their own copy of this book while traveling between and among the buildings of this most impressive city-within-a-city. This edition of "The Analects" includes a glossary of names and places mentioned in the book, an appendix on events in the life of Confucius, a textual history of the book, and a chronology of Confucius’ life. Particularly helpful is another appendix, one that describes the characters of the different disciples with whom Confucius speaks in the Analects. For readers of Confucius’ time, and indeed for followers of Confucianism nowadays, the differences in character among disciples like Tzu-kung, Tzu-lu, and Yen Yüan would be as self-evident as the differences in personality that Christians see among Saint Peter, Saint John, and Saint Thomas in the New Testament. This Penguin Books edition of Confucius’ "Analects" is a very fine way to acquaint, or reacquaint, oneself with one of the most important books ever written.	1
I own the Oxford World's Classics edition translated by Raymond Dawson. This was my first reading of 'The Analects' and while it was not quite what I expected, as it does not contain a truly coherent philosophy or even a consistent mode of presentation or authorship, it was nevertheless an incredibly rewarding study. And I say study rather than read because while it is quite brief (82 pages) there are a wealth of "chapters" that will leave you pondering--in a good way! If you are worried about the stereotype of vaguess and aloofness in Chinese sages, you needn't fear 'The Analects'. The main thing that can obscure some of the "chapters" is their reliance on Chinese history and most of these are briefly cleared up in Dawon's notes. 'The Analects' can be picked up and put down at a whim due to the informal structure and you will never feel that you lost the flow of it should a few days pass between readings. While I can't compare it to another translation or the Chinese, I found Dawson's translation to be very smooth and highly consistent throughout, and he supplements the introduction with helpful notes on his translation of key terms. This is an edition primarily for the newcomer rather than the scholar (not to say it is in anyway "dumbed down") as it is wonderfully concise in its introduction and notes, never saying more than needs to be said. However, in my case, I certainly wouldn't have minded more scholarship and context. Dawson uses Pinyin rather than Wade-Giles, which is a welcome shift in my eyes, as Wade-Giles often feels overwrought even if it sometimes comes closer to the true pronunciation, and there is a nifty conversion chart included in this edition. This edition like all of the newer Oxford World's Classics is neatly designed with a beautiful cover and good quality paper.	1
Confucius - The Analects is a rather intriguing book since it aims to tackle information regarding the well known Confucius in a cogent manner. The book is laid out in a fairly straight forward approach with no frills that's an extremely quick read. Within the introductory section, there is some background material featured, while a tad later on the book features notes on particular translations that the book offers.  Knowing how complex translations can be, it's a well-thought out approach to delineate what the book means by each translated term, instead of assuming that the reader will know.  Not only that, but also, certain words have various meanings, so to be able to narrow down with precision what was stated is greatly appreciated. For individuals seeking veritable gems of Confucius, this book has dozens of them. Reading this book will certainly help the individual realize how the culture was at the time, and why the information presented here was so vital to the upbringing and society in ancient China. The totality of the book is seamlessly interwoven to give you everything you need for comprehension, while not an iota more.  This certainly helps since other books can be longwinded at times. Taking all into account the book definitely belongs in the libraries of individuals who value such knowledge with resounding depth.  Confucius was definitely a master of his craft, and this book exemplifies that quite trenchantly.	1
I bought this version of the Analects together with Penguin Classics’. I think this one is closer to the original text, thus more paradoxical and sometimes baffling. Penguin’s is easier to read, but unfortunately that means that some paradoxes are “pre-solved”, an interpretation is already in place and part of the magic and wisdom lost. I think the best option is to read both, the similarities and differences are enlightening. If you have to pick one, my personal choice is OUP.	1
The Analects are widely recognized as one of the foundations of Chinese civilization.  Understanding them from a Western perspective is, however, difficult. There is simply no genre that the Analects fits into within the Western canon.  Add to this a wide panoply of characters who the neophyte will find it difficult to keep track of and the reader may be left with only remembering some of the more familiar adages of Confucius. This is not meant as a criticism of the text.  It is just that a casual perusal of the Analects is not possible in the same way that one could read, for example, Greek mythology. There are no gods and only oblique references to anything supernatural. Perhaps the practical nature of the text is one reason it has endured for over two thousand years. I am not trying to discourage anyone from reading the Analects—I just think that a more complete scholarly guide than is present in the Oxford Classics edition may be necessary to truly appreciate the work. Casual readers will probably be most struck by the difference between the Analects and ancient Western legends and retain some of the sayings that have parallels in Western ethics.  Anything more demands much more engagement with the material.	1
The Analects touches on the most important and deepest problems of life: self-mastery, social relations, government, family, and much more. Confucius urges us to follow "the way," to study, and to observe "the rites" as a worthy way of life.  He doesn't promise that one who follows this way will be wealthy or happy or enlightened or "saved," but rather that such a life is still the best one can live as it is decorous and ennobling.  I hear in the Analects a precursor to Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, which advocates a life pursuing virtue, with its attendant Golden Mean. Yet this is a very difficult book to follow because it presents no clear narrative and no obvious structure in our normal Western mode of Aristotelian definition, division, and classification.  Rather, it is almost a stream-of-consciousness collection of gnomic utterances from a variety of characters (mostly Confucius) presented with little in the way of context or chronology.  It works more by recursive themes, juxtaposition, and unexpected free association. So it's kind of like the way we experience the reception of insight in real life, which is one of the things that makes this a masterwork worthy of repeated study.  Indeed, I think this book is only profitable if reread and reread (I would say the same of Lao Tzu and the Bible). I find this Penguin edition to be a great choice for the first reading experience: D.C. Lau's introduction and notes give the first-time reader enough context and background to read this work with some understanding and admiration, but not so much as to impose an interpretation.  Please note that I do not read Chinese so I cannot judge the quality of the translation. I look forward to revisiting this little book again and again.	1
My interest in the Analects was to get a comparison between it and the Bible and the Koran The Analects was shorter than I expected. I had to scan a lot of  the masters advice to his students to get the underlying message which is the same in the Analects, the Bible and the Koran - Do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself.	1
I wanted to read some of Confucius’ writings, namely The Analects. What I got in this book was 50 pages of Chinese history + bios of some of the 70+ disciples + timelines + The Analects. If you’re an adult who can enjoy the brilliance of ageless thinking without someone else analyzing it for you ... don’t buy this book.	1
I feel like I should have paid more attention to the reviewers who felt just like I do. It seems to be rather boring in so many occasions. But I felt I had to read it personally. There are a lot of similarities in his teachings and the Classical Hellenic Philosophers. I wonder who learned from whom. But it does not matter. Teaching Ethics and Honorable Action by leaders is worthy to every one. Anyone listening today in Washington!!!!! Please read it and i might help you!!!!!	1
The Analects is a collection of aphorisms, anecdotes, and other snippets of instruction compiled by followers of Confucius around 2,000 years ago. There are no doubt many different versions and editions of The Analects in English translation. The one I am reviewing is the ebook edition from Open Road Media, which is likely based on the public domain file of the James Legge translation from Project Gutenberg. There is no denying the importance of Confucius in Chinese history and Eastern philosophy, but how does The Analects hold up as a reading experience for the 21st century reader? To a Westerner, like myself, even if you habitually read philosophy, it is difficult to just pick up a copy of The Analects and extract the wisdom contained within it. In form and structure, the Western text that most closely resembles The Analects would likely be the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. The Analects is divided into 20 books, which are then divided into numerous chapters, most of which are only a sentence or a paragraph long. Some chapters consist of a few brief numbered passages. Like the Meditations, there is no discernible order to these chapters; for the most part they just fall where they may. While each individual chapter can be studied for its own merits, you’d really have to develop an intimate knowledge of the book as a whole in order to understand all the connections between the various chapters and form a complete picture of Confucian thought. Though the teachings of Confucius form the basis for the Chinese religion of Confucianism, the philosophy of Confucius is really a secular philosophy that concentrates on ethics and politics rather than any metaphysical worldview. Confucius’s teachings were intended as training for scholars wishing to enter public service and work their way up the bureaucratic ladder of government. He also, however, looks into broader issues of ethics, interpersonal relations, right living, and personal happiness that may be relevant to anyone’s daily life. Some of the advice on governing may be applicable to the political and business worlds of today, but Confucius’s emphasis on knowing one’s place in the social strata is unlikely to be embraced by ambitious Western individualists. There are some similarities between The Analects and the stoicism of Marcus Aurelius in their advocation of resigning one’s self to the reality of one’s place in life. While the Stoic attitude might be simplistically summed up as, “You may be born a slave, but no one can enslave your mind,” the Confucian view in a nutshell might be something more like, “If you’re born a servant, be the best servant you can be.” Just as the first book of the Meditations refers to a number of ancient Roman personages that the average modern reader is unlikely to be familiar with, The Analects is peppered with references to historical figures of China’s ancient past. Such references are pervasive throughout The Analects, to the point where you’d really need a master’s degree in Chinese history to figure out much of what’s being alluded to. There are plenty of passages that clearly state a code of conduct for right living, or list the admirable qualities of a superior man, but these are interspersed between anecdotes of dukes, government functionaries, and students of the Master, some of which seem to require prior knowledge of the characters mentioned. What’s a Westerner to make of such passages without detailed explanatory annotations? There is relevant wisdom in The Analects if you’re willing to dig for it, but rather than reading the original text most readers would probably be better off consulting a textbook that explains the teachings of Confucius in an orderly and accessible manner.	1
This book is really insightful and contains all of Confucius teachings plus information on Confucious by the author which is really helpful to understand Confucius’ ideas. I ordered a used copy as it is more economic plus it had highlighted notes from the previous user which aided in spotting important phrases!	1
Inexpensive way to review Confucius and hopefully get insights on China which was heavily influenced by this man. I note in his writings an emphasis on the individual's responsibility to his master (boss), spouse, government, etc.	1
Philosophically and morally sound advice from a historic writer.  This is one of many books on my lifetime reading list now complete.	1
One of the most famous philosophers in history is Confucius.  This text covers various quotes and conversations with Confucius and his 36 disciples.  Since many of the sayings are spoken in mystical parables and some of the thoughts might  be lost in translation, it is not always clear what the message may be in many of these conversations.  Nevertheless, this is an important text for anyone who is interested in the many wise sayings of Confucius.  This book is broken down into what it calls ten volumes. Volume one covers fundamental principles and government.  The second volume discusses manners, morals and virtue.  The third volume deals with certain disciples and other subjects.  The master himself is covered in volume four.  The sage in his daily life is discussed in volume five.  The disciples, virtue, nobility and politics is explained in volume six. The government and certain rulers are covered in volume seven.  Volume eight explains the maintenance of principles and character.  The final two volumes cover recording unsuitable calls and ancient worthies, recorded saying of some disciplines and concerning the right government. In summary, this text would be of interest to anyone seeking knowledge about the sayings and philosophy of Confucius. Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Haiku Moments: How to read, write and enjoy Haiku)	1
I bought this book as a gift for my boyfriend. I was iffy about buying it after reading the reviews, but he loves it! It is the real thing, and he appreciates that fact. I haven't read it myself, but I looked through it and read a few quotations. I felt connected Confucius in a feel-good way.	1
Highly repetitive. I didn't feel like I got the character of Confucius. I was disappointed. Perhaps I should read a book about Confucius to find out more about his teachings.	0
This book was falling apart when I received it. I chose used because I have had very good luck in the past but this one should never have been sold.	0
Confucius. What can be said? He's a go-to for psuedo-intellectuals, wannabe philosophers, and internet egotists. But all the pretentious stigma aside, the Analects is a worthy read. If you're here to deconstruct morality, you're reading the wrong book. Confucius was a man of objectivity, and often refers to "the superior man" as one who upholds virtuous ideals, exercises discipline, and offers unwavering, indiscriminate compassion and respect for his fellowman. That said, his "teachings" read like a motivational book; His verses on conduct and behavior are humbling, and can contribute much to the one seeking self-improvement.	1
Amazing book, good gift for deep thinkers. Chinese Philosophy is one  you can apply to daily life even in the 21st century.	1
didn't cost more than a dollar and it shows. You truly get what you pay for!  Kindle prices are going up and the cheap stuff is not worth it anymore.	0
Had a paper due in a week and received the items in time to use as a reference.	1
Confucius is too obsessed with rites and customs, otherwise very astute about benevolence are primary in life.	1
Its one if top three books I've read in my life. It has so much written in so little. It's a book you can fit in your pocket, but it's big enough to change your life :D	1
The Oxford World Classics publication of The Analects is excellent, with plenty of explanatory notes.  My sentiments lie with Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, but it is worthwhile to study Confucius as well.	1
Arrived on time and in immaculate condition.	1
Great read.	1
Great reference text.	1
Came in Excellent Condition. I was mostly interested in this version because it has a very beautiful and artistic cover, I didn't want a version of the book with a plane cover. But aside from that it's A Very Good Book. Knowledge Is Power. 🐉	1
Was a gift for a friend	1

I enjoy this a lot. It is so nice to pick it up , read a little and ponder the meanings. Great to have it!	1
I leave this on the back of the toilet to confuse my roommates who constantly operate from a fearful mindset.	1
this man was a marvel it all boils down to do to other what you wish done to yourself. Too bad few people care to follow sage advice from those who came before us.	1
Helpful for a Religion Major tool!	1
The Amazon review system for this book seems to think it's some kind of novel. Hilarious, considering that it's wisdom literature. Well translated, with a few good notes.	1
Good value.	1
This book is very disorganized and it is very difficult to glean the main ideas from it.	0
Pretty easy to make it through, I have not read other translations but this one is understandable and a good read.	1

Oxford did a phenomenal job in the organization of this historic work. Confucius is undoubtedly one of the most influential men to have walked the earth, and "The Analects" is a work that all libraries should encompass. This book includes additional notes and insights, and is a great size to carry around with you, whether you desire some light reading, are on the train to work, or in a waiting room at the doctor. Well done, Oxford!	1
Hard to get into, but a necessary source book for tracing what humans accept and what is not accepted and the breadth of an admonition across human experience.	1
The book arrived in perfect condition and is exactly what I thought I was buying. Just ensure you want this particular version of this famous piece and you can't go wrong.	1
The book itself is good. The book was damaged on arrival.	1
It was suppose to be brand new, yet i got it folded and crumpled up.	0
Given to friends.  Necessary read.	1
Great	1
I just luv the flow! And yes the conscious elevation as well! Sincerely, Terrence W.	1

Confucius is worth reading for anyone's first eastern philosophical literary experience.	1
This book needs to be checked for spelling. Surely Penguin can spring for a copy editor. It's pretty bad in spots	1
A smooth translation	1
I had never READ this classic before. If you are into finding out more about OTHER faith structures, READ this.....it is illuminating!	1
Just like any philosophy, it is quite complex.	1
Great condition	1

Very interesting book.  You can read it in a night, and enjoy it.	1
Perfect	1
The Analects are crucial to understanding the culture of China. For this reason we use it as an anchor text in our document-based core course on the history of civilization. This edition is the most helpful I have seen. It is a good, smooth translation, and it is easily readable. Professor Wayne Detzler, Sacred Heart University, Fairfield, CT.	1

This is an incredible collection of teaching on wisdom and virtue (two of the most important things in life) by a man who spent his life studying them and passing them on to his disciples.  There is a great deal of truth to be found in these pages, and whoever reads them is likely to come away a better person!	1
Not the same as equivalent paper edition. No Chinese characters side by side?  Will this electronic edition improve?	0
Beautifully put together.	1
Alas, not a very good translation of the old classic. The style is rather awkward: only get if you're an enthusiast.	1
Excellent! Fast shipping and product was exactly as described! Would definitely buy from this seller again!	1
good translation. good gift for english reading friends who want to know more about Chinese philosophy.	1
GOOOOOOD!!!!	1
A great book. Has all of Confucius's principles in a nice tidy bundle. Short and easy to maneuver on Kindle.	1
A beautiful Eastern/Oriental Classic of Philosophy and Religion.	1
excellent	1
Confucius is just full of sayings, some I had heard, some were new to me.  I have enjoyed reading this book and learned from it.  My question is:  Who wrote all of the sayings down and then saved them?  OK, I looked my questions up and found that the Author was the Disciples of Confucius, and they wrote this in the 4th century BC, and was kept in a book called The Analects of Confucius.  Google has more answers.  :-) Enjoy	1
Great gems for any reader.	1
Awesome it's what I expected	1
Great teachings and learnings from a true man of wisdom and virtue	1
i was inspired by a college class to get this for further reading, and i enjoyed this edition very much. it had an excellent translation.	1
Very well laid out.	1
My nephew has gone off to college this year and some of his books were so expensive we were lucky to find some of them here on Amazon and at a way better price than a retailer Very pleased with the books we were able to find!	1
An excellent read, which can provide valuable insight not only into ancient China, but also modern day China. Excellent questions are asked, and excellent answers are given, everyone could learn a thing or two from this book. However, due to the translation, following who the message is aimed at (Masters and students referring to one another, or translations of common Chinese salutations etc) can lead to some confusing moments.	1
Thanks!	1
An interesting translation. I have found it important to read more than one translation because Chinese-to-English requires just that. Simple inflections change the meanings dramatically, so this is one of several on my shelf.	1
I had to purchase the book for a college class but decided to keep it after it was used.  I enjoyed reading it and find early Asian philosophy interesting.  Sadly, the book is difficult to read on the first go through and will require a couple readings and focus to get through it.	1
THE ANALECTS IS A GOOD BOOK FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND CONFUCIAN PHILOSOPHY.  THE TRANSLATION IS CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE, EASY TO READ, BUT IT DOESNT EXPLAIN WHAT EACH ANALECT MEANS AND BEGGINERS ON THE SUBJECT COULD MISUNDERSTAND THE MEANINGS. GREAT REFERENCE BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY KNOW CONFUCIANISM OR A LITTLE OF CHINESE HISTORY.	1
Great book! Had a little damage to it though. Perhaps damaged en transit.	1
Boring as hell; but sometimes it makes you think.	1
Item as described and fast shipping - recommended!	1
I needed this book for a class. It came in great condition, the printing is very clear on every page and there were no folds at all. The quality exceeded my expectations, definitely worth its price!	1
Great book! Gives insight into deep thought and chinease culture. Highly recommend this book for people who want to expand their understanding of Confucius and the impact he had on China.	1
I gave this book a 2 because it didn't come in the cover I expect it to be in on the webpage. In addition, the condition listed that it was very good but it was really a fair to me. Some of the pages in the pack were tearing. I bought this book for $4, but looking at the back when it was sold new, it was listed for $4.95!	0
gift for my son	1
For school	1
I would very much recommend this book for college students who are in honors programs that require specific reading materials. The price on Amazon was less than half of what the book store was charging for the same book. Great deal	1
It contains the analects in confucius's words and that is rare! There were translations after and i really value the book. Way to go Oxford!	1
An example of publishing at its worse. No attrubution of the translator, no previous publication data, no prefatory material, no index, none of Lau's appendixes [if indeed it is his trnalation]. It is a piece of crap. The binding is chep, the cover is the sort you find on cheap kids' books. Caveat emptor!	0

Product got here very quickly.  Book is in okay shape, good enough for a read once or twice, but not soemthing worth keeping as a reference tool or hierloom.  Has some pen marks and notes in it, I don't mind.  Incredible cheap, seller did a great job.	1
I do not accept Master Kong's logic or direction, and, in fact, think it is a lot of noise. However, it is worth serious study. I reject but many admire.  To study you need a very good edition. This is it. Brief, blunt, readily understandable. Much of the Master's work is fragmentary, much is cut off. That is reality. Everyone should study the works of Master Kong, however, as the story of Chinese culture if fascinating and, itself, enlightening. Master Kong still controls much of the thinking of the present Communist Party of China. Decide for yourself about the merits of the philosophical teaching, but this is an excellent book for study. Repeat: much of the work is fragmentary.	1
I only bought this because it was required reading in a class, and it was painfully boring to read. I'm sure there's someone who would like it, but I don't.	0
Thanks!! came in timely fashion, needed it for class...perfect & was correct! It's a good book & has a ton of great lessons to learn.	1
Not what I expected....	1
UGH	0
I did not read this book.  I ordered it for an out of state friend.  She wanted to read Confucious but I don't recall any feedback.	1
I found it very insightful, but the way it's written is very comprehensive. I found other Confucius books that were more of an easier read.	1
The Analects consists of passages compiled by the followers of Confucius, containing many quotes attributed to Confucius, together with comments from others about Confucius, quotes from his disciples, etc. Not being well-informed about China circa 500 BC, I found D. C. Lau's accompanying introduction, appendices, and notes very helpful in understanding the main text. The Analects are rather disjointed, with no overarching organizational thread running through the passages. They are also rather dry. They lack the poetic quality of, say, the Bhagavad Gita or the King James Bible (at least in this translation). But I found the central ideas in the Analects very appealing, and therefore liked the book considerably. Confucius thought that one should behave morally not in the hope of reward either in this life or any afterlife, but because it is the right thing to do. He prized learning, being benevolent, being trustworthy in what one says. For instance, the following quote by Confucius appears three times: "Make it your guiding principle to do your best for others and to be trustworthy in what you say." I also appreciate the sentiment that correct behavior changes over time, which allows me to hope that had Confucius lived in modern times he would have had a more favorable attitude toward women, who are barely mentioned in the Analects. Three more quotes of Confucius's that I liked: - "When you make a mistake, do not be afraid of mending your ways." - "It is not the failure of others to appreciate your abilities that should trouble you, but rather your failure to appreciate theirs." - "If a man remembers what is right at the sight of profit, is ready to lay down his life in the face of danger, and does not forget sentiments he has repeated all his life even when he has been in straitened circumstances for a long time, he may said to be a complete man."	1
The Analects contain twelve books (I to XX) each with around 15 to 50 numbered paragraphs. Confucius believed a leader that acted virtuously without resort to punishment could govern a country. Confucius lived in the "hundred philosophers period "551-233 BC. Two other prominent philosophers in that period were Mo Tzu with Consequentialism (see my review) and Han Fei Tzu with Legalism (see my review).  Many of Confucius ideas are similar to Mo Tzu, be it with some important differences (see later). The government never practiced Confucius ideas without including some of the ideas of Legalism, which emphasized the establishment of laws and punishment.  I have read the analects several times and analyzed each paragraph for relevance and usefulness to day. Many are. I learned a lot.  Many authors have tried to group these paragraphs under a few headings, some under the Chinese words, Jen, Chun tzu, Li, Te and Wen. The author presents in the Introduction such a summary of 46 pages of the  Analects text 102 pages.  My recommendation is to read the analects before the introduction and determine what you think is relevant to day.  Confucius presents ideas on how you should think and act. I  have selected a few of the paragraphs about government and the way to act that I hope  will encourage you to read the analects.  XII.19.Question. What would you think if I were to kill those who do not follow the way (do what is right)? Answer, What need is there for you to kill? Just desire the good yourself and the common people will be good. The virtue of the gentleman is like wind; the virtue of the small man is like grass. Let the wind blow over the grass and it is sure to bend.  II.3 Guide them with edicts, keep them in line with punishments, and the common people will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame. Guide them with virtue, keep them in line with rites, and they will, besides having a sense of shame, reform themselves  XVI.10 There are nine things the Gentleman turns his thought to: seeing clearly when he uses his eyes, to hearing acutely, when he uses his ears, to looking cordial when it comes to his countenance, to appearing respectful when it comes to his demeanor, to being conscientious when he speaks, to be reverent when he performs his duties, to seeking advice when he is in doubt, (be aware) of the consequences when he is enraged, and to do what is right at the sight of gain.   IV.15 The way of the master consists in doing one's best and in using oneself as a measure to gauge others.  VI.3 Yen Hui was eager to learn. Unfortunately his allotted span was a short one and he died". Mo Tzu concluded from this last paragraph that Confucius was a fatalist  All three philosophers believed that the ancestors were living in heaven and watching their descendants and interfering in what happened on earth. Elaborate funerals were held to show respect. Confucius supported rites and elaborate funerals. Mo Tzu said," if the officials sincerely desire to practice benevolence and righteousness and to benefit the people of China, they ought to adapt moderation in funerals as a principle of government.  The paragraphs also show that Confucius believed that it was possible for leaders to govern by acting virtuously and skeptical about the use of laws and punishment as advocated by Han Fei Tzu (II.3).	1
It’s easy to get caught up with the latest management fads, but hard to know which ones will endure. Indeed, Nassim Taleb writes about how time is the ultimate test for the fragility of ideas. So with China on the rise, what better ideas to look at than Confucius’, who lived over 2,500 years ago. His sayings are in this book, “Analects”, which are said to have been recorded by his disciples. What I've found is that Confucius was very good at understanding how to get the best out of hierarchical structures, which today would equate just as easily to corporations as governments. So I've picked out the best bits for business and modified the language to sound more contemporary: Basics of working: An overarching principle to work by is "do not impose on others what you yourself do not want" Someone who constantly learns will not be inflexible Avoid over-promising and under-delivering Money and status: Money and status are what everyone wants, but unless you get them in the right way don’t hold on to them It is easier to be arrogant when rich, then to complain of injustice when poor The good leader is at ease without being arrogant; the bad leader is arrogant without being at ease Don’t worry if you don’t get the job title you want – worry about your qualifications and ability to do the job. Don’t worry that no one appreciates your abilities – try to earn their appreciation Don’t blame others for not seeing your talent, blame yourself for not seeing their talents Managing others: Surround yourself with people that are better than you The leader enters into transparent partnerships, not factions/cliques To get staff to look up to you, promote the honest staff over the political ones People who are pleased with whatever the manager says is of no help to the manager A good manager helps others realise what is good in them, the bad manager helps them realise what is bad in them Leadership: Leadership is to know when you know, and say you don’t when you don’t Five things will make a leader great: respectfulness, tolerance, trustworthiness in words, delivering results quickly, and generosity Do not be impatient as you will not reach your goals. Do not be short-termist as you’ll not accomplish the big goals If leaders themselves didn’t act unethically, no-one would act unethically even if it carried a reward If a leader acts correctly, others will follow them even without orders, but if they are not correct in their actions, others will not follow even if orders are given For more like this, see bilalhafeez.com	1
There's no doubt about it- Confucius was a wise guy. If you're looking for quotes about virtue (or really anything) read this and I'm sure you'll find something. I found it interesting that certain values that arose in other parts of the world also arose there in China, completely independent. An example would be found in Book 12:2: "Do not impose on others what you would not like for yourself." Very similar to the Christian 'Golden Rule.' Quite interesting. If you're at all interested in Chinese culture/history, this is a must read.	1
There were a fair number of sayings in this book that seemed pretty irrelevant or impenetrable to the modern reader, mostly dealing with references to famous leaders of the past who would have been familiar to Confucious and his target audience, but who most modern westerners will have never heard of. Also, some of the phrasing is more than a touch convoluted. But there are a surprising number of the sayings that were perfectly clear, and perfectly relevant, even halfway around the world, millennia later, including a version of the Golden Rule. ("What I do not wish others to do to me, that also I wish not to do to them." Chapter 11, Book 5) I'm not certain how many of my complaints are due to the actual text, and how many are due to having a cheap translation with few notes.	1
I found this to be a fascinating book because it presents a perspective on social morality and the obligations constructed around having a family and a duty to the society you live in. I'm not sure if the translation is as accurate as it could be and there were times where the subtlety of the subject matter escaped me, likely because I'm not from china nor do I really have an accurate understanding of the culture in Confucius's time, let alone present time. Still, I found this book fascinating because it presents a different perspective on social responsibility and morality toward the people we interact with. I highly recommend reading it as an opportunity to expand your horizons both culturally and for social responsibility.	1
I was surprised to find that I was often very interested in the topics within this book and Confucius' handling of said themes. Having read Plato only a short time ago, Confucius seemed like a breath of fresh air. His concerns are how to live a virtuous life and achieve benevolence. Unlike much ancient philosphy, many of the sayings have their impact undimished by time. In each book (consisting usually of about 3 pages) there would generally be at least two or three sayings that struck me as truly meaningful and pertinent. Naturally, there were also some that seemed out of place or irrational, but that is to be expected in any text which is so old. If one is able to mine the gold from the rocks, Analects of Confucius can be quite a rewarding experience. However, I found the introduction and essays in the back of the book to be superfluous and felt that they did not shed much additional light on who Confucius was or what his teachings meant, choosing instead to focus mostly on minutue that was mostly uninteresting to me. This book is not a long read, and almost certainly worth a curious person's time.	1
The Analects of Confucius is one of the most influential books ever written anywhere. Although I cannot read the original Chinese, this remarkably lucid translation makes me feel quite close to the source. The translation makes a point of allowing some of the dazzling fragments in the Analects to remain just that without trying to smooth them out artificially. This is important as it allows the modern reader to appreciate the complex texture of an ancient text on its own terms. Both the introduction and the endnotes are quite helpful in elucidating some of the difficulties and the ambiguities in the text encountered by the general reader. Additionally, the size of the book is perfect. It is small enough to carry anywhere. Overall, highly recommended!	1
If, when you think of "eastern philosophy," yourheart goes pitter-patter for esoteric revelations from AscendedMasters, stories of Jesus practicing magic in Tibet as a youngster, oreven the mind-expanding wit of Zhuang Zi, you may find Confuciusboringly prosaic.  His wisdom lies in a different direction, and ismore subtle.  The Analects is like a bowl of Chinese dumplings, or attheir most flavorful dim sum, that you pick out one at a time andlearn the taste and value of.  Few of his sayings are brilliant, butrather the kind of mundane and kindly profundity that the war-wearyChina of the late Zhou found so filling.  In modern China, too, I havefound that Confucius is very popular, probably more popular than thewitty Lao Zi. Confucius said his teachings were connected by asingle thread.  While a disciple gave a slightly different solution,the thread I suggest you follow through this otherwise ratherdisjointed collection of teachings and observations is humility.  Bythat I don't mean self-abnegation or loss of individuality in thecollective, but an ability to see clearly in all directions -- above,towards superiors (ultimately God), below, compassion for the needy,within, ("To know what you know, and know what you don't know,this is knowledge") and without, to take an interest in the worldaround you.  (Confucius became China's "first teacher"because he himself was "eager to learn.") To me, this kindof integrated humility is the starting point for any worthwhilephilosophy of life. The Analects can also be of value to peopleinterested in the critical study of the New Testament, by the way.This book greatly resembles the Gospels in terms of genre.  Bothconsist of sayings and actions of a teacher who traveled with a bandof disciples, as recorded by the early community of followers.  Fewscholars doubt the historical character of the Analects, whilecontroversy about the Gospels makes headlines on a regular basis.  Itis interesting to me that the same internal arguments scholars likeCreel and Lau use to prove the Analects, apply even more strongly tothe Gospels.  If you do read the two sets of documents together, youmight try the further experiment of comparing Confucius' ideal person,sage or "Savior" as Confucian scholar Chen Jingpan describeshim, to the central character of the Gospels.  Remember that Menciussaid a sage would appear once every 500 years, and Confucius lived in500 B.C. As a Christian I respect Confucius not only as a great moralteacher, but also sometimes think he might have been a kind ofprophet. Five stars for Confucius; one lost in translation.Soothill seems accurate, as far as I can tell, and the price is right,but his language is a bit archaic at times.  Also, be sure to get aversion with notes. Author, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus Fulfillsthe Chinese Culture ...	1
Filled with totally obfuscated phrases like, "The Kuan-chu Ode is lively but not licentious, plaintive but not harrowing," are gems like, "Po I and Shu Ch'i never remembered old injuries, and therefore their enemies were few."  The thing about it, is that I read it cover to cover.  Clearly, this deep and old wisdom is best taken in small bits for not many words are wasted.  Also, the Lionel Giles translation I read was weak on supplemental commentary so I really felt like I needed a more knowledgeable guide as I was reading.  Perhaps the Norton version would have better annotations then the beautiful Easton Press version from my library.  It is clearly a five star book, but I think I only got about three stars out of it.  Most certainly a book to read again, and again and again.	1
I guess, there is not much point in buying this book for the text of Lunyu itself: it is available in full on the Internet (for example at Wengu: [...] - in the Chinese original, two English - including Lau's - and one French translation) but it is the introduction and adjoining commentaries that are of value. In this respect, I found D.C.Lau's work quite pleasing. He explains the main terms and how they hang together, illustrates his arguments with quotations from the actual Analects and tries his best to relate Confucius' philosophy to suitable analogues in the Western tradition. I am no China-expert, so this helped a lot. The book also has a post-script outlining Kong-zi's life and a short piece on the individual disciples and friends that Confucius converses with in the book. I think there is $9 of value (or whatever the price) in this book.	1
I was reviewing   when I found this book on Confucius. I have always been a fan of his philosophy and way of thinking. I like the fight and the believes he had in his times while others were more like following the troups and status of the dynasties. It was the wild west of the ancient world.	1
I had heard much about the Sayings, but after actually reading them, I can only say they left me quite unimpressed. There is very little in the book besides exhortations to be steady, sincere and to obey one's parents and  tradition. Nothing at all is said about any sort of internal transformation  as one finds in Lao-Tze. I can't read Chinese, so I can't say how accurate  the translation is, but if this is what Confucius was all about I just  don't see what all the fuss is about.	0
While 'Penguin Classics' paperbacks are generally some of the best on the market, the Analects themselves are, in this case, a bit out a date. Better translations have been made, in my opinion. However, the prose itself is well-styled and clearly separated. Concise and easy to understand. The fluency of the book is what seems most troubling.	1
VERY GOOD	1
It's amazing how after so many years Confucius thoughts are still important. Here you can find the basis for most of the later philosophists, including some universal principles of most religions. Even though it is not easy to read, with a little effort is a book to enjoy.	1
Thank you!	1
This book contains the essential antiquities of ancient learning that fostered the development of the philosophies in the west in a clear, easy to read format. I was amply impressed by the organization and  translation, and doubly impressed by the fantastic price. I would highly  recommend for anyone just curious about philosophy, or for anyone doing  scholarly research on this subject. 5 stars	1
This should be required reading for everyone by adulthood.  It gives you a unique perspective which no educated person should be without.	1
I dunno, but my son does, and he was please to receive multiple translations.  (too much wordiness in the world)	1
Essential for understanding East Asia	1
The quality of printing of the book (new) I received was rather poor.  I kept it just because I didn't want to go through the trouble of returning it.	1
Very instructive. I love it.	1
An interesting book with some thought-provoking quotes.  i don't know about other readers but it was a little confusing for me, i got the feeling much of what is inside needs to be understood in context, and thankfully there are a lot of side-notes to go with it.	1
The Analects, joined with a length introduction and notes on the key Confucsian teachings	1

Excellent quality and smart edition! Love my book, not to mention the content :)	1
this is another book I bought for my grandson going to university and according to him it's an excellent edition of it which he's very pleased with----I was pleased with the usual efficient service from Amazon	1
Fascinating!! It is a book to dip into and think about. It may be old and Chinese but has thoughts relevant to today.	1

Great book especially considering its age. Confucius is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest thinkers ever and his analacts, a collection of his thoughts and teachings are right up there with Sun Tzu's Art of War for the respect they still recieve today. Conficius has many great teachings in this very short book, I trawled through it with a highlighter and regularly go back and reread the lines which mean the most to me. Some of his ideas can change the way you think and act towards others for the better if you take them onboard and apply them in your life. This book would also be good for anyone who appreciates inspiration books like Art of War for application in management situations. The ideas may be able to help you better understand, communicate with and respect colleagues.	1
The book is considered as the Chinese Bible throughout the ages and widely read. Confucianism, as an orthodox philosophy, is based on The Analects. The book is a collection of Confucius's wisdom compiled together by his disciples. These teachings are still relevant as self-knowledge and pursuit of virtue are ageless themes. Now about the quality of the book. This book is awfully produced to say the least. This is a Penguin Classics edition and they just failed themselves to do justice to their fame. From the font selection to the quality of pages, everywhere a careless attitude is prevailing. The translation is up to the mark but the book has missed it.	1
Books from this edition are great no-fuss books and they're super cheap. This particular book however I found a bit harder to read because there are numerous references to individuals, locations, etc. which appear to be at the source of the meaning and in very few places are clarifications provided. Still, this book is in some places very much a gem, even/especially in this day and age.	1
Ancient taos (daos) Daos (taos) (I dont even) Are the best self help books. Most self help books are nonsense marketing titles. Confucius is a genius.	1

I had to return it. Got the refund. The page quality was not up to the mark.	0
Il n'y a rien de tel que la Bible. Les Analects sont des commentaires reformulés à la façon du "maître" voleur, qui tourne les versets bibliques en essayant de faire croire qu'ils ont été inventés par "lui". En somme du n'importe quoi, on s'ennuie. A load of BS of make believe, stolen from the Bible and twisted to fit "asian wisdom" from a common man. Waste of time and boring.	0
Must buy. You must add this to your home library collection.	1
I understand that this is no fault of the writer(s); Confucius has much less surviving work than western counterparts Plato, Aristotle etc. - and it can be a little offsetting.  This book won't read like Plato's "Republic", Aristotle's 'Politics' or pretty much anything else - it's more of a compilation of the sayings of Confucius (hence 'Analects').  Some excerpts are a single line, whilst others a whole page.  This makes for very easy picking up, as you won't need to remember where you left off, really. What I can make of this book is that Confucius was an extremely wise man, and it's a shame that he didn't write his own book(s).  Also, there are great footnotes in this version of The Analects, and extensive further reading material at the back of the book; in addition to a very scene setting introduction. It'll be a quick read (therefore buy it from a cheaper supplier), but unquestionably worthwhile	1

I purchased this having often enjoyed reading asserted Confucius quotes on sites such as wikiquote, and others. When I discovered I could purchase them in this form, I ordered it. About half a year later I started to read it, having purchased many classics at once. I am not a stranger to reading philosophy: odd, perhaps, considering my age (19). I had read Nietzsche, Milton Friedman's monograph Capitalism and Freedom, much of Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own, numerous political essays and opinion pieces, Machiavelli's The Prince...all those were much more 'cynical' than Confucius, who has a wonderful, if cautious outlook on life. Nietzsche, too, has this property, although it takes a reader to understand the underlying celebration, and to reach the joyful regions of his arguments. Confucius, known here generally as 'The Master', can be summed simply: he promotes 'wisdom' and 'benevolence' as the chief sources of happiness in life. To Confucius, what follows this is loyalty, social cohesion (if we strive for benevolence, then we are bound to please others, and thus have them seek to please us). In other words, Confucius believes that these elements help the reproduction of society, and the reproduction of man. Confucius refreshingly believes that men can improve themselves, and can become Gentlemen whether they are poor, or are rich. Becoming a gentle man (to twist the translation to show its etymological implications) is, therefore, a wonderful cause, and something which is rewarding. The early chapters are less interesting than the later, but I picked up and read this over a long period of time (a large break), so I may be wrong. I would read a chapter or a half every day or two, and would on the rest of my journey throughout the hours muse on them, internalise them, think on their wisdom. The less helpful passages are ones which are not as applicable to a secular, Western reader, such as about ancestor worship, and perhaps too the rigorousness of 'filial piety': obeying of one's parents, and the writings based around tea and rice (although we can substitute this and simply take the wisdom behind it). However, the principles Confucius founds these ideas on are sound and are rigorously applied: for example, Confucius writes that "If a man sets his heart on benevolence, he will be free from evil"- the same is true of Kings, Dukes, Lords, all of whom should lead by example- Confucius believed, having served in government himself in his younger years, that if their leaders were good and kind, so too would be their people. D.C. Lau's edition is thoughtful, and its footnotes are often helpful, particularly on corruption. Something I did not note until I was near the end of the book was the very helpful glossary of names after the main text, which I would recommend to use- The Analects were written down by Confucius' followers and friends, thus the majority of the sayings are based around dialogue between those individuals and The Master. Confucius' humility, wisdom and sticking to his principles are refreshing. Most importantly to this review, this book helped stabilise me at a time when I was uncertain and thinking a lot- Nietzsche may have turned me into a man of dynamite ("I am not a man, I am Dynamite", Ecce Homo), I feel Confucius helped turn me into a wiser man. Lightweight and easy to pick up, I'd recommend The Analects to anyone who perhaps wants to immerse themselves in one of the significant roots of China's culture, and to immerse themselves in their own mind and thoughts. Often the most favourable interpretation of a saying is best- be open and respectful (to be Confucian) and these sayings will help you as they certainly did with me. I only wish I had the volume here at university, something I will rectify when I return home. 5 stars/5	1
Great!	1

Good book of orientel philosophy	1
page quality is not good.	0
dis book is amazing and also contemporary. great book i have ever read. must read for all .very nice .	1
Always useful to have a copy to read when you have five minutes or so. Great introduction explaining the context too.	1
Other than in passing reference I am new to Confucius' body of work and The Analects have been an excellent place to start.  D. C. Lau's introduction lays excellent ground for the reader to understand and put into context The Analects.  It is this introduction that makes this translation stand out from others I perused before purchasing. Having read through once I now use this book daily as a reference of useful and practical principles.  Much of the guidance given by Confucius is as relevant today as it was over 2500 years ago.  In the spirit of Confucius, I would recommend you apply his teachings as part of your own personal quest to self discovery to improve the world around you. Ahead of his time, it is disappointing that Confucius and The Analects are not more common in education syllabuses to encourage young people to consider their environment, politics and relationships with other human beings.  In a society where ego is usually a guiding principle of success, I highly recommend The Analects as your own personal `check and balance'. I haven't changed the world and I've certainly not lost my ego, but the teachings of Confucius (in this publication) have helped me temper my arrogance and consider my relationships with friends relatives and colleagues; all for the better.	1
If you are interested in philosophy or just want to see what Confucius "really said", this is the book for you. Easy to dip in and out of.	1
Just what I wanted. Gives an introduction to Confucius followed by the sayings themselves. Couldn't have asked for anything more.	1
This is a very good Everyman edition of Confucius' Analects, with Arthur Waley's invaluable introduction.  Although the dust-jacket was missing, the book was in good condition and I am very satisfied. Essential reading for those wishing to understand China, where Confucius' teachings are tending once more to overshadow Marxism.	1
Worth Reading if you like Confucius.	1
The work of a master obviously, what else do you need to know.	1
I bought this book as a present this was by far the cheapest , delivery took some time compared to one I had bought at the same time from a different amazon supplier , but it arrived in a plastic wrapper unopened untouched , I was very happy and so was my nephew	1
This book is a collection of insights from Confucius over his lifetime seperated by periods. It is good that there are no interpretations only translations. People purchasing this book should be aware of this as it is a difficult read with depth of understanding required beyond that of a scholar. Good choice to read.	1
the writing is too small so have to send it back	0
Interesting.	1
Show me a man who don't know Confucius and i will show you a baby who can't be loved.	1
Questionable translation but a cracking read! Would recommend to any lads or ladettes out there who like a bit of Chinese philosophy.	1
This is a really good translation, easy to read and very easy to follow. I enjoyed reading about his travels, his way of treating his students and his love of behaving well. If you aren't particularly religious, it is a good guide for how to be a gentleman. Where it falls down, for me, is that there is very little attempt to answer the big questions: death, after death, God, why behave well anyway? But I still give it the full number of stars.	1
Fantastic must read book. After reading this book, I realized the the issues related to the "human factor" issues is real and last from few thousand of years. Its comforting from a certain point of view.	1
Good	1
Interesting if you love China history :)	1
論語の英語バージョンです。論語などの漢文は、正直言って日本語の読み下し文でも、現代人には判りにくい場合もあります。かえって英語の方がはっきりと現代語に訳すことができるので、内容はむしろ英語の方が判り易いかもしれません。皮肉な話ではありますが… 英語の勉強にもなりますし、それがこの価格で簡単に手に入るのは、一石二鳥、いや、三鳥かもしれません。	1
there is no Chinese original in this book, only translation. I'm looking for the the bilingual edition. The book is light and not very big, good. maybe I'll give it to my friends as a present.	1
Knowledge!	1
As expected	1
Interesting..	1
I found the Analects very uplifting and thought provoking and would recommend this book to anyone who likes to have their ideals and thoughts questioned.	1
Exactly as advertised, and shipped quick.	1
OK	1
I'm interested in most things of Chinese culture / history and am curious to find out more about Confucious - have'nt read much of it yet !	1
I like how confuciuses rules/words can be still applied in this age and i spot on in many areas.	1
This book is extremely fragmentary. The text is corrupt in many parts and that is acknowledged by the writer. It has more to do with the life, times, culture of eastern philosophy than wisdom. Emperors, lords, masters, servants.  It is okay as a book but you get the feeling that a completely new and revised copy needs to be produced. And where passages are inscrutable, they should not be included as interpenetrating them would be a guess. This book should be brought back to the drawing board, but has merit as a good work of philosophy and summary of eastern culture.	1
It’s easy to get caught up with the latest management fads, but hard to know which ones will endure. Indeed, Nassim Taleb writes about how time is the ultimate test for the fragility of ideas. So with China on the rise, what better ideas to look at than Confucius’, who lived over 2,500 years ago. His sayings are in this book, “Analects”, which are said to have been recorded by his disciples. What I've found is that Confucius was very good at understanding how to get the best out of hierarchical structures, which today would equate just as easily to corporations as governments. So I've picked out the best bits for business and modified the language to sound more contemporary: Basics of working: An overarching principle to work by is "do not impose on others what you yourself do not want" Someone who constantly learns will not be inflexible Avoid over-promising and under-delivering Money and status: Money and status are what everyone wants, but unless you get them in the right way don’t hold on to them It is easier to be arrogant when rich, then to complain of injustice when poor The good leader is at ease without being arrogant; the bad leader is arrogant without being at ease Don’t worry if you don’t get the job title you want – worry about your qualifications and ability to do the job. Don’t worry that no one appreciates your abilities – try to earn their appreciation Don’t blame others for not seeing your talent, blame yourself for not seeing their talents Managing others: Surround yourself with people that are better than you The leader enters into transparent partnerships, not factions/cliques To get staff to look up to you, promote the honest staff over the political ones People who are pleased with whatever the manager says is of no help to the manager A good manager helps others realise what is good in them, the bad manager helps them realise what is bad in them Leadership: Leadership is to know when you know, and say you don’t when you don’t Five things will make a leader great: respectfulness, tolerance, trustworthiness in words, delivering results quickly, and generosity Do not be impatient as you will not reach your goals. Do not be short-termist as you’ll not accomplish the big goals If leaders themselves didn’t act unethically, no-one would act unethically even if it carried a reward If a leader acts correctly, others will follow them even without orders, but if they are not correct in their actions, others will not follow even if orders are given For more like this, see bilalhafeez.com	1

This version was translated by a Chinese-American scholar who had moved to the US when she was 12 so the English was perfect and easy to read. She had a lot of added commentary which gave you a very complete and understandable look at the times Confucius lived in. She used other Chinese commentators on his work to add to the reader's understanding. He lived in turbulent time and I found his advice and admonitions to be relevant even to a 21st Century American.	1
There is magic in Annping Chin's commentarial remarks.  They clarify Confucius's words by providing cultural and linguistic detail.  This makes "The Analects" fresh and meaningful.  They "come to life".  I used to wonder why Confucius is held in esteem.	1
I've been trying to learn more about China, particularly hoping to get some glimpses of its present state by seeing its past. Confucian thought has been a driving force for many years so I dabbled in this book. As usuall, it answered less and aroused more questions, yet it still is amazing to see that basic human needs and wants rarely change. I wonder if the ancient Egyptians had something similar?	1
There are many English versions of the Lunyu (Analects) but this is arguably the best. The  English is lucid but the outsatanding feature is the annotations that explain much that would be obscure to general readers and even sinologists whose expertise is on later periods. If you are curious about Confucius, this is the book to start with.	1
I had to buy this book for a university class called CHIN-1090. I didn't understand the entire context at first, but then I read the Tao Te Ching, and in the context of the Tao Te Ching, this book now makes perfect sense.	1
I would like only the Analects, there seems to be to much interpretation.	1
Liking this a lot.  Currently wading through it.	1
Another great classic to enjoy! I love it.	1
Very well put together	1
The Analects is the primary work within the Confucian canon, but by no means an easy read. The format of the book is a compilation of sayings attributed to Confucius, followed by analysis by the book’s translator Chin Anping.  A clear strength is the updated translation, using the standard Pin Yin as opposed to the phonetically misleading Wade-Giles system, coupled with a more updated and correct understanding of the proverbs and sayings.  The work’s primary focus is upon moral character, stressing the need to be humane, the character of a gentleman, and how a just ruler should behave. For the latter, there is surprisingly fewer analects than one would expect, which may leave those wanting a more clear understanding of the Chinese mindset on governance wanting for more.  It is worth noting that the Analects is the first work in the Confucian canon, which was greatly expanding by followers such as Mencius and Xunzi.  Not an easy read, but an essential one for understanding Chinese views on morals and principles.	1
Can't wait to read this baby, the first one got lost upon delivery. This book is important for philosophy in general, but more specifically, it is both cultural and historical for the Chinese (which is really good to further your views). Hence why one might want to read it.	1
The Analects is to Ancient China what Meditations is to Ancient Rome. There are many versions of this deeply important work, but this translation by Annping Chin is the best of them all. Why? Because it is complete, one cannot understand the passages without commentary providing the context, and Annping Chin is one of the leading experts on the life of Confucius in the West, her translation and annotations bring the sentiments of the great philosopher-practitioner and his students to life. Secondly, this work features both the English translation and the original Chinese text for cross-reference. Confucianism is a philosophy that has many interpretations, it has survived for thousands of years and has a long way to go, this is the first choice text for understanding and important aspect of Chinese culture and receiving guidance for your own life.	1
Very good interpretation by this translator.	1

This is the first half of C. H. Brewitt-Taylor's translation of the 14th-century Chinese classic. I am reading his translation in parallel with Moss Roberts's translation. While I am unable to judge the comparative accuracy of the two renditions, as a reader I considerably prefer Roberts's translation, primarily due to his extensive and illuminating endnotes. Lacking the information in those endnotes, I think I would have been unable to appreciate the narrative. The one respect in which I prefer the Brewitt-Taylor translation is that he inserts paragraph breaks when the text switches from one speaker to another. He also adopts a somewhat more archaic prose style than Roberts does, which may appeal to some readers (though not me) as suggesting the story's venerable age. The original Chinese novel was penned over six hundred years ago, and is based on historical events from about 200 A.D. I note that I am finding it helpful to read each chapter twice, once in each translation. The book has a vast cast of characters, none of whom I was familiar with before, but many of whom would have been known to its original audience. Reading a chapter again allows me a sense of what it would be like if I wasn't trying to remember who everybody was and which faction they supported. (Although this is slightly undermined by the two translations using different schemes for transliterating Chinese names.) I will postpone comment on the book's quality as a story until I eventually make my way to the end. P.S. My rating of 3 out of 5 stars is as much a rating for the translation as for the underlying story, and I may well end up giving the Roberts's translation a higher rating.	1
This review doesn't really concern the story - Romance of the Three Kingdoms is justly a classic piece of literature, and it'd be slightly ridiculous to review the story itself on an Amazon review. It's amazing, and exciting, and definitely read it if you can. What I will review - and what I have significant problems with - is the Tuttle edition for Kindle. I can't really speak on the printed edition, but a lot of my criticisms, I suspect, will apply. Firstly, there are a ton of typos. I'm averaging one per page now. Things like: "Today her son is on the throne and all the officials are her friends/ and her influence is enormous." It seems petty, and normally I'd ignore it, but it gets on your nerves after a while. The fact that there are so many of these errors speaks to a lack of proper editing, I think, which leads to my next point: a lot of the prose is pretty bad, stylistically. It varies from place to place, but it's at best annoying and at worst a serious impediment. More than once I've had to stop and ask myself: "who is the subject of this sentence?" or even "who is the direct object?" which takes me out of the action while I have to parce the previous paragraph and see who the translator is talking about. The register of the translation changes as well - one second a character might be speaking in a very formal, periphrastic "bureaucratese" and then end the sentence with something jarringly vernacular. It seems like a minor issue, but things like that can confuse characterization and are just generally poor usage. More generally, the dialogue is stilted and artificial: "The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Chien Shih." Stylistically, it's an awkward sentence - why phrase it like that? It seems pretty obvious that the translator was probably not a native speaker - which is fine, as long as there's a strong editor to clean things up, which seems to be lacking here. The next one is a bit of a preference thing, I'll admit: usage of Wade-Giles. When I was learning Chinese, Pinyin was the ONLY romanization used. Say what you want about the merits of Wade-Giles, but Pinyin is what people are going to generally be familiar with today. So when I read through this and see (I think) Kongsun Tsan, I have to stop and translate it in my head: "Kongsun Tsan? Is that Gongsun Zan?" (I've read this book - different editions - a number of times, so I'm familiar with the characters. Otherwise I'd honestly be lost.) Now I hear what you're saying: "but what about the people that don't know anything about China? Wade-Giles would be so much simpler. That way people aren't pronouncing Cao as Cow!" There are a number of other issues in the book that make that a questionable argument. Firstly, WG has its issues here as well - Kongsun's "Kong" is not pronounced as in King Kong. There are a number of reasons why it would make a bit of obscure linguistic sense to write it that way for romanization purposes, once more to do with consnant voicing, but someone utterly unfamiliar with Chinese would be tripped up by it just as well as they would with Pinyin's c equalling (roughly) [ts]. But this is a huge digression. For the uninitiated there are somewhat larger issues. Most notably, the usage of ranks. The book is a bit ambivalent about this: when we first meet Guangong, the book notes that this signifies he is Lord Guan (as gong = lord). Other times, however, the book introduces ranks (Chinese ranks) without a single explanation of what it is: "so-and-so was at the time occupying the rank of ssu-tu." Well, ok - what is this rank? Where is it on the hierarchy? Is it low or high? For the record, ssu-tu is situ or "Minister of Education." It's worth noting that the edition didn't even get this right: ssu-tu would be si-du in Pinyin, as tu=du and t'u=tu. If you care, the apostrophe (as far as I know) here represents differentiation in consnant voicing. Why was it necessary to tell us this character was "ssu-tu" without explaining WHAT it was? (The Minister of Education, an important post, which would help explain why this person was in a position to plan a coup.) The book does this a number of times, which makes the sections revolving around court intrigue especially painful, as we're told person x had position a, person y had position b and person x had position c, with the positions generally not elaborated upon. The worst part is when the book half does this and half doesn't: "Commissioner X told Y Ssu-tu [note the Chinese syntax for titles] such-and-such." Some titles are fully translated and some aren't - so we're hearing Empress Ling tell Tung T'ai-hou (=Dowager Empress) something. It then switches. Overall, INCREDIBLY confusing for a book that has so many important interludes in the highly stratified court. So we have a confused usage of ranks (some English, some Chinese, some mixed) which at times have no explanation as to what they are or where they are in the court hierarchy. At best, we've been briefed once, and it's NEVER touched again. Why couldn't the translator simply render "ssu-tu" as Minister of Education throughout the book? What would it have taken away that was more important than clarity?	0
My mother in law recommended this book. Its a great read to learn Chinese history from a fictional book.	1
This is a great work of literature, and this edition's introduction is a great transition for the Western reader into the right mindset.	1
I would definitely have enjoyed it more if I could follow the characters. The characters are numerous and have VERY complicated and some similar names.	1
This is a must for those who enjoy history. It's a Chinese classic and I've read both books. This is reading I would recommend.	1
good gift for a dear friend.	1
excellent reading material - fiction historical of background China dynasty.  very interesting!	1
Bought this for my son. He loves Chinese history. This book is actually historical fiction. My son says it is great. In fact, he has read it many times.	1
great	1
I brought it for my husband, it was recommended by a friend. He loves it. He read  Clavell's Shogun and this book is similar to it.	1
AMAZING. From start to finish i couldn't put down these books. I recommend to anyone! Great gift for any reader	1
It's AMAZING! I love having background on favorite games of mine and this is Dynasty Warriors. I also love Asian culture and this book is fantastic!	1
Good book, very historical and insightful. A little difficult to keep track of the all the story lines but I enjoyed it .	1
This book came is in excellent condition and looks like it will be a great read. I bought it for my husband for Christmas and I know he'll be very excited to read it! :)	1
Absolutely love it!!	1
Excellent love factual history	1
Good Chinese historical Essay ....... the end of the Han Dynasty	1
This version of the book is  horrible, the names are all wrong or badly translated.  If you want to read and enjoy the three kingdoms look elsewhere.	0
Very historical and clearly relating to a Biblical writing in the February  24th 2014 article in the Daily Bread publication	1
Had wanted this for a gift, but now am not sure. The item was unopened, at least apparently, but had been noticeably dented on one corner, making me hesitate to use it as a gift item. Rather disappointed, although in checking the description it doesn't exactly violate it. Maybe I should have been more careful, but would have liked to have seen that in the description so I could have bought something else.	1
stilted translation makes it tedious going. Storyline evolves (is that the right word?)/wanders along, too much Chinese "structure" to this extremely predictable story.	0
This book is enormous. Two volumes with around 1,400 pages. It is a long saga, an epic some say, in a way a picaresque epic across the whole of China during the Han dynasty of the empire, when that empire was at risk because of internal strife and the incapability of the emperor to keep things under control, by his own fault (the own fault of several emperors one after another) and inability of building some kind of government that could be reliable, transparent and non-corrupted. And that is where the book is amazingly revealing. This empire is quite obviously a feudal empire. Power is in the hands of governors appointed by the emperor in each district. The governors are appointed for what these people did for the empire, particularly what they did militarily, and there the difference between serving the empire and serving themselves is not always clear. Ambitious people can climb to the top in no time and then impose their power. The decomposition of this empire started when the various feudal lords or lordlings started considering the eunuchs, organized in a very close community and clan, who were provided by the emperor with the full control of the government because the emperor is lazy in many ways and looks for an easy way to control such a big empire, and because the emperor is incompetent technically (ignorance of a lot of things necessary for government) and psychologically (unfit to exercise such an enormous power). He then relied on the eunuchs of the empire, a clan of men – and their relatives – who had been castrated for any reason whatsoever, among others to become the top officers of the empire. The most famous eunuch along that line was Admiral Zheng He who had been castrated at an early age because he was a Muslim and he became the top man of the Chinese fleet before it was dismantled by the Confucian Mandarins when they took over around 1430. These corrupted eunuchs encourage all kinds of outlaws to go around in the country and raid cities and farming areas to their own profit and to the shared profit with local supporters of the eunuchs. A rebellion came from the various local or regional lords who had the power and the means to raise armies. They united and finally succeeded in getting all the eunuchs eliminated and executed, but the main military force was in the hands of an ally of the local and regional lords, an ex-outlaw who shifted from raiding cities and farming communities to raiding the central government by taking control of it. The empire is then at stake because it explodes into rivaling cities and provinces and the central brigand controlling the empire spreads and increases his power by taking control of rebellious provinces. This is typically feudal. Power is in the hands of the stronger person, of the stronger clan, and stronger means military force and nothing else. Then this power is only a way for those in power to loot the country by levying armed forces and taxes for their own profit. Then the emperor can even be chosen, within the Han line, but for how long? That’s the beginning of the saga but that explains the whole saga: feudalism was the real social and political architecture of the Chinese empire. The main originality is that there was no spiritual or religious authority of any sort that could set some criteria and norms for everyone and keep the whole empire unified by some kind of spiritual allegiance, unity. That’s the main difference with European feudalism that was entirely controlled and governed by the Catholic church, hence by the Pope and his bishops and cardinals. Nothing like that in the Chinese Empire. So no Peace of God, becoming then Peace of the King in the various kingdoms, a movement that outlawed the use of military force within the limits of each kingdom and also within the limits of Christendom. That explained in part the crusades that started in the 11th century but it also explained the Teutonic crusade against the non-Christian Slavonic people in Poland, Ukraine and what they called Lithuania. War was directed to outside areas, officially non-Christian and to be Christianized. That started quite early after the fall of the Roman Empire and later on the fall of Charlemagne’s empire who only fought against the various Asian tribes or military forces trying to penetrate Europe from the East and against the mostly Muslim Saracens trying to do the same from Spain. And the emergence of such a spiritual force took a lot of time. The book was written after the takeover of the empire by the Confucian Mandarins and we could wonder if it is not a reflection of this evolution in the 15th century that inspired the author to show how bad it could have been before when the empire’s unity was endangered by internal strife and its unity was rebuilt later on by the leaders of the three kingdoms. We have to think of the other great saga of Chinese literature, “Journey to the West” by Wu Cheng’en, a saga whose earliest extant copy is traced to 1592 and is the story of a Monkey that travels to the west to discover the famous Buddhist scriptures that found the Taoist approach of life that developed in China as the spiritual guideline of the empire and can be considered as the basis of the Confucian Mandarin takeover in the 15th century. That is rather amazing to see this empire evolving from a purely feudal state with a marginal Taoist presence seen more like some witchcraft than anything else, though they carry the Chinese medical tradition and the ethical code of Taoism, the Chinese version of Buddhism in the making. Their final victory will destroy the Chinese fleet, the most impressive one in the whole world at the time, vastly centered on the China seas and the entire Indian Ocean and that would have been  capable to defend the empire against the European invasion that was still to come when Admiral Zheng He died. The result was a total closing up of the empire onto itself, which enabled the Europeans to come and take control of the whole of the Indian Ocean and then of the China Seas. Closing up on itself made the Chinese Empire weak, particularly the tool of its power was destroyed: the various commercial routes known as the Silk Roads. You will find all that in these books and it will make clear that the present commercial policy of China to reopen and redevelop the various Silk Roads is the only way for China to develop and recapture its past greatness. Will this policy re-establish some feudal state? Hardly conceivable. Will it establish some hierarchical centralized and unified system in the whole country and beyond? That’s also a dubious unrealistic view. China has to open itself to the world but that will not lead to the looting the English, the French and later on the Japanese tried to impose to China, but it may turn Chinas as the beating heart of the global economy, or at least one of the beating hearts of the global world using its commercial power rather than military force. That should bring you to wondering if the use of military force is not a feudal way of looking at the world and trying to dominate it. You may come to wondering if president Trump’s approach of the world is not a feudal way of looking at the problem in total opposition to and contradiction with the Chinese commercial approach of president Xi. To conclude I will say that Chinese literature, old or more recent like Lao She’s books and plays, is always centered on this problematic of the whole world in development and the choice between three possibilities: 1- pure military force and a feudal system; 2- pure spiritual closing up onto themselves and their protected own resources: some Confucian hierarchical architecture; 3- a general commercial vision that brings economic development to the world: modern sharing resources via some global free but regulated marketplace. Just get into this saga and enjoy the action and the treacherous ways of most of these feudal lords. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU	1
Romance of Three Kingdoms is a part of East Asian culture. It overtook the heart of both Chinese and Japanese as well as people in Southeastern Asia. In Japan even younger generation who rarely read literature enjoy the story in the form of either comic books or in popular PC games. In China many of the Chinese Opera plays come from the part of this story. Every Chinatown around the world has one or some Guandi(Kuan Ti) Temples such as those in Nagasaki, Kobe and Yokohama. The story is based on the history of ancient China around late 2nd century to late 3rd century when the Chinese continent was divided by three strong kingdoms, Wei(Gui in Japanese),Wu(GO in Japanese) and Shu(SHOKU in Japanese). Part of the popularity of three kingdoms in Japan must be credited for Eiji Yoshikawa, the author of Musashi, focusing more on the story of Liu Bei(Shu emperor),Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhuge Liang. Comic book adaptation by Mitsuteru Yokoyama who is best known by the author of Iron Man(Tetsujin)#28  paved the way for current three kingdom boom in Japanese pop culture in general. Liu Bei, an heir of Han Dynasty ruling clan, is a humane leader supported by Guan Yu, deft both in brain and might maybe eastern version of Knight, Zhang Fei,short tempered but really strong warrior, and Zhuge Liang the master of strategy. Rivaling Lie Bei is another giant Cao Cao outstanding ruler and historically known as one of the finest compilers of Sun Tzu's Art of War. Cao Cao courting the emperor Xian nearly took hold of the whole Chinese continent but was blocked by the allied forces of Wu and Shu in 208 as the dramas such as   depicted. Cao Cao is a bit demonized in this story but he is in fact one of the greatest rulers China ever had comparable to Napoleon. Lie Bei who has little power gradually gains by charming a lot of talented people by his couteousness yet with propaganda tactics to demonize Cao Cao.  Cao Cao soon recovered from the defeat of the Chibi battle and with the finest staff collected from the whole continent he sought to break the alliance of Shu and Wu. After the death of Cao Cao, Cao Pi took over and named himself the emperor of Weihan. But Weihan would eventually be overthrown by Sima clan who would subdue both Shu and Wu but Lie Bei, Guan Yu and Zhuge Liang are still loved and idealized by Chinese public. On first reading you will be enjoying the way the characters outsmart the other camps. On second reading you will be struck by the humanity upon which the story is based. It is much more than a legend. It will surely get you closer to the mind of either Chinese and Japanese. But be careful. The way character name is pronounced differ between Chinese and Japanese. Such as Cao Cao is pronounced in Japanese as SOSO. ---------------- Now I must add a few things for newer 3k fans who encountered this epic through koei games. Koei adopts Pinyin system for three kingdom character names and pinyin method has almost subdued English speaking community. Brewitt Taylor uses Wade system differing so much from the way the character names were currently spelled. For example. Cao Cao is spelled T'sao T'sao. As you can see older system is useful in pronunciation ideas. Verdict: Excellent translation getting you much closer to this Chinese epic. Must-read for chivalry novel fans. Rating: 94 out of 100. A bit cut by spelling confusion as I mentioned. Recommended for the fans of Sun Tzu's Art of War, Chinese dramas or action and war fictions.	1
This is an older translation; sometimes it opts for pseudo-medieval vocabulary, and as many others have noted, it uses the Wade-Giles system of romanizing the Chinese names rather than the pinyin one more often used these days. The newer translation by Moss Roberts probably reads better and has more apparatus, but is not available as an ebook. This ebook does allow one to read the Romance in English on your favorite Kindle platform, but the ebook, like so many of them, is quite badly made. It seems to have been scanned and run through an OCR program but not proofread properly, so that (quite aside from the Chinese names) English words come out misspelled on a regular basis. You can almost always emend the garbled reading, but it's a bit embarrassing for a once respectable publisher like Tuttle.	1
The story is truly a classic and the translation is pretty good.  However, the actual product is pretty sloppy.  Volume one was less problematic than volume two, but both had a high number of instances.  The main problem is that letters that are similar in shape, such as b and d, p and g, etc. get switched, almost once a page.  Also, the names weren't proofread very well, as apostrophes get pretty regularly left out.  In a translation system where an apostrophe is the only difference between the names to two characters or places, this becomes a source of confusion.  Also, entire words are left out pretty regularly.  I wonder if any highly fluent English speakers actually got to proofread this, because most of these errors are so obvious.  These errors aren't so bad that it is unreadable, but they really take a person out of the scene while the confusion is dispelled.	1
It is a well made TV series based on this classic. Characterization and acting are all excellent, I am especially impressed by the period costume and the set, they looked very well executed and certainly added to the enjoyment of the whole series. you can input the following to search YouTube:Three Kingdoms - Episode【01】English Subtitles	1
This is a very good bok, filled with brotherhood, strategy, battles, loyalty, chivalry, etc. And although quite long,it is still worth it. It is a cultural classic, just like the Iliad and the Odyssey are to Greek culture.  It has many misspellings but they are easily surmounted and pose no real threat to the stories comprehension. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading, especially those who enjoy historical,cultural, or classical books.  Note: This translation may be somewhat confusing to some people because it uses the more old-fashioned Wade-Giles spellings rather than the more contemporary Pinyin System.  If you were introduced to the Three Kingdoms through the multiple video games that are out,as I was, that use the Pinyin system, it might take a little extra thought on your part to understand who is who as you are reading. For Example, Guan Yu and Cao Cao in Pinyin become Kuan Yü and Ts'ao Ts'ao in Wade-Giles.	1
I love the Three Kingdoms. However, having read Brewitt-Taylors masterful exposition, this translation seems lacking, in my opinion. First, I must confess, I hate the modern Pinyin system of romanization. I cannot abide in a system where letters do not have the proper values. I mean, an entire generation of Americans (and God help the ignorant French!) will pronounce names like Cao Cao as "Cow Cow", or the Qin dynasty as the "Kwin" dynasty. The Brewitt-Taylor translation uses the old Wade system, and while it can be hard on the eyes, the reader gets a sense of at least the rough pronunciation (Cao Cao is rendered Ts'ao Ts'ao, Qin is rendered Ch'in, etc). Also, Brewitt-Taylors translation is nice to listen to. "Empires wax and wane, states cleave asunder and coalesce"; the sound itself is beautiful, and yet still renders the sense clearly. The Roberts translation certainly succeeds in the latter, but the beauty is lost. However, Brewitt-Taylor requires a very great vocabulary, whereas Roberts is more tame in this regards. Still, this was a book for scholars, and the translation should at least reflect that. Again, if you have no familiarization with the events of this tale, the complete rainstorm of names is daunting indeed. Always keep in mind the three separate forces (Cao Cao of Wei, Liu Bei of Shu and the Sun family of Wu) as well as a few of the other players (Zhang Jiao of the Yellow Scarves, Dong Zhuo, Lu Bu, Yuan Shao. Liu Biao and Liu Zhang) and you'll do fine. The book itself, in my opinion, is the greatest book ever told, succeeding in being at once a work of strategy, psychology, government, warfare, and human emotion, and there is nothing like it in the lexicon of Western literature. Enjoy!	1
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is one of my favorite novels. Unfortunately for this version, however, the story is not done much justice in its Pinyin translation. For newcomers to the series, it is quite difficult to become accustomed to it. I would recommend a Wade-Giles translation of this novel. On the plus side, this version is completely unabridged, so readers gain the full experience of one of China's great literary classics.	1
Details of the past are brought into sharp focus in this fascinating account.	1
It was a great quality and fur exceeded my expectation. I would choose used book next time too.  It is not only economical but ecological too. Thank You!	1
I enjoying reading it except the following problems: - Typos are almost appeared in every 3 pages. - Stories are not link between paragraphs. There are pages that I have to read 4-5 times in order to picture what is going on and who and who die. How about describe more about the heros when introducing them like, how old, what weapon they used and how strong. I believe those will spice up the book a lot more. EQ	1
Romance of the Three Kingdoms Volume 1 (Tuttle... Lo Kuan-Chung	1
Wow! Volume 1 of 2 (I believe) and I was initially very confused about the pronounciations and spelling of the names of the characters before I realised I was thinking in a very 'Eurocentric' way, without taking into account the fact that the translations within are probably more accurate than those in the console games that have developed from these accounts. However, having worked my way through my confusion, this is an epic historical piece, rightly broken down as thew weight of the entirety would be too much to lift! The story of the fall of a Dynasty and the turmoil that followed very much engages, although I suppose you have to have a hiostorical turn of mind to get into it. Not just a list of times, people and events but a full narrative that tells of both the personal and political struggles that surfaced during the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.	1
Perfect for the gift I wanted to give someone. Thank you.	1
Amazing book...such an interesting recollection of that era	1
I have read and reread "The three Kingdoms" many times over the years. It is one of the greatest novels ever written. This is why I have bought a new copy - the old one is too much "read".	1
Primera parte de esta enorme obra de la literatura China, excelente traducción, algo anticuada, si bien la edición deja bastante que desear. No entiendo porque los editores con el afán de reducir costes publican en papeles de tan baja calidad y no cuidan más el aspecto de este tipo de libros que merecen algo mejor.	1
Good quality, arrived safely from Germany to Canada.  My boyfriend was so happy to get this book for Christmas.	1
exam required	1
本書で採用している中国語表記法はWade systemですので現在流通 している中国語辞典とは表記法が異なり、地名・人名を読むことは できません。 図書館で古いWade systemを採用しているChineese-Englishの辞典 を探すことになるでしょう。渡辺精一や井波律子による邦訳を参照 するか三民書局の三國演義(繁体字中国語版)を参照するのがお手軽 です。 中国古代の官職名や制度名などの訳語なども、邦訳や中国語原文を 参照しながら読んだ方が理解しやすいです。 Taylorの英文自体は、かなり文語的で手強いのですが邦訳があるの で安心して味わうことができます。(Taylorの英訳からの邦訳では 無いですが、原文からの邦訳を参照するのでも十分楽しめます)	1
Was bought as a gift. He was extremely happy that he got it.	1
It might be a classic, but for readers used to modern writing, it's really quite difficult to follow. a plethora of characters with names so similiar it takes ages to realise who's who. I'd say only for enthusiasts of classic asian literature.	0
Very good story. The English is not very perfect but I liked it too.	1
Got this for the great reviews and the fact it’s “award-winning”....but who edited this? I’ve read 500 page novels with intense dialog between 5 characters simultaneously without typos or grammatical errors. I honestly am not trying to pick this book apart, but saw 3 before I even got to the actual translation. Perhaps I’m OCD, but I couldn’t get past the editing and returned this book the day I received it. Like another reviewer, I also get the impression I’m expected to buy many of the author’s other books to fully understand Sun Tzu’s concepts.	1
I have no doubts about the quality of the translation. However, the editing in the introduction is fairly sloppy. Not enough to dissuade me from purchasing this text, but still. For a book that has received so many awards the grammar and punctuation ought to be excellent from beginning to end. In the very first paragraph the sentence reads, “This work is based on many years of study the original Chinese and teaching the its strategy worldwide.” Although it’s a small mistake, I noticed two other grammatical/punctuation errors in the first three pages. Grammar pains aside, I’m looking forward to reading this text. This review is more for whoever edited this book to improve coherence in future editions.	1
I'm going to give 5 stars for the actual book and 0 for the kindle edition. The publisher should have made it clear that is not a kindle but just the book scanlated, page by page. Highlighting is not enabled, I'm not sure how is this better than buying the actual book. Actually it worse, If I had scanlated the book page by page for personal use, I could have used highlighting in pdf view.	0
Bought another translation of the art of war before and it was a joke. Finally a book that is not 32pgs and how it's listed is well organize.	1
Bought this for my son who isn’t a reader by nature, but is enthralled with this type of subject. He loves the fact that it is translated literally and feels as he has learned so much already from reading it, though not too awful far into the book. He is irritated that he has to put it down to read other things for his schooling. The best thing about this purchase is that I overheard him discussing the book and it’s some of the strategies with his Daddy the other morning rather than talking about the usual morning chit chat. That’s a good thing. He’s thinking beyond the usual.	1
Well written and precise!	1
Best version iv ever read.	1
one of the best ones out there, the author did a good job on the translation	1
Worst printing quality I have seen. The paper and Ink quality is very bad ... probably like many other  made in China products	0
Excellent book. I have several copies to give to friends and family!	1

This book can help anyone in a crisis.  It teaches you to be calm.  It teaches specific strategies.  Highly recommend.	1
Great book!! I always wanted to read this. These tactics still apply today. Military leaders should read this!!	1
Absolutely love this book!	1
Excellent.  Well written book.  Explains concepts and how to apply  them.	1
I like that the meanings of the text are explained in layman’s terms	1
Very good book.	1
Pages fall out, poor binding.	0
My husband wanted to read this and it’s an amazing read !	1
Book came fast and was as described.	1
Fast shipping, good read	1
I ordered this for my 17 yo son as a Christmas gift. I read it before I wrapped it. Very interesting. Full of useful information that can be applied to every day situations. I know he’ll love it.	1
I like to provide material that stimulates your mind. My son wanted this book and I was happy to purchase.	1
All products met my expectations	1
Arrived early and husband loved the book.	1
After comparing the Chinese text, with the english text, side by side.. I will compare the Chinese Art of War to cooking with sauce. It is like... living scripture. Openly interpreted. The english version, is like microwaving. You just get the food. It is already interpreted for you, which can be helpful as a hand rail, but, without the original Chinese you lose all the sauce, what makes the text brilliant in the first place. This is an unorthodox review. I will say, wow. I really like this book. This is the right version of Art of War for an english reader. Next level, would be to learn Chinese and read the original. It is an incredible law book.	1
Yes, there are grammatical and punctuation errors. Still, I have had 4 “versions” and for me, this is the best, easiest translation to read and actually understand. Course I’m a Redneck so words over two syllables do tend to confuse me. 😉 Bottom line, if you want a translation that makes sense and that you can understand, this is the one. 👍	1
The book is outlined pretty clearly and takes you from one topic to the next quite effortlessly.  The translation form the Chinese language seems very well done.	1
Good read... Everybody should read this some time in their life and apply it it in their daily life. It should be required reading for all business people.	1
Arrived as needed and stated. The book is s Christmas present. So I cant state more then that	1
Phenomenal book	1
For accuracy, and keeping true to the source, this book is great and contains the original Chinese and how they translated it just in case you wish to interpret the language in your own ways for a deeper meaning in a sense because words in Chinese can often have many meanings and be interpreted in multiple ways. What I did not like in particular was the occasional suggestion cropping up throughout the pages that in order read some of the extra art of war material, one would have to buy several other books from the same author as it's not all contained within this book.	1
I bought this to read on my kindle ebook but found that it was not compatible with my device. I had to return for a refund. waste of my time	0
Absolutely chuffed with my book, the only reason why I gave it 4 and not 5 is only because the writing is small, it would be brilliant if you could do it in large print, I did look but couldn't find any that were in English. 👍 and 5 for fast delivery	1
Highly recommended	1
Excellent read and informative	1
As per expectations	1
Nice gift	1
Qute amazing	1
Nicely done! The arrangement makes the translated text not only easier to understand, but allows the reader to comprehend the "Chineseness" of the text and therefore provides a much fuller comprehension of the tactics and philosophy of Sun Tzu.	1
If you want to read The Art of War, don't buy this thing. It's a 50 page outlined and bulleted version. Amazon is starting to annoy me with crappy vague representations of the products sold. The product description for this book is several paragraphs long but fails to mention this is not the actual book. Now I have to take the time to return it, or just take the $5 hit and use it as kindling.	0
Perhaps I missed something in the description, but this thing is TINY. It's basically a hyper condensed cliffs notes version, and it seems to focus almost entirely on military conflict.  (yes I know, art of war, what did I expect?)  The Art of War is more than a military handbook, it encompasses the subject of "conflict" more than actual military war.  It was meant to be as useful to a mother trying to get her child to go to bed, as it is for a general about to engage in a troop movement.  This is not actually a terrible version, its just chopped up and weirdly tiny.	1
Very misleading description and title. THIS IS NOT THE FULL BOOK. This is an abbreviated, 60 page recap of some of the chapters takeaways. It’s my fault for not looking at how many pages the book was before ordering but it should clearly say in the title and description that this isn’t the complete book. Disappointed with misleading information.	0
I was extremely disappointed after getting this book. I assumed it was the full length text (300+ pages) but what I received was a “pamphlet sized” text. You know what they say about assuming things, you can make an A$$ out of you and me..... well I did it to myself. To be fair.... the description DOES say 62 pages... I should have known better. None the less I put in a request to return this item as I have no need for 62 pages of bullet points... UPDATE: I received a full copy of the text and I went back to reference this text. ONLY A FEW CHAPTERS WE CLOSE TO SIMILAR... lots of different verbiage and it looks like the text was changed up to someone’s interpretation... DO NOT BUY IF YOU WNAT THE FULL TEXT!! Thank you :)	0
While I am partially to blame for ignorantly forgetting to read reviews prior to purchasing this product, it is also deceiving. I always try to read reviews to ensure what I am buying is legitimate and a worthwhile purchase. This is not the full text of Art of War, and it is never stated as being anything less. Upon receiving it I was disappointed immediately when I saw the size. While I did read it in about 20 minutes, it was quite a disappointment compared to what I wanted. My advice is to research before buying, as there are many of this watered down style floating around in Amazon.	0
Yes, it's about war.  But Sun Tzu's strategies for war work amazingly well in business and any competitive endeavor.  I bought a copy of this book to pass along his wisdom to a new high school graduate.  The format of the books is highly accessible and an easy read.  I have other copies of the book with additional notations and explanations.  They're fine for background research, but I like this version for quick access to Sun Tzu's insights.	1
A quick read that supposedly teaches skills needed in management or on the battlefield. Know your enemy. Never completely surround your enemy. Treat your army as you would your children; show them love, yet do it with an iron fist. Pretty basic stuff on how to defeat obstacles in life.	0
Purchased as a gift to one of my ROTC Cadets to begin their professional library. As part of a class assignment I asked each cadet what book would they no-kidding read, military or not, related to their academic major or not. After I compiled the list of books for the class I went online and ordered all the books from Amazon. I placed them at their seats prior to class and allowed them to enter the room w/o me being present for the first five minutes. It was, and still is, one of the good teaching moments of our time together. Thanks for helping me fulfill a need in their soon-to-be military career.	1
Description highly misleading. This is a 15 page summary, not the full book.	0
Whether a military warrior, a martial artist, or a business man, Sun Tsu's principles are timeless wisdom that can apply to many walks of life.  A great addition to your collection.  I keep going back to mine again and again.	1
It is easy to see why this material transcends through history,  and applies to military tactics to this day. It is also very easy to see how the philosophy of Sun Tzu serves as inspiration for so many martial arts as well. I'm glad I finally got to read the whole thing.	1
The book is as good as it has been for centuries, however, the narration was surprisingly bad.  The narrator misread many words throughout the book.  It was as if the narrator did not have adequate reading skills because they would say words completely different from what was printed.  This was confusing because the words the narrator said made no sense in the context of the sentence.  This made it so that i couldn't just listen to the book, i had to instead continually make sense of the narrator's mistakes.	1
The "brochure" is a waste of money and time. It's written entirely through numeric points that mostly make no sense. The sentences are written in very simple language, which could be either from the original author or a result of the translation. The described "tactics" are merely common sense, nothing surprising or extraordinary. The Art of War in this form of brochure serves at best to stabilize a wobbly table.	0
No where is the description it state this was not the full book. It shows over 4 stars on more than 800 reviews, so I thought it would be a safe buy.  This is only some odd abbreviated version of the book. It’s a waste of money, don’t but this one!!	0
Thought this was actually the book... turns out to be a 10-page pamphlet version.	0
I simply read this because I wanted to see what it was all about. It is a classic and has its place among Beijing in the most important ancient texts all g with the bible. I read this for fun and did not analyze or pick it apart. I recommend read it if you are into these kind of books.	1
This could just be my air but I always thought this was a large book and this thing is a paperback pamphlet size of a Jehovah witness brochure. For the price I guess it’s not bad but I was expecting a book.	1
The book is a classic and there very little to be said about this that has not been said by more experts on warfare then this reader. I recommend it to any person that is considering a career in the military. Volumes have been written on how to conduct military operations but in this case less is more, in this small book is a wealth of experience and knowledge that translates into the present state  of modern warfare. The shame is that many in the military that have read it can't seem to utilize the lessons to be learned that are clearly expressed in it.	1
Read it. Put it to practice. Highly recommend this book for anyone looking to achieve victory. Power overwhelming. Godspeed mortal.	1
I ordered this book thinking that it was the full book, however, when it arrived I was surprised to see that it was only summaries of the chapters and points in the original book. I wished to return it, but when I checked to print out the return sheet, there was no way for me to return it! I am sure the summaries are accurate and do provide a good synopsis of the text, but I would like to be able to find that out myself and read the full text.	1
Book is ok but only provides a brief summary. Table of contents does not correspond to any pages.	1
I purchased two versions. This one is the real deal. Only if you are waging war is it relevant. However, it is a classic and worth the read. It reminded me of Alinkski' Rules for Radicals. Another waging war document	1
I've heard about this book for many years. It's easy to understand why so many professionals beyond military Admirals and Generals apply Sun Tzu's principles. There are many concepts that have application in sports, business, and politics. I love how it gets tight to the point. Very refreshing.	1
Great.  Well written.  Helpful in many professions.	1
Bought it for my girlfriend and after reading it she was inspired to go demand a $15k raise. Now I stole it from her and I'm feeling ready to do battle!	1
So far the book is a great read. It is very detailed and a most read for all. Unfortunately, the copy I received was a little torn at the bottom of the first page, but it is still readable.	1
This is not even 1/4 of the whole book.  This book is maybe 1/4" thick.  The real book was at least an inch thick.  I've seen the real deal in bookstores after purchasing this.  Well played,  I'm not gonna ask for a refund for this cheap of an item,  but I'm sure not giving it a good rating.	0
This is an outstanding reference and handbook for strategies in war, competition and personal growth.  A treasure chest of ancient and time-proven advice!	1
What's not to like? Sun Tzu tells you all you need to know about war and how to win.  Apply it metaphorically and you win at life.	1
The book is deceiving it really is just an outline of the book, about 50 pages.	1
Great classic book. It was shipped to me a little bent, no worries. I've read it before but I lost the book and wanted it for my collection	1
It is a good book for those who wonder of war. Hopefully we.will never jabe to use this in any war.	1
This is not the entire book. I don't know why it doesn't state that in the description. It has good information though. I keep a few copies to hand out to people for reference use.	1
Still widely revered and used today. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of government, military, politics, and even some organizations.	1
Very misleading this is not the actual book! Buyer beware	0
This book reads almost like a bunch of Bible verses- quite random, segmented advice that is good not only for war but for life. Really quick read, but tons of pro life tips.	1
This is a  pamphlet of Sun Tzu’s sayings with no  interpretation or analysis of his meaning. I was looking for something more in-depth. Also the cover and description is not what I received. I believe all the items on Amazon are this pamphlet type.	0
Interesting reading.	1
Amazing and should be a must read for everyone. Tactics in all facets of life.	1
Great book	1
such a great read i had to buy it twice and give it away as a gift	1
The description was not clear that this is just basically a bullet point summary. NOT the full book. I didn’t read the reviews.	0
Turns out this wasn't the book I thought it was. It's just an overview of the book. Smh... alrrady in the garbage.	0
The ultimate handbook for anyone involved in competitive business, entertainment, finance. Really a great read and should be on the top 5 books any new businessperson should read.	1
I thought it would be thicker but I was in need of something to read!	1
This book is the defacto standard for studying battle tactics. It's also a great book to study as a business owner as well.	1
Thought what I was buying was the full "art of war" book... - it was not - just a cliff note...	1

Wanted a copy, love having in my collection, mught replace with a hardback at some point	1
The large surface area with so few pages makes it a bit frustrating to keep in good condition for long, although overall it's presented very well. Not bad for the price. Recommended for your first time reading or a copy you can take anyway without worry.	1
Thought  it was a book but it's only a long pamphlet.	0
I don't have anything new to say about this. Read it and think about how it applies to you. One more word was required.	1
Okay	1
Also made in large print to take up space. Very disappointed!	0
Worthless bullet point summary. Cheap pamphlet	0
I thought it would be a lot bigger and in depth  book but it's like an outline.	1
Product received is as described.	1
Can I give it -5 stars? Lesson learned!  Always read reviews.  Bad move Amazon.	0
I didn't know exactly what to expect from this book. This is as much of a philosophy book as it is on the stratagem of conducting a war. No battle scenes or gore. A quick read.	1
Too bad Obama never read it.  If he had, ISIS would not have come into existence.	1
Good book	1

My son loved this present, he had read a part of it at uni but is now happy he's read the whole book.	1
though not my favorite book it was still worth the read	1
A good translation, but just know that you're only ordering a 20-ish page SUMMARY, so don't get this if you're looking for the full text!	0
Simple explanations, and you’re able to interpret many things past the described war-time situations. There’s quite a bit to take away from it.	1
It is a great book. Enjoy it.	1

My husband has wanted this book for a very long time. Good price and fast service.	1
Bought this as a gift and realized the print quality is just so so, specially of the cover.  It's still decent if you are buying it to just read but not as a book to keep forever.	1
The best way to describe this is the Cliff's notes of The Art of War. Product is deceptive in the description. Thought I was getting the full book. Disappointed......	0

Great book.	1
Very sparse translation! I got this for a college class, and thankfully I had another version. There's no translator credited, or publisher outside of "Black and White Classics" printed inside of it, so citing this wouldn't have been fun. There's a small intro, and then the very basic translation. It actually came in handy when the other version of Art of War that i had got a little too verbose- I was able to refer to this one to get it "dumbed down a little", but I'm very glad I had the other copy to be able to quote, cite, and get more context for the class I am in.	1
Good read	1
Great read...	1
A must read for life lessons, business start ups, and actual war.	1
Excellent read!	1
If you are looking for the cliff notes, this is the book for you. If you actually want to read the full text, look elsewhere.	0
Book arrived in good condition	1
It is basically just a listing of SunTzu's principles. The cover art pictured was not what I received. I got cover art that just stated the title. Bookseller was good to deal with regarding this issue. Wish the book had some analysis or explanation or examples. No introduction verbiage nor back cover nor chapter verbiage.	1
This is a shortened version of the book, but it doesn't tell you that so It was kinda a rip off	0
Not full book. Was advertised as full book, but it’s more of an overview.	0
A very affordable price for a reprint of a classic.  It is much appreciated.	1
Same as always	1
Liked the organization by important concepts.  Good way to apply the info to my real life concerns	1
I believe this is required reading at our nation's Military Academies. I found it fascinating.	1
For military..excellant. I read this book while in Ranger training in 1967.	1
Fantastic book. Still very relatable today.	1
An amazing read.	1
This is the most informative book I've read in a while.  I'm very impressed!	1
This Book is the biggest knock off! Really disappointed in Amazon for allowing more and more knock offs to be sold on their site.	0

Item as described and items were shipped quickly.	1
That's not the edition I was expecting to receive. It seems like a 'watered down' edition of The Art of War.	1
Not the full book. Only about 50 pages of commentary.	0
This book came brand new and its content is applicable to many areas of life. It can speak to where you plan to go. I love it!	1

My mini-synopsis: This book is quite literally a guide filled with tips on how to go to war. It was written by Sun Tzu who was a Chinese general in the Eastern Zhou period. The book gives very specific actionable tips on how to be sure that your army will win a war. It has become very popular in the business world because many of the tips for war can be translated to be helpful in running a successful business. It is a very short read but is a great look into the mind of an extremely successful general, and gives great advice on how to build a successful “army”. Whether you are looking to win a war or win at business, Sun Tzu says, “Opportunities multiply as they are seized.” What I learned: I learned many tips on how win a battle using fire and spies but even more about how to run a business. The point that I found came up the most was to be unexpected. Never use the same strategy twice if you are trying to beat someone. In terms of how to handle competition, this is the best (least aggressive) strategy I found. Never do what people are expecting or you give them plenty of time to determine how they will defeat you. Additionally, a point that stood out to be was how tactics are like water. You can’t expect for a strategy that worked in one market to work just as well in another. Use it as a guide then be aware enough to allow the strategy to react to its surroundings, like water down a mountain. The final point I will make is a point that I have seen mentioned over and over in many books from most of the successful leaders (sans Jobs of course). Treat your people well! He specifically mentions that before “disciplining” them or pushing them too hard, they must fully trust you and be attached. Once again I am reminded that leaders lead by example which gives everyone the faith to trust them. Great quick read and now I feel like I need to go buy a samurai sword.	1
For the past 2 months I have been reading this astounding book called The Art of War. The Art of War has been changing the world around us for more than 2,500 years. It was written by a war strategist, named Sun Tzu during his attempt to defend his country, Wu, from its larger neighbor, Chu. According to The Life Guides, a youtube channel. This remarkable book has inspired George Washington to find hope during the Revolutionary War, it has also helped The United States of America and many other countries to defend against the Nazis, and has inspired President Donald Trump’s business strategies. This book has also changed me in some vital ways. Here are a few of them. First, in karate, I am able to use my energy so much more effectively by applying some tips from the book. For example, the quotes “appear where you are least expected, “when the enemy is taking rest give him none“, “appear strong when you are weak”,  “ and avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak”. This book has also helped me in my day to day life. I have learned how to manage my time and to prioritize what I use it for. This helps me to prevent from getting overwhelmed with work. I would recommend this book to a person who is willing to change himself for the better, and who is willing to put in the effort to read it and understand it to its full extent. A couple of major questions raised by the book are: Did Sun Tzu ever even write the Art of War? Many historical facts suggest that Sun Tzu was not the original author; and Is The Art of War fiction, nonfiction, or realistic fiction? We will never know the book combines various genres and is subjective to the opinion of the reader. Sun Tzu spoke in complex and diverse riddles about war tactics, how to be a great leader, and more. His voice sounded wise but commanding and kept me hooked throughout the book. I wanted to keep reading the book, and this is coming from someone who despises reading in general.	1
A great book, with a wealth of knowledge and strategies that can be adapted for use in conflict ridden or adversarial situations in daily life.  This book is just as relevant today as it was centuries ago.	1
Avoid this copy. Is not noted by the publisher which source is used, only that it is public domain. I do not believe they are following copyright laws even by stating just that. Look for a modern translation with a known author.	0
Diary of a wimpy kid is better.	1
This book is really a blessing to me. It really helped me a lot when it comes to important decision at my work and in my job that will matter the most in the future. I learned a a lot 'of new perspective when it comes to strategic planning, to those of you who want's a wiser and safer decision in my this is the book that's right for you.	1
Thank you for this amazing addition to my collection! Definitely recommend this seller!! 5 STAR!	1
Great for business strategy and tactics. Excellent guide.	1
This version of the book is definitely not the one you are assuming	0
Fake cliffnote book.	0
Not the full version. Very thin book.	0
Basic yet complex.  Simple yet profound.  Timeless  yet relevant.  Best book ever.	1
I bought as a gift. It was well received. Easy to read	1
I really love this book	1
A classic. Pristine condition.	1
Amazing!	1
Great common Sense is a great thing especially if it went through history and is still teaching valuable lessons with all that we've been through,good job Sun Tzu .	1
I always wanted to give this book a go, with all the references to it in pop culture etc., and seeing as it's relatively cheap I just thought I would chuck it on to another order I was getting. First of all, the book was far smaller than I expected it to be. It's very slim, and the content on the pages is arranged into points with significant white space between each one. Maybe look up some images of the book to give yourself a better idea of what you're paying for. I personally find the points can be a little hard to digest, which is understandable given that it's translated from an older language/way of writing. Once you get past that though, it's a good and interesting read with many good points and I'm glad I purchased it.	1
The art of this war is to get the enemy to read this book and send them all to sleep then attack	1
I have read the book before in its physical format. This e-book is not the full version of fhe book as it is much shorter (30 pages?? the full book is more than 200 pages). This product does not mention this fact anywhere. Scam. The real full book is really good. Just buy it from another provider.	0
If you can appreciate when this was written then you will understand the historical value of this book. A worthy read and a good place to start if you like war history.	1
Absolutely brilliant book. Some elements apply to all aspects of life. Very good book, nice easy read. Recommend to everyone.	1
Bought for son, seems pleased but hard to tell, as he perminantly has head stuck in s book.	1
Eye opening! 😲 I'm really glad I bought this now!	1
Learnt far more than i expected and raced through it, excellent. Ifvyou like strategy yiu will love thus.  Took 40 mins to read	1
Awesome book. Full of incredible quotes. Ideal to add to your library.	1
I liked the book, the only downfall is the cover which isn't thick enough. The cover bends and stays in the shape it's been in, not very solid. Otherwise, happy purchase	1
Worth the money.	1
Loved the book	1
Very thin and very basic	1
Bought this as a reminder to a business book I bought that had all of Sun Tzu's principles in, and this is a great little text. Not as detailed as the other book I had, but a great manual to add your own take too.	1
Great read	1
The book is a testament to the writer	1
5* once I started digging into this book I couldn't let it go. This book used to be banned long ago, such a bless to have access to it.This says all. Enjoy :)	1
Deep book, still with good application to modern times teaching a military mind, more should read this book as they say knowledge is power	1
Those interested in politics can learn from this, those that are interested in warfare need to understand it even more	1
I find it difficult to understand.	1
Its a very good book, it makes you think about strategies outside the box in every problem you face in life	1
Interesting and intriguing.  Applicable ideas and philosophy to other areas of life and relationships other than just war strategy.	1
If you buy this, you know what you want and it deliverd.	1
Dislike being forced to write a review while reading the book. Destroyed my train of thought for no good reason.	0
Splendid and very thought provoking. Admittedly it was the "Total War" series that brought it to my attention.	1
V good	1
Great book, insightful.	1

Excellent	1
good book	1
The book came in excellent condition. Packaged well from seller. I would highly suggest that when reading this book that you find a quite place to read it.  You will want to emerse your entire focuss on the story and absorb all info. It's not the same read if your being interrupted all the time. It's a great quite time reading book you will get allot out of. I loved it and it's now going on my coffee table. I will most definitely read this book again. Everyone's perception of this book is different so therefore that's why i suggested a quite place to enjoy the book. Hope that helps and enjoy.	1
Buscaba la versión en inglés completa. El libro es una adaptación, y además es demasiado delgado como para considerarse un libro.	0
