the  Kindle edition is literally a comic book version of this  The page is misleading
you get a  page comic book I was able to return for a refund
Cao Cao instead of Tsao Tsao which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class  There are maps I got really lost trying to followalong with the BrewittTaylor version Lastly
which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the nonfiction history of the  Kingdoms period The  classics of Chinese literature are indeed long about  pages
then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the  for a western reader  If you are going to read all 
and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor I had a hard time putting these books down
This is Moss Robertss translation of the Mao version of the Chinese classic Three Kingdoms
a highlyinfluential historical novel that covers a sweep of over a century from  AD to  AD
as signaled by the books opening sentences Here begins our tale The empire
must divide Thus has it ever been The authorship of the novel is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong
there were at least two main versions of the narrative a print edition from  well after Luo Guanzhongs death
and a subsequent major revision of this dating from the s The version from the s edited by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang father and son is the dominant one
and this is the version that Moss Roberts has translated The novel is episodic
and has a vast cast of roughly a thousand characters
over a hundred of which Moss Roberts classifies as major characters The original audience would have been very familiar with the storys heroes
was entirely unfamiliar with the characters and the historical period
and would have struggled to make sense of it but for Robertss extensive and very helpful notes Even with the notes
I am glad that I read it The scale of the story is epic men scheme and betray each other
huge armies  sometimes of over a hundred thousand soldiers  battle The book also reminds me of Chinas long history of civilization Despite dynastic struggles
as I likewise found other famous moments in the story underwhelming The lengthy story never once brought me close to tears I never came to love its heroes If I had the stamina to reread the whole book
perhaps this would change Knowing what lay ahead
I read this in parallel with BrewittTaylors  translation
and I considerably prefer Moss Robertss version
both for its prose style and for its invaluable footnotes plus an illuminating onehundredpagelong afterword Secondly
this edition includes occasional illustrations
though their reproduction quality was sometimes poor Fourthly
the book contains a fair amount of poetry
not so much in the rest of the world If you want to understand Chinese strategy
but if you invest the time and make good use of the excellent Moss Roberts annotations
I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of
small print and annotations in even smaller print I have to use a magnifying glass to read them Eventually I bought the volume larger format set put out by University of California Press The print is larger
but still small  but at least I can read it without a magnifying glassAlso the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself
The books that I got has a few issues Ive only looked through the first book at this moment but I saw that names and words are randomly misspelled throughout the whole book Also the text is slightly offcentered on the page like its slanted Its as if someone had placed it on a scanner in a crooked way I have screenshots of this attached notice that the Character Yuan Shao is spelled as Yuan Soao and that the margin gradually widens throughout on the right hand side I expected higher quality control that this This is not acceptable
the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus
Aurelian reunited the three kingdoms and reestablished the Empire It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time
this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together For the Englishspeaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern
unadorned English To me the names all seem alike
and decides hed better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known Hes the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience The books  volumes in paperback cover a period of several decades with numerous marches
including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 
men on  fleets of ships and on land Thats the Battle of Red Hill While it can be a little tedious because its so huge
the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature While theres a map
with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction Apparently the author
was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives Some of the characters are real people but its clear the story has been doctored at numerous points Also
which is extremely helpful although its scholarly and not written for the general reader
whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so its hard to imagine how the original text treated him So
the authors were working a thousandplus years after the event Its not history A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new
any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and peoples names are spelled differently Of course
literature from a foreign culture that doesnt use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme
Bought the digital version for a cheap price of  Story quality is fine
at low resolution The Kindle PC app doesnt allow maximizing and justifying so the panels are like  in size I had to manually reduce windows resolution very low as a workaround Using a surface for vertical aspect ratio doesnt help much either
the only unabridged version translated by a native English speaker who has been furiously studying Chinese history and language I had purchased the ebook version and was disappointed to find those to be incomplete I bought them as a gift for my bookworm hubby
since he was hoping to get into some Chinese classics This book set has helpful footnotes providing enough contexts and also figured and maps We compared this translation with the more recent one translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Iverson Together we concluded that Moss Roberts translation is more elegant
Ive heard many stories and references to this book growing up it is kind of nice to actually read them for myself  Unfortunately I cannot read Chinese at all so I had to rely on finding a translated version I came across and attempted a BrewittTaylor translation a while back but could not finish the book through that version  The names of all the people and the way it read did not quite flow as nicely for me  This version by Robert Moss is fantastic It reads nicely and is full of notes and annotations that provide a much deeper understanding of the story
history and of the book itself The quality of the books are nice
the text is not to fine or big to read  I am tempted to now shell out the extra  bucks for the hardcover editions  I was only a bit disappointed the shipping of the product which seemed to damage it some bent or crushed a bit on edges
The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale
but the quality of this specific collection You should note that the author
and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment Pros  This translation of Luo Guanzhongs masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful Youll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight  Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters
locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong
and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang Cons The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves  There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just werent edited out Ive never seen so many mistakes in a book before  The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to
I just want to offer my opinion about this edition the  volume box set printed in  I believe it is   The story itself is a fantastic
engaging read  The language is fluid and I am finding that it is a lot less dry than I expected and so it is very easy to get through the book Deciding which edition to purchase was my biggest problem
I have no issues with this one  While I read some reviews about spelling errorsand indeed they do existthey are not at all frequent and detract little from the story  I also read that the characters names occur in three forms
so its no issue My advice to the reader who has never encountered the story I have played the games and done some preliminary research on the era is to read up a little on the history of the time  Start with the end of the Han through the Three Kingdoms period and this will at least give you a foundation for what is going on  It will also familiarize you with some of the names and the important players who ruled at this time The only thing this edition could use are some good maps  Being that it is a box set
a few seperate inserts that can be referanced along side the books would be great
and an amazing story  the tapestry of legend and historical fact is well enough woven to give one a sense of what actually happened while having a few over the top events because there is no english translation of the annals of the three kingdoms
this is as close as an english speaking person is going to get to understanding the period if the number of characters is overwhelming
the dynasty warriors series of video games actually serves as an abridged version that helps to identify the major players in the ocean of hundreds of characters
this is a classic of Chinese that is relatively unknown in the west  This epic could be considered the Shakespeare of the Chinese language  It depicts the decay and collapse of the Han dynasty  In the process of this decay
and tragedy  This novel has thousands of characters
but perhaps the main character is Kongming
the military strategist of one of the kingdoms  Its a pure pleasure to read his elegantly executed strategies This translation has a modern feel
so it was easier to read than other translations that I have read  Robert Moss does a good job of making the story flow  However
it doesnt have a poetic feel  While the story has been translated
it is always difficult to translate literature into other languages  Having said that
I think this is an excellent translation for those who want an easy read or those who are reading Three Kingdoms for the first time  Also I strongly recommend an unabridged version
such as this one  If you read an abridged version
the story wont seem well developed  The full text is necessary  I especially recommend this novel for those who are studying politics
I went through nearly  dollars worth of books in one month buying single volumes A month later
youll get the names and spellings you might be more familiar with  like Cao Cao instead of Tsao Tsao   Its also a good set if you plan on buying other Chinese Classics like Outlaws of the Marsh or Journey to the West because they all have uniform editions   The only possible negatives are since they are somewhat condensing a really long novel into four thinner volumes
the actual pages seem a little thin I worry from time to time about ripping them   There are also a number of typos But in all honesty
I dont really notice them With the story moving along so quickly and the presence of alreadyforeign words and names
a typo now and then wont make you stumble in the least THE BOOK   Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a really great albeit long story This is the fictionalized story of a real civil war period in China that occured after the Han dynasty fell The names
you will not be bored by anything I often get bored by books
you should most definitely read the original tale Plus
you may have a head start on the complexity from knowing some of the charactersevents already   If youre at all interested in ancient warfare
youre already aware of just how importantincredibleenjoyable this novel is  Truly a great entertaining story and yet so many lessons can be learned from it  Its no wonder why this is so widely taught in most Asian school systems I will
comment on this specific volume package  This is arguably the best packagedset available at this time for those that want to read the novel  Its not a collectors edition  theres no leather binding or any other highend detail associated with it
etc  Its broken up into  volumes page numbers are continuous  so volume II starts on p and the overall quality is actually pretty good  Its your typical paperback book Prior to purchasing
I read a number of reviews complaining of how thin the paper was and that it made it completely unreadable  I did not find this to be an issue  Yes
the paper is probably thinner than one would expect but nothing where it poses a threat of being damaged easily or anything of the sort  I also didnt find any issues with being able to see the lettering on the subsequent page as its shadow is visible on the page youre reading  Yes
its noticeable especially when there a poem  as the poems are indented but again
I didnt find it to be an issue I debated back and forth on what version I wanted to purchase and I can honestly say that Im quite pleased with this purchase  Its good quality
its packaged nicely in a boxed volume set each volume has notes at the end  so no need to search for notes in another book as is the case with other versions
its the unabridged version a MUST  please avoid any abridged version  as they often leave out so much
and its affordable complete set costs as much as one volume of other sets  Its also a Moss Roberts translation  something I would recommend  And it also uses the pinyin Chinese translations more easily pronounceable  in my opinion  Nice introduction
good notes throughout
etc so also a great option for those studying the novel Simply put
and accurate translation then this is the one for you
I will say a few words about this book  Its a long story and it took me over  months to finished it  I did enjoy this historical novel which is said to be  based on history and  fiction The characters in the book are more alive in the readers imagination than in the book itself because there isnt much character developement  The book doesnt flow or read smoothly instead it feels almost mechanical  But the events and the actions take a life of its own in the readers imagination  I dont know the Chinese language but maybe there were some essence that was lost in the translation The events and the strategy that were used in that era of history were brilliant  Even though this happened hundreds of years ago
I would reccommend this book for those who have some interest in China or that era of Chinese history  I give this book  out of  stars because of the lack of the character developement which would have made this historical novel much more enjoyable and readable
Anyone that has played the games or Dynasty Warriors should really read the books They can be a hard read at times with the names but it is well worth it
i have read them more then once and still i love them There are SO many stories that the games never touch on that will just amaze you even farther about the beloved characters in the games
The tactics of The Art of War is pretty much used throughout the book by many of the warlords The multiple layers of military deception and feints gets so deep that it creates the oddest strategy of all Predicting that your enemy will anticipate a trap or deception
thinking its heavens wish to eventually reunite China which probably keeps China from becoming like Europe
all the battles are very tactical  If youre interested in Game theory
then this book is for you This is an awesome epic novel
accurately portrays the lives and feelings of these heroes The author is a little swayed by the Shu family
this is a long and worthwhile read I would recommend the unabridged version as it is more complete and thorough You will not be disapointed to see these wonderful characters come to life
This is an awesome set Complaints about how thin the paper is I find to be unreasonable The paper is completely adequate  now the New American Bible  thats thin paper The typos are slightly annoying but not too much of a big deal The translation I find to be very readable The material is dense and the footnotes are vital The amount of information on even a single page is astounding and does not lend itself to a quick or passive read Anyone who has read more difficult historical works such as Thucydides or Caesar shouldnt have any problem with the style   Like most I became aware of this story through video games
specifically the Dynasty Warriors games The games were a good primer for the actual text
as the reader already has mental images of the characters and battles  while the mental images of the characters conjured by the games may not be historical
they lend themselves to remembering and differentiating individuals  which can be difficult for western readers because of the Chinese names which naturally seem foreign and hard to remember to westerners I have always had an easier time with Japanese personal names over Chinese personal names
The writing style is interesting
though it is fairly obvious the tale was meant to make Cao Cao out to be the villain and Liu Bei to be the ultimate in compassion and goodness  Despite that
it is a roadmap to over  years of a culture the West generally knows so little about  Much as the tales of King Arthur
Three Kingdoms can read on many levels from light entertainment to historic cultural education
The kindle edition is an English language comic
the paperback appears to be an English translation of the Chinese novel
and the hardcover is the original Chinese novel
It is a great book but the font is really small and they printed it wrong so the lines dont align too well  If you want your eyes a little less stressed this isnt the book to get  but plot is great
that depicts the lives of  outlaws I knew all of their names by heart and is supposed to have a negative influence on young boys because of its vivid display of violence and its apology for the overturn of the social order that made it a favorite of Chairman Mao The Three Kingdoms was not available in French at that time I discovered this second classic much later in a Japanese translation
at an age when readers allegedly shouldnt be exposed to its depiction of stratagum
frauds and trickeries that cunning politicians could use to their advantage My dream is that when I reach old age and become conversant enough in Chinese
The historic novel of the three kingdoms was a fantastic read The literary style was
difficult to get used to but the story itself is told in a very straightforward fashion and the characters are very rich The constant turn of events will have you rooting for the splendid victories throughout ShuHans campaigns and lamenting their bitter losses I noticed many typos throughout the entire novel but theyre few and theyre small enough to avoid confusion as you read Overall I think this particular translation was excellent It was recommended to me and I would gladly recommend it to anyone who has an affinity for this great age of chivalrous heroes and tyrannous villains
A most loved collection for our kids growing up Must have for the history buffs and strategy lovers
Best translation ive read This would be the third iteration of this story ive read The names are spelled correctly with grammar and general spelling mistakes being far less in this rendition The books physical quality isnt anything to ride home about Pages wrinkle and warp easily with some text being blurry only a few pages Came with a few pages already wrinkled too Still highly recommended for someone seeking the best translation This one even has a few pictures and maps Get this one for reading and then find some special hardcover run for the shelf if you really like it
but I didnt find it hard to read As for the story itself
keep in mind that this is a book of tremendous historical and cultural importance at least in China If youre reading it because of that
its very good that there are so few typos  Someone remarked that this was not a good version and advised to check your local library  He must not know that this is considered the definitive edition of the book
After falling in love with the movie Red Cliff I discovered that its narrative was based on this classic chinese novel And since this story is so ingrained in the East so as to be part of the culture itself I was determined to ferret out a copy and see for myself This is a huge book
it spans generations and took me months to read My edition was smartly broken up into four books
I appreciate that What I didnt appreciate was at the end of book four is a list of important characters
their descriptions and even a list of titles with definitions How is that offensive Well I sure could have used that while reading books one through three Being a westerner
some of the characters only differ by ONE letter Not to mention most of the main characters have more than one name
used interchangeably There are also a ton of characters
and I look forward to reading it again one day The story itself is impressive with ample amounts of action
I bought it for US  tax excludedbought July    Chinese characters very sharp 
excellent quality in printing Chinese characters  Note  the book used  modern Chinese ie simplified 
not traditional Chinese  paper quality  fair too thin 
but acceptable  The translation by Moss Roberts is excellent His notes at the end of each book is extremely helpful and adequate  I found the following web site s printed at the last page of the book 
but I found the best is of Tu Vi Lang  the Vietnamese version has  at the end of each chapter  the expert commentary by Mao Ton Cuong  a Chinese author   I wrote his name in Vietnamese  Chinese   MaoZonggang   mids   unfortunately these commentaries are not availbale in the above Chinese  English version    I enjoy the commentaries even more than the story itself    For the Vietnamese version 
remembered this as being one of the best books Ive ever read If anybody is interested in reading the Three Kingdoms
this version is THE translation to get And the notes in the back are very useful
The books themselves were in good condition No pages missing
my only fantastic literary claim up to this point was conquering the Harry Potter series Then
I picked up these volumes I was absolutely enthralled I picked up this book because Im a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series In fact
I learned something new about ancient Chinese culture and managed to have a fantastic time doing so I highly recommend this book And as many others have said
do NOT buy the abridged version Spend a little extra and get the four volume set Youll get a lot more out of the reading
Nice books  I am reading along as I watch Chinese TV series on Three Kingdoms  An exciting way to learn about history and Chinese culture
but really this is the best version you can buy unless you learn Chinese and translate it yourself
Great book but poor editing The translations and annotations are good The terrible editing and textual errors make it a hard read
For Americans Is it the correct translation No
as I bought a copy of the original translation
Ordered my complete edition of Three Kingdoms from this seller Was very impressed I got brand new books in a very short time frame
and for a great price
I received a misprint where volume  was just volume  with the volume  binding Luckily the seller was right on top of it  sent me a new copy of volume  with no issues  no headaches It arrived promptly  in one piece The only reason Im giving the series  stars instead of  is due to the heavy ghosting with the text in the books All four volumes seem to suffer from ghosted text  it can get really distracting The text from one side of a page bleeds through very noticeably to the other side which gives me a little bit of a headache when I read for an extended period of time
An exciting if convoluted novel depicting an epic period of chaos in Ancient China This novel is wonderfully translated
and I cant imagine that was an easy job Also includes helpful footnotes
I have read and enjoyed Three Kingdoms for over  years  I recently reordered this version because my last edition was getting worn  This Moss Roberts translation is the best English translation of Three Kingdoms on the market
interesting historical information for anyone who enjoys the period  This is the only edition of Three Kingdoms I would purchase or recommend for an English speaking audience
My favorite work of Chinese literature
to become familiar with a Chines literature classic
Great quality Great price Highly recommended for anyone learning Mandarin or wanting some classic Chinese literature
The book shipped quickly and was in good condition It comes in  volumes in a box The page length is very long
and the paper is the same type of paper than youll find in many bibles thin
but good This story is one that should be read and appreciated more widely
I first became intrigued with the Three Kingdomss historical events when I played the game Dynasty Warriors  for PS Afterwards I was desperately searching to find the best novel translation and finally bought the volume box set translated by Moss Roberts which is the UNABRIDGED versionmake sure to get this edition as it tells the whole story wo leaving anything outI then set out to explore the  pages of Chinese history and I must say
it was a fascinating experience I initially grasped what was going to happen in time but there was so much other details to the story and idealisms portrayed Leadership
and even romance play such a significant role in this epic novel The empire long united
must unite pretty much opens and closes the novel perfectly Heroes such as Guan Yu
most people think Liu Bei Xuande is the protaganist of the novel and this seems very true since Roberts lauds Beis characteristics and portrays Cao Cao of the evil and cunning type Personally
I think anyone can choose their personal protaganist and for me that would be Zhao Yun because of his undisputed bravery and loyalty Another character that I admired was probably Zhuge Liang for his aweaspiring military tactics Zhuge was the best strategist of his time and he wrote several books on warfare but unfortunately
most were destroyed but you can still buy one of his famous books
spoiler ahead   This book has its sad moments particularly when someone important or someone who contributed a lot to his lord dies Youll feel sympathetic towards those who fought hard as well as the ones who died When the book starts
and Wei Its sort of like a battle to the death of who would emerge victorious and indeed there was Military tactics are exploited on each side and betrayal is widespread In the end
but this epic is a masterpiece of literature in any language  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the classics of world literature
Really wanted this as I only had Volumes I and II  Much more accessible than earlier BrewittTaylor translation  If you liked Red Cliffs short or  dvd international version  youd enjoy this
The books arrived promptly and in excellent condition I was pleasantly surprised to find the character drawings
the story itself is an entertaining read Highly recommended
Very good translation of the original novel
If youre into classical Chinese literature
My son loved this book He plays Koeis Dynasty Warriors series and he fell in love with this book I read a little bit of it and I am rather fond of it too I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good action book about unification of the land This book has not left out a single detail about the story
The writing doesnt flow very well but the story is very enjoyable
Its like I never stop turning the page when I read this  Truly amazing
It is interesting to see what was going on in the ancient worlds other great empire at the same time that Rome was entering its century of chaos
I wanted to get acquainted with the original story Id originally found a free copy hosted online
but that copy was of an early th century translation and the antiquated language was often difficult to parse The Moss Roberts translation has been considerably easier to read frequent spelling errors notwithstanding
Three Kingdoms is a amazing volume which mixes history with mythlogy during the three kingdom period of chinas past It really is a great story The only bad part is that this volume seems like a rough draft There are literally tons of spelling errors and misuse of english language Obviously they should have put more effort into translating this better for the english audience And the price of  is a bit hefty for  paperback books I would look for a different translation for a cheaper buy
The story is very extensive
though having some grammar and spelling errors the four volumes story is an excellent read
A timeless piece of literature Capture the history of the Han Dynasty in a most intriguing tale where ideals and ambitions collide
Three Kingdoms is one of the most important works of Chinese literature The story itself is there
but the ridiculous number of grammatical and spelling errors throughout the volume set can spoil the experience just a bit
My best friend from America had wishes for this series
Three Kingdoms is a action packed novel that deserves to be called a classic  Nevertheless all the Chinese names and the repetitive battle scenes could easly lose the novice reader after the first thousand pages or so  If you buy this be prepared to read the footnotes throughly and become a student of Chinese culture
Got all my books and they were in good condition Nuff said
This history has a superb drama and excelent descriptions of the battles of old China Recommended for those whom like a good plot
This novel is absolutely fabulous I recommend the tv serie which is really close to this novel Romance of the three kingdoms  
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is possibly the most famous and important novel in classic Chinese literature  Not only is it the earliest of the Four Great Books as evidenced by its more archaic language
still know the characters from the strategy and fighting video games released by the company Koei  And how many literary works can claim to have had a direct impact on history as this book
which was used as a strategy text by the great Manchurian leader Nurhachi and his son Hongtaiji Id read the original archaic text when I was about eight years old
so obviously my views will be heavily slanted by my familiarity with this text  On approaching this translation
respectful and informative translation that doesnt quite nail the tone of the original text
but will be a good read for modern readers who dont read Chinese And to be honest
Chinese is extremely hard to translate into English  Just the fact that subjects
and it could not have been easy for translator Moss Roberts to adapt this style into English  And he has done the job remarkably
for though I dont think he was able to convey the flavour and rhythm of the original language the question is
his translation makes a good read
and strives to be faithful to the original text
down to the chapter divisions and the inclusion of the tribute poems which frequent the book  This was an essential piece in the style of the book and I was joyed to see the device retained There are instances scattered throughout where I felt the tone of the language may have been misinterpreted
in the original text
one poem on the character Cao Cao distinctly used a word which meant deception or guile
which suggests a tactical manoeuvre related to geography  These are but two examples and you can certainly argue that the meaning of the original text is up for grabs
but as a Chinese native speaker and reader
I still find the translation a little off  There is also no attempt at creating period flavour in the language  the translation is modern
not aiming to add archaic English flavour to try to reflect the age of the original Chinese text  This may be a good point
since the use of archaic English added to the language barrier might have resulted in a book thats very difficult to read  I think Prof Roberts sacrificed flavour for clarity
a fair tradeoff to the benefit of the translation Again
the question is whether an English translation or any other translation could ever be accurate in this way to the original  Personally
for a reader whos never read the original
this issue wont affect hisher enjoyment of the text  Just the fact that there is a translation of this extremely important work of Chinese literature is a cause for celebration
this set of books is a great discovery
The package arrived very quickly and in perfect condition  It was a gift for my son  Hes enthralled by the story  Moss is an excellent translator
Very good quality compare to the price
writing and research are great Only complaint is that comers of the books came are bent and damaged
the actual books were fantastic Moss Roberts translation is simply wonderful however
the packaging was damaged so completely that the books were warped almost to the point of disfigurement quite a shame considering how wonderful the actual text is
Exactly what expected and really happy for the purchase
Great books in perfect conditions I recommend everyone to read this series
This is the most difficult to read book I have ever read I mean this literally I am not talking about the reading level or the quality of the translation The pages are the thinnest I have ever seen in a book You can clearly see the text from the other pages quite clearly The low contrast makes the page literally difficult to read I know they did this to cut costs
but this is stupid if you cant even read the book I would have rather paid an extra  to  dollars for some thicker pages and an extra volume Try and find a better version if you can
This is what I was promised Condition New BRAND NEW,GOOD QUALITY AND FAST DELIVERY ALL HAVE FREE TRACKING NUMBER WITH REGISTERED What I really get is a broken case
and two of the volumes are not in a good condition Still the inside is good and the product is what I asked for So the books are apparently not new
or the delivery is of a very bad quality Also I had some problems with the delivery at first
and he solved the problems quick and efficiently I would recommend this seller and the product
but I would care to ask for a good condition of the product before i ask for it
the item is listed as a Box Set in good condition but i did not get the box to hold them in and the condition was  so it was less then what i expected but i know the books themselves are a good read
The delivery was pretty speedy Little damage to the side of the book I would have preferred it to be shipped in a box instead of a bag but got here fine with minimum damage
The longlived Han dynasty is finally succumbing to effects of a weak Emperor and corrupt government that is cause injustice throughout China resulting peasant revolts while nobles strive to reform the court  Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong
dramatizes the year history of the end of the Han dynasty as the empire divided into the titular three kingdoms before being reunified under the Jin while being true to history for nearly the entire text The weakness of the Emperor Ling and his corrupt court results in the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Emperor asks all loyal subjects to come to arms to fight the rebels  Among that answering the call is Liu Bei
and Sun Jian an accomplished general  The numerous warlords crush the rebellion but remain in charge of various districts when the Emperor dies thus setting the stage for the warlords vying for power by controlling the child Emperor and then his young brother when Lings immediate successor is deposed then murdered  Sun Jian heads to the Southlands and founds a dynasty that is cemented by his son Ce that eventually becomes the Kingdom of Wu  Cao Caos Machiavellian political acumen and military success results in him getting control of the last Han Emperor
and control of the northern heartland that eventually becomes the Kingdom of CaoWei  Liu Bei and his sworn brothers bouncing from district and district trying to restore the independence and good governance of the Han but the warlords that they serve under continue to fight for their own power  Then the brotherhood is joined by a militarypolitical advisor Kongming that uses Beis connection to the Imperial house to establish power in the Riverlands
the Sima family rises within the ranks of the CaoWei that they eventually usurp and reunify the Empire as the Jin dynasty Though Luo Guanzhong wrote his masterpiece roughly  years after the events of the novel
he used extensive historical records plus numerous legends and popular stories from the period to enhance Three Kingdoms  The resulting novel is considered seven parts history and three parts fiction
the later portions surround the adventures and actions of Lord Guan and Kongming respectfully whose impact on history was either enlarger or their effectiveness increased  On top of that Luo Guanzhong
had a political agenda to favor Liu Bei over Cao Cao that giving the former great virtue while the latter is considered a usurper  The fourvolume page novel is an engaging piece of historical fiction with a lot of annotation
though it isnt perfect  From the text itself
there are hundreds of named characters though most of them are minor characters that are hard to keep straight through the major and secondary characters are easy to keep straight  The Chinese name convention of surname given name is followed throughout and after a while its easy to get use to however one of Luo Guanzhongs decisions was to have some individuals have multiple names
most notably Liu Bei Xuande and Kongming Zhuge Liang that at times confuses the reader  The majority problem with the novel is unfortunately the Foreign Language Press edition that I read had grammatical and spelling errors on almost every page that too be fair was easy to read through but was a tad annoying Three Kingdoms is a Chinese historical classic novel that I found to be a very readable novel thanks to the true to original translation approach of Moss Roberts that gave Luo Guanzhongs masterpiece its full meaning  Though most of my issues are due to the publishers grammatical and spelling errors
they didnt takeaway from the great historical story that was presented and gives the reader an insight into Chinese history and cultural thought
misleading web page lead to a  penalty charge
The cover of the book showing a bunch of giggling morons is enough to warn any serious reader that it is nothing but a collection of childish cartoons
not was i was hoping for  so many names after name  like a chronology and not like a great flowing story
comparing it word for word with a Japanese translation of the original medieval Chinese The original language is hard to read
but Roberts nails it I believe it will be hard to surpass the accuracy of this translation The Beijing edition
contains all of the useful footnotes available in the UC Press edition
and relatively few typos This classic epic novel is wellknown to almost all educated people in East Asia
it is more engaging and thoughtinspiring than a hundred books of political philosophy Run
though somewhat daunted by the size I did expect the book to be interesting
but I also thought it would be difficult reading Little did I expect for the book to far exceed my expectations The Three Kingdoms is a fascinating look into the history albeit somewhat fictionalized of China during a roughly  year period between  AD
during which the Han Dynasty fellthe Han was the longest lasting and most powerful dynasty according to the Afterword The book is full of stories of honor
although battle is featured prominently in the bookit spends equal or greater amounts of time peering into the political intrigue
which presents probably the greatest challenge to a Western reader Learning the names of the main characters might come easier than you might think
and there is a helpful list of main characters in the back of the fourth volume though even many of those listed there appear only momentarily in the novel I would also suggest reading the foreward and at least the beginning of the afterword in the fourth volume before beginning the bookit will give helpful background information The storytelling in the Three Kingdoms is so compelling that I often found myself practically cheering for my favorite characters
and often laughing out loud at peculiar victories or witty dialogue The beginning of the book focuses on Liu Bei Xuande a man of admirable character and virtue
who is Liu Beis military strategist Kongming is definitely the most fascinating character
and his strategies and manipulation are delightful to watch unfold The book also has scores of heroes and villains
and gives insight into the values and virtues that were highly regarded by the Chinese Towards the end of the book the storyline briefly begins to sag as most of the main characters die off
and still carry on the suspense and excitement that was stronger and brighter in the first ths of the novel All in all I was disappointed when I finished
ONLY because there wasnt more to read I would definitely read this book again and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a true epic of Chinese history
but has many fictitious moments This is my personal favorite set of books I chose my major because of this work Moss Roberts does a fantastic translation of a literary work that has helped shape China The book opens with Liu Xuande Liu Bei
both militaristic and political with many vying for power
with an unlikely force winning In the end
which greatly help in understanding the flow and historical background of the work
an amazing translation of an amazing historic
is extremely accurate and reads excellently and fluently  Roberts finds a middle ground between fidelity and spirit  The language used is not archaic
yet the translation is faithful  It remains one of the best translated texts of Chinese literature ever  Roberts must be congratulated for translating a book that reads as well as it did in the original written six centuries ago Trouble is
 years after the most ancient extant text was established
the differences between the s Mao edition and  Jiajing Renwu Tongsu edition in an informative afterword  Roberts said that the differences and literary merits were disputed amongst scholars  But for people wanting to read a version truer to Luo Guanzhongs vision
should we be reading the Maos revision of the original novel in c 
or Luos own written around   There are people who advocated the Mao version as the superior
more literary edition  This is no different from scholars who used to edit Shakespeare to make him more palatable to the tastes of their times What the Maos did was to add their own judgments to the text  Luos TS version of  paints a more accurate historical version of the characters
from the historical annals Sanguo Zhi  Some people may argue the characters might be drier
Liu Bei the embodiment of righteous dynastic rule Guang Yu and Zhuge Liang were deified  They divided the book into  chapters the TS version was in  scrolls and  parts each ie  parts The Maos changed  of the text  The effect is cumulative in such a long work as Three Kingdoms  The characterizations are changed quite drastically To Roberts credit
he does provide footnotes where the  revised edition differs from the  version  He is right too that the Maos edition remains the most printed and read version in China
the s version isnt that bad  Its an embellished version
must divide isnt in the older version  But since the  edition almost definitely represent Luos work more faithfully
readers should have their selection  Since Professor Shen Bojuns magisterial edition of the Jiajing Renwu version appeared nearly two decades ago which corrects technical errors
the task shouldnt be that arduous   of the text is already in the s version  Voice of hope
however idealistic give us the Jiajing Renwu version and the Sanguo Zhi the full historical annals please
Imagine my surprise when my eleven year old son placed a few names from a video game Dynasty Warriors into Google and came up with biographies of real Chinese warlords Investigating I found that the game was based on Chinese Literature
a historical book written in the s about rd Century China by Luo Guanzhong My son promised he would read the book if I ordered it The book as ordered is printed in China and is broken into four  page sections I did buy it and with his background from the game he sailed through all  sections in record time with nothing but high praise I have read it myself and highly recommend it to anyone We have also purchased the TV serialized DVD collection
which is absolutely facinating viewing for those who have read the original books The DVDs require staying power there are  of them put out by Chinese government TV studios The recording quality and the subtitle errors are a bit of a deterent to all but real Three Kingdom Fans If you are expecting a slick Hollywood film dont buy the DVDs
And its about time too Moss Roberts does an excellent job of translating the epic novel by Luo Guanzhong in a full
unabridged four book series Previously I had read an abridged version by the selfsame translator
and while I was impressed with the story
or San Guo Yan Yi This period chronicles the decline of the Han to the rise of the Jin dynasty circa AD  The story tells the tale of protagonist Zhuge Liang referred to as Kongming throughout the story and his efforts to help his lord Liu Bei referred to as Xuande throughout the story unite the land and restore the crumbling Han You see
Liu Bei is a distant cousin of the child emperor
but his importance is immeasurable This story is a mustread for history fans as well as fans of any of the video game series about the time period Dynasty Warriors
etc Fans of the video game series will love to hear tales of their favorite characters
Zhao Yun and many more An important thing to keep in mind when reading Luo Guanzhongs novel is that it is a biased account of the events Luo Guanzhong is what I call a proShuist
Wu might be frustrated as many of their favorite characters will not be viewed as positively as they may deserve to be With this in mind
read and will keep you turning the pages The story isnt terribly difficult to follow but some may have trouble keeping track of the cast of characters some  plus characters in all and all of their names What I mean by all of their names is that the chinese had the surname Zhuge
at any rate My major complaint with this edition and it is minor is the poor proofreading and the poor quality of the paper and binding This book was published to Beijing standards and would not meet American standards You will have to be a little careful with the book while reading it
but thats not too big of a problem Also
the typos two or three a chapter can get annoying and make you wonder who was proofreading the book and make you think that you could do a better job and you probably could That aside
this is a very enjoyable story and you will not be disappointed in buying the fourvolume unabridged set translated by Moss Roberts
but its more fun than almost any five novels you could choose The epic sweep through  years of Chinese history is amazing The narrative is swift and compelling The battles are spectacular and exciting The charactersespecially Kongming
and lacks the qualities needed in an epic hero Its hard to see what the other characters saw in him
Like many people I first heard of this novel through the games from Koei I played romance of the three kingdoms on my Nintendo when I was in high school A few years ago I started playing the dynasty warriors series of games on the playstation I had always wanted to read the novel
and Im glad I did The story starts around  AD
and finally to the reunification of china around  The principle characters are rulers
it really didnt take that long to read It is interesting and something is always going on I dont think I would have enjoyed being a third century Chinese general They have a pretty short life It was kind of sad when character that I really like got killed
but considering the time span of the novel it was bound to happen The novel does focus on the time period from 
after that things start going pretty quick and after  AD the story is essentially over
culture and just plain swashbuckling fun For the translator
it is a work of a lifetime  this comes from an amateur sinologist who remains daunted by the original texts of works such as Three Kingdoms Roberts joins David Hawkes in the alltime Chinese translation hall of fame For those interested in an introduction to the drama and adventure that provide the framework for Chinese thinking about large issues such as nationbuilding and nationdestroying
this is the ultimate guidebook Long before Gibbon wrote the Decline and Fall  and Asimov wrote the Foundation series
the Chinese were obsessed with the process of dynastic change and transformation in their own country It is impossible to overstate the role of this work in Chinese culture  it is as if everyone in the West actually grew up reading  and loving  the Iliad and the Odyssey In the sweep of history
the personal is not lost Personalities large and small march across the scene and the reader is swept up in their strivings to find a place and something to strive for as the structure of the world turns upside down For the great Han Dynasty is falling
who play a significant role of cruelty and vision emerge to strive in a chaotic arena
seeking to make their mark on the new order to come In this sense
but this is one of the bejewelled versions Roberts translation is accompanied by extensive endnotes
the translator has done a tremendous job of translating the poetry in the book  often used to eulogize heroes and martyrs who give their lives out of loyalty to their leaders or who go down fighting in a losing cause These bits of verse help to cast the necessary sense of the futility of human strivings which pervades this work and the Chinese sensibility generally The heroes see their own deeds as tiny drops in a great river of history
you have to read the full translation of this book  I read the  abridged version of Three Kingdoms translated by Moss Roberts first and thought it was pretty good
but felt that the story wasnt developed  enough and lacked cohesion  Then a few years ago I finally found and  purchased the full unabridged version published by the University of  California Press and also translated by Dr Roberts  This is the  fullblown epic from start to finish with all the details and many of the  translation errors of the previous editions eliminated  The prose was also  improved and flows eloquently throughout the books entire  pages  Three Kingdoms is the tale part historical
part legend and myth of the  fall of the Later Han Dynasty of China  It chronicles the lives of those  feudal lords and their retainers who tried to either replace the empire or  restore it  While the novel actually follows literally hundreds of  characters
personal and army battles
and struggles of these  families to achieve dominance for almost  yrs  This book also gives you  a sense of the way the Chinese view their history  cyclical rather than  linear as in the West  The first and last lines of the book sum this  view up best The empire long united must divide and  The empire long divided must unite If you are at least a  little interested in Chinese history ancient or modern and culture this  book is a must read
When I first read Three Kingdoms it was quite a confusing story
what with all the endless characters that came and went
despite the very basic narrative style being hundreds of years old and the fairly simple way it must have been translated With the amount of trials and tribulations that the reader witnesses in following the extremely incredible characters
it is no wonder that these real people from history mean so much to people today
you are really drawn into a whole new world To follow the struggles of men like Guan Yu
each having their own story to contribute to this immortal saga It is truly a credit to Luo Guanzhong the way he managed to interweave so many storys
and yet stay prevalently factual If you can get past the confusion and the slight redundancy of the narrative style
there is a new version of Three Kingdoms that is to be released soon
designed to be more entertaining and less confusing than the  year old original Apparently it will still contain all of the wisdom from Luo Guanzhongs
and are in many ways equal or even better than Three KingdomsRomance of Three Kingdoms
I bought the book with some background of the subjects so I had a good idea of what it would be like It is written differently than most American writers style
which may be weird to somebody that does not realize how authentic the subject and writing actually is The book is very detailed and for anyone that loves Chinese history of the  AD period
this book will give you a good description of it The characterization and background of the main parties is very indepth and you get a great idea of the temperaments for all the main characters What keeps me from giving this a  star rating is that some words are missed due to translation errors
characters and overall cultural depictions
Last year a friend of mine recommended this masterpiece of Roberts to me to sharpen my English and I found its a masterwork as excellent as that of the original author about  years ago Its said that the literature works belong to their own ethnic groups
not only the surface meaning but also the deep meaningthe meaning in English is just the same as that in Chinese
no more and no less If a Chinese author translated this middleages novel to modern Chinese as Prof Roberts to modern English
he can do no more and better than Prof Roberts  years ago as a boy I read this Chinese epic of Luoguan Zhong but ignored the last  chapters whose content is about how traitor overwhelmed loyalists and not political correct But this English version read I from the st word to the last word including the annotation which contains many Chinese history events and lores even common Chinese dont know The shortcoming of this translation is to nonChinese readers
especially the English name of the peopleplace in this history fiction I think western readers will be easily confused because when  years ago I firstly read this book I was also confused except tens of the main roles But the translation of title is so cool kautsuthe earliest ancestor of this dynasty and taitsuwuhugdithe st emperor and the founder of this dynasty with many martial merits is translated to Augustusthe only and very  correct translation I think In Chinese books about Julius Caesar Augustus in Rome history
this is a great one  Guanzhong based his novel on solid historical facts while adding some fictional elements in order to bring out the characters and events for the reader  Ive heard it said
that it is  history and  fiction  Addtionally
the other reviews probably say enough about the Three Kingdoms for me not to repeat them  I came to this novel after playing the old Koei games
and I loved reading it My only problem with the box set is that the books format seemed very poor to me  After paying  bucks with shipping
with a very very small typeset on filmy paper that is very easy to smudge and smear  Also
you might want to wait until a much higher class version comes out than the one from the university press I got
This book is a truly epic tale of ancient civilization It is a historical fiction of roughly  AD the period of the fall of the Han dynasty
with Liu Bei and Peach Garden brothers set as the heros The plot of this  page tale centers around the political and military exploits of various leaders of the age The dissolving the dynastic rule
and the subsequent consolidation into three major kingdoms The story telling is superb
and for thematically bonding disparate events and characters The story also mixes in many different observations into the nature of morality
the footnotes are helpful for understanding the historical allusions and identifying where the fiction differs from history This printing has a fair number of typos
which made it much easier to comprehend The storyline is an adventure
and the end of the ThreeKingdom dynasty Lots of symbolism and fables to be interpreted Very thoughtful and comprehensive
and numerous Gods to be worshiped It is one of the greatest classics in the world
You should Three Kingdoms is the number  bestseller in the history of mankind after King James Bible Couple billion readers cannot be wrong so have your faith in this book Three Kingdoms I read it about  times now Everytime I read it
I learn something new or see a different point of view according to my own maturity You can talk about Tolkien
get ready to immerse yourself in epic that is equal to none You have just found the book of your dreams
I decided to go to the main source  the novel While reading the novel
or the battle with the strongest man under heaven are
The story itself is amazing
the translation lively and I like that it had little pictures once in a while to give me a picture in my head of what these characters looked like HOWEVERThere are quite a few spelling mistakes
and mixed up letters b,d and p,q  I bought a set directly from China so Im not sure if the edition for sale in North America has these flaws  They dont cause any major comprehension problems
I got this a while ago and it was a great read if you have ever played any of the dynasty warriors games you might want to check this set out it is a good deal dont miss out on it
I first was introduced to this story by first playing the the game Dynasty Warrriors  for Playstaion  Even though I am not finished with the three volumes so far it has been excellent and very detailed for an a historical story that happened about two millenia ago  I am now on the second volume and wont stop till I get to the end One thing about these books is that it is very difficult readed and not that easy to follow at times because the names of the people can get confusing the chinese has their names
last name first and given names following and also the people in this story sometimes are called by a second name which is common in the chinese culture  One would have to read these books at least two more times after the first to get the story down because according to my mother my grand father had read the same story in China and told my mom that he had to read it a few times to fully understand this complex time in the history of prefeudal China and a story still being studied militarily and historically to this day  In a nutshell dispite the difficult read and complex story which I found to a challenge it is excellent and did not before starting expect it ot be easy
is excellent for someone who wants to be challenged whether or not they have played the game or who just is intrigued by an important time in the history of China  It is good for people just learning about this country or for some who like me have played the game and is caught by the intriguing story that the game was based on
I must submit a brief warning   If you possess the attention span of a five year old
Wei and Shu   From the rout of the Yellow Scarves in the opening scenes of the novel to the fall of Wu and the unification of the Empire over a hundred years later
intricately weaving the clash and bloodshed of battle with the scheming and intrigue that fills the tales early pages This is a blend of fiction and fact
so Luo Guanzhong does not have the ability to twist the plot in any one direction though Liu Bei emerges as a hero to Cao Caos brutal villainand so some of the lesser fights are told matteroffactly   However
the colorful picture that the author paints of palace life  that keeps it fresh
and wipes away the dryness that fills other legends While Jiang Weis endless string of defeats at the end of the novel appears to grow old
I purchased this novel because of the addictive Playstation  games put out by Koei that are based on the Three Kingdoms story and characters  Even being relatively familiar with the characters and plot
I found the novel to be very difficult to digest
and this is an excellent novel  This version is very helpful due to extensive endnotes and a preface and afterword that fleshes out the background and meaning of the novel  I would recommend it to anyone whos interested in political and military adventures
It is an excellent novel and the translation is great When I read the story
the Chinese history would have a new twist if Emperor Xian had used Li Xuande to protect the Han dynasty  Sum it up
the reasons or culprits that led to the collapse of the Han dynasty or any other dynasties later in Chinese history were due a weak ruler
or Li Xuande or Sun Quan as the three main characters in the story of the three kingdoms that fought against one another
several drawings and some maps The edition was very carefully done About the content
I just can say that it is a monumental painting of humanity made through the light of a very difficult time in China history One hint at the end of volume four
a list of principal characters is included
was controling the Emperor like a puppet Him and his mighty step son
I dont want to leave a long comment because the truth is the book is a great classic My only problem with it has been constant grammar errors Once Lord Guan Yu is referred to as Lory Guan Yu
so I will say that I wish the editor would have done a better job with the errors
are prime for my reading list but as a general novel I found this book lacking  This is probably because it is translated but I found this book to be choppy as well as lacking in descriptive writing  Sword fights between two major figures last for one or two sentences max  There arent any vivid descriptions of anything  Im not someone who needs two pages describing a flower the worst case of long unnecessary description Ive come across
I think  kingdoms is a different type of novel from the Western traditional style It doesnt focus much on the personal of characterstheir feeling ,thoughts because it has to deal with hundreds of themThe book itself is a page turner 
 mythsThe main character is considered Kongming Kongming 
a brilliant military leader and politican ,but his talent was exaggerated in the book
in formal history ,his main credit was to save the kingdom of Shu from the Weis menace Sima Yi this man is a master schemer,a superb politican and military leader  Sima did not want a total war with the Shu because as long as Kongming ramained a menace to  Wei kingdom 
and Mao ZeDong writes poems to praise him Cao Cao was extremely suspicious  I would rather betrayed the world than have the world betrayed me A good comapre to Cao is Stalin
and Guillivers Travels  None of these is as readily accessible to younger readers as this set of books is  There is more action in one page of this book than any book Ive read before  And similarly
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is my favorite Chinese literature This is one of the best classics in Chinese history This  volume set tells you one of the bloodiest war in ancient China This is a MUST READ if you are into Chinese classics From the uprising of Shu
The title of this review truly says it all for this martial epic One would not make an overstatement by comparing this bbok to such powerful works of literature as the iliad or the nibelungEverything from characters to plot is richly portrayedCharacters are epic and complex and he storyline is iaginative and rich The only chinese novel that cann supposedly surpass this book is The Dream of the red chamber and I cant wait to read it
Having read both the original Chinese text and Mr Roberts accurate translation
the English version unfortunately does not capture the essence in which the Odyssey of China rose to its widespread fame and ubiquity It lacks the characterstics that demand to stand as one of the greatest historical and legendary pieces in existence today That is why it is literature
not simply history The artistic hand of Luo Guanzhong is almost wiped off and a bland history with awkward word choice is left that leaves little to imagination and wonder For people who are interested in the epics of Chinese literature
to gain a simple understanding of the events and perhaps some of the strategies
to truly appreciate the epic that has created sayings that if you read the story three times
another case of great literature unable to be shared since it was lost in translation
These books are telling a story about what happened in the late Han Dinasty Full of dramatic event
magnificent stategems implemented and actually fun to read as long as you have stamina to do it since it is a really thick for every volume
probably the most popular novel in china 
maybe the greatest book i have ever known Seeing  some reviews said that Liu Bei is the main hero of the novel ,in China we disliked and considered him a man who know nothing but cry and a demagogue  the  most fascinating character must be Cao Cao 
and even the famous seven battle of Kong Ming with the barbarian ,of which he captured the rebels leader ,realesed him ,and then recaptured Even with the best translator there are still some  poems
I am a normal  year old boy who likes china  And let me tell you somthing this book is the best book ever It has a huge stand point on war and art This book is the Unabriged version and has a lot of names but you will get the main people in the story For any of you who have played the viedo game
and situation of China around  to  AD You will find yourself reading the first chapter and not wanting to stop The epic book does well by hooking the reader in   However
The story gets Five stars But the quality of the books gets a Three or Four The pages are really thin and there are a lot words that are spelled incorrectly Thankfully
but having to solve the occasional word puzzle in the middle of the story can be quite annoying This is still one of the greatest stories ever written and an excellent buy
The Three Kingdoms is set right at the end of the Han dynasty and covers more than a century when the unity of China was broken  Moss Roberts has done a good job translating this vigorous history of alliances
and greed  It isnt exactly a historical novel as there are many supernatural elements
This Book is one of the best books ever you know Since i got the games by koei man I know alot about what happens in the game and I got a EnglishKoreanchineseJapanese translated thats how much i like the book It my ship like in  weekswell on a scale of  i give it a Seehow good it isI dont Like reading only games but this book i read about  times it sooo gooooddddd
This is definitely good book for people who want to learn history of china and from this book
The book is set an ancient china from ad to ad or something like that the reason i got into this is because of Koeis Dynasty Warriors series especially  It has political features and also has a bunch of betrayals
I am a big fan of The Three Kingdoms saga  I wanted a version that in my mind was worthy of the wonder and significance of the work  This version
and I must say that this version does not live up to expectations  I see typographical and spelling  errors on seemingly every other page  There are also numerous references within the text to other works and versions that make me think there have to be more comprehensive
and this one isnt it  If you are new to the ROTK world
The post office lost the original order
until I contacted Amazon They not only fixed the problem they did it almost instantly
I want to make it clear that I respect the people who love and enjoy this novel I do not think that their opinion of it is somehow wrong The following
this novel is one of the least accessible to the average Englishspeaking reader The way in which the story is told is extremely dry and downright baffling to someone schooled in Western literature The writing had no emotional resonance ever The lack of emotional resonance is expected
seeing as theres very little description of anything beside physical occurrences
which are summarized in very succinct form ie Character  stabbed Character 
it reads like a reference work Its not a novel as most western readers would be accustomed to thinking of one Even if youre open to forms of literature that are drastically different from anything else youve read as I was
youll probably find yourself too exasperated by the novel to finish It was really a painful experience for me However
all is not lost for the person seeking an entry into Chinese literature I recommend Dream of the Red Chamber as a good starting novel
which makes it more relevant to the modern history and identity of the region we know as China Those looking for older quality pieces of writing from East Asia as a whole may enjoy The Tale of Genji and The Tale of the Heike more than they would enjoy Three Kingdoms Both Genji and Heike are lengthy novels of Japanese origin
seller worked with me in a calm and speedy manner while thanksgiving was going on to resolve a shipping issue product arrived very fast and in great condition
One of the greatest book of Chinese literature
good books
Im assuming anyone interested enough to read through reviews of Three Kingdoms needs no convincing in terms of the story itself It is
a superb epic and more than worth anyones time of which you will need a lot if you are to finish it In light of this
my review will focus specifically on Moss Robertss unabridged edition of Three Kingdoms To anyone wondering whether to go with BrewettTaylors s translation or this one
Moss Roberts translation uses the all but universally adopted system of Pinyin
the language is far more accessible in the Moss Roberts version This is not to say that it is dumbed down  quite the contrary The translations of the poems and couplets are beautifully rendered and capture the emotional tone conveyed in the original Chinese very well they even rhyme most of the time Lastly
this revised edition contains a long list of vital characters
does a great job of contextualising the novel in terms of its place in Chinese culture and historiography It sorts fact from fiction
for anyone interested in the historical aspect of the novel it is
a romanticised and often fictionalised account of the period These three facts alone place the updated Moss Roberts edition far above BrewettTaylors in my opinion Nevertheless
you heard me The spoilers While the introduction and the footnotes do a superb job of clarifying
they are also often guilty of revealing the turn of events long before the reader has got to that part of the story Thus
I cannot fathom why he would deem it appropriate or even necessary to reveal such things to the reader without warning him first I suppose this was published before the phrase spoiler alert was coined I would therefore be inclined to recommend that readers who wish to remain unspoiled avoid the introduction and the footnotes sections altogether However
given how useful the footnotes actually are for the most part in terms of aiding the reader through esoteric references to historical figures
and yet they ultimately rob the reader of the pleasure of being surprised at crucial points in the story However
I still loved Moss Robertss edition Its easy to tell how enamoured and engrossed he was by this story
and his passion shines through in this beautiful translation
but Im still glad I did There are  volumes in a slightly flimsy cardboard cover to keep them together The pages themselves are extremely thin paperthin
but even though I traveled a fair amount with some of these books stuffed in a bag
the pages never got ripped etc The pages maybe need to be this thin so that the books arent ridiculously thick There are some pictures and maps in the books
but I didnt use them that much You will need a second bookmark so that you can refer to the footnotes at the back of the book that are constant throughout the books Often these footnotes give an alternative translation from another source
and you need a reminder of who they are The translation seems pretty coherent at least
but certainly doesnt portray the poetic nature of the original Chinese At the time I bought this
there was one other translation version that the reviews said is more poetic I think it has actually been uploaded to read for free online
a partly fictional account of the events leading up to the transition from the Han Empire to the Jin Empire in China during the last part of the rd Century  The story is
an iconic tale
and the breadth of characters and affiliations in the era is so great that it was inevitable  in addition to bias  that the carriers of the tale would caricature most of it to create a simple good vs evil tale  So
once the several hundred pages of setup are complete  which is good in itself
valiant Lu Bu and arrogant Yuan Shao  the story turns into a struggle between the virtuous Liu Bei
and the opportunistic Sun Quan  But its the supporting cast that really make the story work the iconic Guan Yu and Zhao Zilong
the style may be uncomfortable not to me personally
to anyone not interested in Chinese culture
as all of the main characters are no longer present for whatever reason  Repetition is something else I hear aimed at this novel well
part of the point the novel makes
and I even understand theres a graphic novel version if you know where to look Either way
I bought this set of books a while ago because they looked interesting I am also a huge fan of the war which happened in China as I played the Dynasty Warriors franchise from number  and have watched the red cliff films which are about the war This book is well written and tells the war the right way which is very interesting and amazing to read A truly inspirational book as it brings together different types of character and you see what way they approach the war and deal with it
This set of books is defiantly worth the buy if youre into Chinese history and its ancient tales However
i only give  stars to this product overall simply because the box the four books come in is very thin and not very well made
but worth it D Just be careful when reading not to tare pages 
This isnt the full version Its a stupid comic book despite the description saying its the full book
Often the narrative is a little unusual when put into the modern context but if you have a love of history
A huge novel
Delivery was timely  Book was in good condition
but I underestimate the difficulty in reading such small print in a tight format The print was much too close to the spine to properly pick out the last words of a line The book is much needed
so I ordered a more readable format
I am just one of the many people who enjoyed reading the Three Kingdoms What I have to mention however is the terrifying amount of spelling mistakes and the bad overall quality of printing To give you one of many examples In Volume  about one quarter of the text section on a certain page was completely missing Soon afterwards I discovered that lost part printed over the lines of the next page Those pages were completely incomprehensibleI might just have had bad luck with my copy
A very good translation
the history facts are present and you can learn a lot in the department of human behavior and interactions
I can say that for the price the quality is good indeed The paper of the pages is thin but nevertheless it feels good to read Actually it has its good points because the Novel is quite long and like this it doesnt take up much space That is helpful when you  like me  are a person who still likes to carry real books everywhere you go All in all thumbs up
its one of the greatest chinese novels It should be a must read It arrived in one day in good condition
detailed history and reads like a dream A must for anyone interested in China
this version has an issue making a segment of the story unreadable Pages  are completely blank
but this misfortune thoroughly ruined a good book for me A smaller annoyance is the fact that the pages are so thin that the text from the other pages leak through quite easily
One of the best translations of a wonderful classic I really love Three Kingdoms novel and is the third time Im reading it
One of the best books evera masterpiece I really recommend it The translation is quite good indeed A perfect 
This was exactly as ordered This version is the correct and true interpretation of the original books Very pleased
The delivery has been fast and punctual The collection is in very good conditions I recommend to use their services
This is a semihistorical epic set about  years ago
telling of the growth of factionalisation and political intrigue in China that resulted in outright war Essentially this is a story of a number of heroic figures and the battles they wage with each other The main characters are pretty interesting
particularly the deviously clever Cao Cao But the story lacks the fantastical element of Outlaws of the Marsh Vol  
or indeed its humour Its certainly a more challenging read The notes to the edition are excellent
so if you want to know about the history of this period and see this in a semifictional context  think Tacitus The Annals of Imperial Rome Classics if youve read him  then this is great It just wasnt interesting enough to hold my attention for the 
The original version is super
all of which are described summarily When the book finally lets up on the constant military skirmishes and battles
the book has only very briefly broken free of its military confines  Three Kingdoms mainly deals with a power struggle
the outcome of which is determined mostly through military actions As far as I can tell
there is little to be found in the book that isnt related to this aforesaid power struggle and associated skirmishes and battles
so its not going to appeal to people who are looking for something profound or insightful outside of military tactics Initially
despite finding it to be lacking in more subtle forms of expression
for instance Ive grown tired of it though as military scheming and fighting is virtually all the book is about and at that
and he fell dead from his horse I usually have lots of patience for older literature I read and enjoyed War And Peace
and countless other old books
but I fear my patience has run out hereessentally its been a waste of time and money bought the whole unabridged Moss Roberts translation I kept reading it due to all the positive reviews
matched only by his creative English writing As for the original book itself
except the stories are based on a vivid part of Chinese history
its probably this story But you probably know it as Journey to the West  Its not only been released in numerous editions as a novel
and Im sure there must be a video game of it out there If youre thinking
Chinese folklore Sounds boring Think again This is a superhero story Monkey
is an immortal who has all manner of supernatural powers He can fly He can make copies of himself He can transform himselfeither disguising himself as another being or appearing as an inanimate object He has an iron truncheon that can be the size of a sewing needle or a mile long and which is indestructible Wielding said staff
the flaw is Superman Syndrome Thats what I call it when the hero is so ridiculously overpowered that even when hes fighting gods
or whole armies theres still no doubt about the outcome Of course
the Monkey does eventually meet his match in the form of the Buddha The Buddha defeats Monkey not in combat
and the trip is long and arduous Some of the challenges require brute force but in many cases they are battles of wits So while Monkey may be overpowered
he does experience personal growth over the course of the story The story is told over  chapters
which is useful given the historic and cultural nuances that may not be clear to readers It should be noted that this is unambiguously a Buddhist tale There is a bias against Taoists and other nonBuddhist religions evident throughout the story Its not just the fact that the Buddha easily defeats Monkey when no other deity or group of deities can
I guess I would recommend this book for fiction readers
particularly if you have an interest in the superhero genre or Chinese literature
This version of Journey to the West exudes a perfumed wind Waley is the greatest of translators from Chinese  While this is abridged and cannot match the magisterial but stiffer version of Anthony Yu
it is just right for an introduction to this fabulous work Many who read this will want to tackle Yu Many others would not wish it longer than it is Waley occupies a happy position at the boundary between these two groups
Wonderfully funny and sometimes poignant ancient classic novel about pilgrimage by the wild and resourceful Monkey King and the diffident Tripitaka
Monkeys nominal master Heres one of my favorite quotes from the novel They travelled on for many days and autumn had already come when late one evening Tripitaka reined in his horse and said
This is a funny book as well as quite a serious one Keeping an open mind while reading makes for a better experience  Monkey is a lot like you and me  He does the hard work to become enlightened and a standout person only to become a stronger egocentric narcissus blind to the rights and feelings of others  But he is finally chastised for his behavior and learns to be true to his word and use his powers to help others and in the process does not lose any of his essential essence that makes him who he is  It is a fine tale masterfully written and fun to read  There is a reminder here that we all have something of a Monkey Mind inside us
Its journey to the west but in a more compact read  The monk travels westward to spread buddhism but has quite a journey  The read journey to the west is too long for undergraduate students  So I can assign this to them since is only about  pages  The full length translation by the same person is  volumes and about  pages  I recommend the full length version if you are reading for your personal enrichment of reading a Chinese classic  If you just want a quick read to understand the legend better than any movie
then this is a fine abridged version of the translation I enjoy most and bought the last time I was in China  To be honest
none of the popular culture shows or childrens books I have seen here
are anywhere close to the actual book  They just borrow some of the characters and call it Monkey King  This is the real deal and
and spinoff tales Donnie Yen just did a new movie in  based on this book,and in  Journey to the West was released in theaters Thats the mark of a book with staying power  Its a fun read with twists and turns and magic and all the splendor and wonder you expect from China  years ago Think of the most sensational and unreal KungFu movie you ever saw with flying swords and beasts and rooftop fights
Monkey is an incredible tale that I read as a child and am looking forward to reading again as an adult I was so happy to see this reprint in paperback The story itself is a wonderful comedic adventure that provides insights into Taoism
hilarious There are many reviews of the story if you search the internet
is that they are all based on Chinas infamous Sun Wukongor The Monkey King The tale of the Sun Wukong is one of the four major Chinese literary classics  His chapter story
was written by Wu ChenEn  in the s  Monkeys legend is based on the true story of a wellknown monk
reality gives way to a much more entertaining and fantastic version of the story Journey to the West is a heros quest
elaborated with Monkeys supernatural powers
it was considered unfit for educated and high ranking men to read any kind of comic or popular literature  Wu was influenced in writing this tale by the superhero stories he read secretly while in school The entertaining escapades of Sun Wukong have remained popular through the ages
Monkey or the Monkey King or The Journey to the West is one of the great epic novels in Chinese culture  Set in the th century
but not written in the current form until the th century it was part of an oral tradition before that
as they journey to India to bring back sacred scrolls from Buddha  Arthur Waley has done a truly impressive job of translating
usually through magical or supernatural powers
it prevents this repetitive style from dragging on
to the basic story line
one learns much about ancient Chinese culture
the  pilgrims rather than being model characters are actually quite flawed
because it always requires a group effort to surpass each hurdle  This is a wonderful book  Translating from contemporary Chinese to English is difficult enough
Waley has done an amazing job
with some touches of philosophy and fantasy What I liked most about this book it is that it does not obey the norms or guidelines of western literature The heroes can be cowards
Mama used to read between bites at the dinner table to keep seven kids quiet and interested
and let Dad enjoy his dinner She looked for books that had a beautiful flow to the language that would attract even the baby
simple enough basic story lines that the little kids would enjoy it
subtler meanings to engage the older kids and adults This one
always learning more The other mostrepeated books were Kiplings Kim and Tolkeins The Hobbit   It is the story of the irreverent magic Monkey King who had adventures on earth
tricked a sage into teaching him the secrets of magic and immortality
and then created havoc on earth and in the beaurocracy of heaven Mama explained that the idea of beaurocracy is deeply ingrained
and that people tend to imagine their afterlife to be ideal versions of what this one might be As punishment Monkey was imprisoned for  years under the Mountain of the Five Elements
and as penance was to accompany and protect the priest Tripitaka on a journey from China to India to bring back copies of sacred scrolls
this book is very true to the original version Three reasons why I would purchase this  One of Chinas Most famous novels  Abridged Version if you are pressed with time  True to the original version
but also different cultures and different philosophies This is a very readable translation of a portion of the epic
this is probably the best version Deeper retellings are a slog to get through and unless you really want every drop
youre better off with a version youll complete
The original name of this story is Journey to the West  It is the Chinese equivalent of Grimms Fairy Tales  Like Snow White or other beloved Western fairy tales
every Chinese child knows this epic story of the Monkey King and his companions journey to the West to seek enlightenment  Along the way
fairies and other fantastic characters I had heard this story many times when I was little and I am still enchanted by the story now that I am a parent  I highly recommend this book for both parents and children  Each chapter is a complete story so its a great bedtime read
and fantastical in a way that most storiesbooks of this kind are simply not I believe it when people say this is one of the best translations out there
Have really enjoyed this version of this story  I had no problem understanding the author  although it could be I was brought up surrounded by the British accent  My only problem was that parts of it seemed fainter
and I turned up the volume it would inevitably go back to normal
For the most part I enjoyed the story There were times where parts of the story seemed to be glanced over and other less detailed parts seemed to be dragged out longer than needed Granted this is an abridged translation
so it could be something lost in translation or just missing from the abridged version
meaning and breadth of meaning and effect  to each  and through each stage of life It is originally written in  good sized books and has been translated to English as well as other languages many times  In many things translated
a poetry and social commentary and more in one This abridged version notes it tries to capture only the major and translatable stories in this absolutely magnificent piece of literature
while maintaining as literal translation of the words as possible  Great writings
are great almost in spite of dialect not just because of them  This is an example of that The selections and presentation succeeds in all regards and you are swept into the writing and can feel and be washed away in joy and thought by it  It is entirely comfortable for we US type readers  So great is what you get that it even makes me jealous of those who have the ability  to enjoy it exactly as it was written  as many have said for generations  it can be life alteringly powerful This is a very approachable read for anyone with a USanglo perspective  and as recommended to me  the best one from that point of view
the story is fun
This is a stunning translation of an inherently beautiful story of adventure and spirituality The selection of stories is careful and coherent
while the language is readable and entertaining Its amazing how Waley captured so many of the jokes and digs in here Kindle version worked fine
you should buy this as it is well written and not tedious as other versions are Aurthur Waley did an excellent job of making the story a joy to read You can even read this book to your children the same way you would read any fairy tale book to children It is nicely organized with each chapter as a separate episode or story that allows for a pause between chapters without losing the overall arc of the story It is entertaining
and has hidden gems of both wisdom and mystical teachings for those who have the eyes to see In other words
you can learn advanced spiritual alchemy from this book if you are paying attention Secret lore hidden in a fairy tale Ironicallyit also shows Buddhisms nastier side Few people know that even the Buddha himself had no problem using force to convince others of the superiority of his argument Or that there is no such thing as mercy and forgiveness in Buddhism The wheel of Karmadivine punishment is merciless and inescapable And refusing to bow down and know your proper place in the hierarchy is an unpardonable sin A great read
I can tell the translation is superb I myself have enjoyed this book in the original Chinese edition and have loved it since I first read it The Monkey is such a beloved trickster hero that everyone knows and adores in China and many countries of Asia Highly recommend this book for your whole family
even comic books This translation captures so much of the same humor and personalities of the characters that it was just as enjoyable as the Chinese version But a big downside is that its missing so many of the best adventures of the original story That means we miss out on many of the Monkeys crazier transformations
and more of the interpersonal conflicts between the main characters It was like reading part  of a trilogy I wish he had simply translated more Nevertheless
if you are new to this story
this is not to be misseda very good introduction to one of the greatest Chinese stories ever written
This is a collection of traditional tales from an early China  It was tongueincheek even then but allows a view into another culture  And in the end it is a redemptive tale in a Buddhist tradition
A fun read with fun characters
Very good fairy tale
Its a great translation that keep things moving and carries through the humor of the story  Unfortunately
the printing is low quality  Issues such as shown in the photo on many pages
Charming tale in generally
maybe the best version of it
and the Kindle edition is very readable
while pages  through  are missing My copy is the th printing of the th edition Grove Press Unless you can confirm in advance that your copy will be a corrected printing
I recommend getting the book where you can inspect it first Note Im required to give the book a star rating in order to post this warning Please discount this rating as an evaluation of the books content
An exciting adventure story fleshed out with religious philosophies and historical references Ive never read the original Chinese version so I cant compare
but this abridged translation is still a standout book
I read this book at least  times in my past It was one my ex husbands favorite books When I read the story it made me feel very happy inside He lost the book in his many moves So I purchased it as a Christmas present and he was delighted to receive it
My daughter had this book for a reading assignment during thanksgiving break and I had to get a copy for myself plus another one to share Anyone reading Monkey will identify with the main character at some point
The book gives an interesting insight into cultir differences
in places it could do with some additional editing  shonky translations and just plain errors in spelling and grammar
but the inner text is a bit faded
but still feel as though I missed out on something rich by not reading the full novel
though this is an abridged version
One of the greatest books ever written
full of side plots and weird characters
its economy was in shambles and its government paralyzed What destroyer has invaded this ancient land
its kind of interesting  But the story is so boring and predictable  Monkey always wins his battles and outwits his enemies
blah blah blah  The plot is so contrived as to be thoroughly boring  The story of the journey to the west was so famed that I was curious and purchased this
you will regret it  Only buy this book if you have to read it for class  I hear that Arthur Waleys translation is an abridged version of the Chinese original  I can only surmise that the original is  times as boring
the printing and binding of this edition is really horrible  cheap paper
very bad binding The ink of most of the pages is very light and fuzzy
the former page one has much better printing and binding and is good for gifts But this book the page one absolutely cannot be used as gifts since it looks way too cheap like those from onedollar store
and printingfond is absolutely not appropriate for young readers to protect their eyes
I received the book within a few days of placing my order The book was in great condition  Would definitely recommend if you are trying to get this book right away
There is a sort of give no x attitude in this translation and in other translations which is refreshing Like the tales tamed by Grimm and sanitized by Disney the Journey to the West has faced similar issues but in this translation wr avoid this for the most part Murder
dragons getting their heads chopped off by dreaming ministers are just a few of the topics faced in this abridged collection You can definitely see where so much of dragonball and dragonball z looted from this ancient novel a bit clearer in this translation compared to the more safe movies and tv shows made in the West or for the West Check it out It is good to know more about where so many stories and themes originates
meaningful phrasing is lost All abridgments will leave out parts that some people love or feel are indispensable That being said  The Grove Press edition of Arthur Waleys translation of has been on my bookshelf since about  It is not the same physical book The original fell apart after much rereading I have let friends borrow the book and have despaired of having it returned I have read several other translations and none of them satisfy me Friends who know
have told me that the Waley translation is the only one that retains the wit and flavor of the original I believe that The next best translation
and flavor rather than a mechanical replacement of words The criticism that I would have to agree with is simple
there isnt enough of it I know that an abridged version is the best that we could hope for and even so
better known to history as Hsuan Tang
along with a cycle of fantastic  legends that began appearing around the tenth century AD and the stage  presentations which began in the thirteenth century provided the source  material for Wu Chengens wonderful tales This is Waleys  spelling The first seven chapters are dedicated to telling Monkeys  story up until the time he became Tripitakas disciple  Monkey
mostly  through trickery has become more powerful than most of the gods and has  rebelled against them until he is finally overpowered and imprisoned in a  block of stone  He is freed in order to become the first of the three  disciples In chapters eight through twelve we are introduced to Hsuan  Tsang Tripitaka and learn about the origins of his pilgrimage to India  The balance of the one hundred chapters are dedicated to the pilgrimage  itself Early in the pilgrimage
and each has unique magical powers  Without  these powers
adventure the author ends by dedicating these  hundred chapters to the glory of Buddhas pure land We are  told that these tales are for the entertainment of children and adults  alike  While I agree that this is true of the content of the tales
it is  my opinion that reading this translation would be difficult for young  children There are translations available that are written in more child  friendly language  For any reader of mythology
but luckily Waley renders it as Tripitaka for most of the novel
which Williams cant get wrong Williams has a thick Received Pronunciation accent thats the Queens English for you nonBrits which many will find hilarious
and which some will find unbearable The story itself is quite funny in many places
and was a popular and widespread folk tale for at least  years before then
so dont expect the pacing of a st century novel Monkey masters Daoist magic and after making a name for himself on earth
to order a holy man from China to travel to India to get authentic Buddhist scriptures She picks Xuanzang of course The merciful goddess offers Monkey absolution and enlightenment if he lays aside his vile Daosit magicks
takes up the one true path of Buddhism
a quiet water spirit
but what there is of it conveys well the flavour of the tale without outstaying its welcome The plot
its little more than a succession of episodes involving bizarre monsters being defeated with elaborate magical powers There is
plenty of humour  generally farcical in nature
although occasionally quite dry  and the bickering of the main characters is frequently entertaining The bureaucratic nature of heaven
in which spirits and deities are assigned strictly hierarchical posts  with salaries  is amusing regardless of how much you know of Chinese history and society However
many of the Buddhist and Taoist elements may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the basic concepts Some of the episodes rely quite heavily on outcomes grounded in
Waleys abridged translation of the popular Chinese classic Journey to the West is an approachable version for the initiate but I strongly recommend W J F Jenners excellent full and unabridged translation
also available from Amazon Waleys abridged version concentrates mainly on the beginnings of the pilgrimage eg Monkeys origins
go on and get Jenners fuller version Monkey is Chinas version of the universal tricksterhero Jenner captures all of Wu Cheng Ens sly humour
and you cannot help but laugh out loud when you read his translation
The book itself is pretty good I dont know if the translation is accurate or not
I was expecting a mildly amusing but somewhat slowgoing novel when I picked up Monkey for my class in Chinese Literature But I could not put it down and finished the whole of it in two sittings This book is as much of  a page turner as any modern novel
using everything from cunning plot turns  to endofchapter guises And if you dont know what became of them
 you must listen to what is told in the next chapter to absolutely  hilarious anecdotes I laughed aloud at the Taoist Holy Water  episode An amazingly wellcrafted novel with a very very fluid  translation that makes it an absolute delight to read Again I could not  put this book down The fight scenes were also spectacularstill  panting
who lived between     This translation is absolute joy to read It is the story of a noble Chinese priest on a journey to find the scriptures of India for his God
A blurb from The Nation describes the book as a combination of picaresque novel
 Arabian Nights and modern political satire  But despite the seemingly esoteric description
breezy novel  The reader doesnt need to know who Lao Tzu is to laugh when he pinches Monkey and tells him Be off with you
and dont let me find you hanging round here heaven anymore  The reader doesnt need to have a few University years of Chinese fiction or philosophy under the belt before laughing at Monkey stuffing himself with the Jade Emperors peaches  Nor
Monkey still likes to crack a dragon joke before clobbering one over the head with his cudgel in a real garlicpounding blow that will finish him off for good and all Waleys translation flows lightly
fun story centered around a stoneborn ape
sacred texts and enlightenment  Strikingly similar to  Arabian Nights in both form
and content I wonder whether a knowledge of the True Scriptures would not cause some improvement in them  Do you yourself possess those scriptures asked the Bodhisattvas  Yes
and animated characters that one would forget that there are many layers to this book It is a fairytale as well as a satire and a historical fiction based on the true events of Tan San Zang Tripitaka in the book With the outline of Tan San Zangs pilgrimage to India to fetch Buddhist scriptures during the arts and cultural Bronze Age of China
Journey to the West expands his perilous journey over the Gobi desert
Monkey unleashes the imagination against the cultural backdrop of China It plays on the three major religions and ways of thinking of Buddhism
one who pokes fun at oneself it is not hard to see why Monkey has become a favorite Chinese classic touching every mind
Journey to the West has imbedded moral values that can be found The characters are fictionalized
yet he is portrayed as a feeble monk who often cries like a woman but his tenderness can move his disciples Monkey or Sun Wu Kong is witty and the most powerful of Tripitakas disciples
another disciple is slow but he is nonetheless loyal and brave Sandy
also one of the three disciples is mostly along for the ride but he represents sincerity Even though a big part of their journey is out of this world
their lively characters embodying their flaws and assets can be related to by anyone who tried to get along with another person Lastly
the translation of the book by the famous Arthur Waley preserves the comical essence of the book Furthermore
the most important sequences of Journey to the West can be found and enjoyed in his translation of Monkey
in allegorical form
his translations of which were a key to the growth of Buddhism in China  His reallife travelogue is itself considered to be a great work of literature
who represents rebelliousness against both heavenly and earthly order  Pigsy
but even in this abridged version is way too long  Characters motivations and the meanings of most of the action are awfully obscure  And like any picaresque
without the various episodes necessarily adding up to a coherent and sustained story  The book is interesting as a cultural relic
you wouldnt imagine it to be such an influential text GRADE  C
most of what is removed is not as interesting The best part  about Arthur Waleys translation of Journey to the West he  renamed it Monkey is that he is one of the first to play up  the very hilarious humor in the book
though there is of course a quite  serious religious undertone to the whole thing This is an amazingly funny  story from the Ming Dynasty
 peculiar humor or spiritual quests A true classic of Asian literature
published  warns that the Waley translation includes only thirty out of the one hundred chapters of the original text
and many of the most significant episodes have been omitted A glance through these reviews and I dont see that anyone has caught the fact that this translation contains barely  of the original Chinese book Admittedly its the only game in town
but this is still significant information
and upon reading its first  chapters the book quickly became my favourite fairy tale Monkeys absurd arrogance is funny
his optimism and selfassurance is infectious He thinks nothing of travelling from heaven to hell and all points in between Solving problems along the way by banging a few heads together or of achieving immortality by stealing peaches The story of how he got his great weapon A staff used to hammer the Milky Way flat by essentially being the worst guest in history to a much putupon sea dragon
suprisingly for one written  years ago in a distant land
its so funny The pace kept up brilliantly the final scene of the books first act
until he is imprisoned beneath a vast mountain and begins the long road to his redemption and eventual enlightement I havent even talked about the main plot of this wonderful story
What a wonderful translation of this classic text Fans of Chineses mythology and the classic Japanese cult TV show will be enthralled by this text The book appeals to all ages and mental capacities much like an episode of the Simpsons also does There are many moral messages portrayed and lots of classically funny moments Read with intense focus of the adventures of the holy fool Tripitaka
the glutful Pigsy and the philosophical Sandy as they travel to India for the scriptures to save mankind Enjoy
Translation is a bit old and silly but it has its charms Worth a read to see if you want to invest in the much longer version
Dantes Divine comedy ranked highest on my list  My interest in the anime and manga story Dragonball and subsequently
moreso than Dantes work  The central characters rise to glory is so colorful and intricate
one cannot help but laugh  The introduction of KwanYin brings a serious aspect to the tale and a more admirable goal
but the focus on Monkey keeps the nature of the journey in check  Despite the absurdity of the characters Monkey and Pigsy in particular though not them alone
the story maintains a very epic feel This version up until KwanYins introduction deals very little with all the Buddhist dogma that permeates the story  Even afterward
Monkeys mission is at the forefront  The author has done a fine job making the tale accessible to everyone being a white
Monkeys audiobook audio is hard to listen to The transition to digital did not work Kenneth Williams does a great job narrating
but but the audio quality makes it very hard to listen to on modern devices
One of the best books Ive read in all my life The characters have been  borrowed and turned into many different characters in film and animation
Mr Waley has achieved the unthinkable the best western  translation of one of Chinas best kept secrets A stone monkey
This inspired me to go out and apply for college and start my own journey The part i found to be the most engaging is the story of sun wukong aka the monkey king
i enjoyed how hard he tried to become equal to the gods and eventually he does For being such an old tale it still holds up in modern times
yeeess And that Holy fool Tripitaka I am disrespectful to demons
one of the great classics of Chinese literature Make sure and choose a version that is right for you The stories are neat but a little repetative I would definately recommend an abridged version Still
the adventures are interesting and give an insight into Chinese culture and mythology
Monkey is the most deliteful journey to enlightenment  I am its biggest fan  I highly encourage anyone and everyone to read it regardless of age or education  It will teach you most everything you will ever need to know
a fine translation with surprisingly few footnotes
but the sheer length and readability make it worth the while
simple style Maybe someday I can get over the energy barrier and give it another try But if youre a Judge Dee fan
dont be sure you can get yourself into this story
Wow As a massive fan of the original Monkey TV show which aired in England in the s
I had always been interested in reading the even more original book by Wu Chen En This is an excellent level book which youd never guess is as old as around  years Beautifully translated into English
but a level of English that is easily accessible to just about anyone Its a beautiful read and very inspiring if you are travelling somewhere but also inspiring even if youre not Sometimes the chapters are short and sometimes theyre long but either way they are never boring Its carefully written and beautifully thought out and I would recommend it to anyone seeking an inspiring read Its also not too hard to get through Took me about  days to finish it and I loved every moment
This is an enjoyable story
but so many things seem overviewed in this abridged translation that it leaves me wishing to read the full translated version which I know is available
the Chinese translation in to English seems wrong in some parts  either by phonetical spelling oddities
not bad Id say this is a good general overview of a story
it would be better to seek a full translation  which I plan to do
Arthur Waleys translation of Wu Chengens Monkey is lively
humorous and captures wonderfully vibrant characterisations of a myriad host of characters
the influences of this tale on Masashi Kishimotos manga Naruto are evident I am now curious to read more of Arthur Waleys translations
and could have been cut Overall though if you have an interest in Asian fiction and light hearted romps through distant kingdoms this is for you
A must read for anyone interested in reading Chinese classics I can see this book being made into a movie one day if it hasnt already What an intelligent man for the th century Long live his brilliant read I hope more people discover this hidden gem I dont want to say more than that it is very easy to read and at times you feel that youre in Monkeys life
it is difficult to appreciate why the author chose to call it Monkey While the character of Monkey does occupy much of the first part of the book and remains the strongest and
most peoples favourite character throughout
both obvious and subtle It would help if you had a certain understanding of Chinese History and culture in your reading of this book to understand the many references contained within However
and are then thrown into a seemingly completely unrelated topic But the way Wu ChengAn has worked all these plots into a coherent story is truly brilliant Instead of finding it disjointed
I found the the jumps kept the book very exciting While there are certain parts of the plot which I assume are composed according to the epic style of the time for example
these dont detract anything from the novel to one who is used to epic literature for example
both loveable and naughty with fabulous powers Sandy doesnt really do much Tripitaka is hilarious simply because he is portrayed as the hero of this book but spends most of his time being rescued by his disciples It truly is riotous Thus
The basic premise of this novel
sees a group of four set out on an epic journey to recover the Buddhist sutras from India and bring them to China On the way they encounter various monsters
ghosts and demons trying to stop them The four represent different sides of human nature
their journey to the West actually India mirrors the human journey of life and whilst Heaven is awash with bureaucracy
the Earth is littered with challenges and obstacles The Monkey King is perhaps the most famous character of all
the ability to transform himself into over  different shapes and a whole host of magical powers Tripitaka is the monk
but not averse to reciting a curse that can keep Monkey under control Pigsy is the third main character
but pretty nondescript member of the group The story is humorous and satirical It contains a lot of references to Chinese history and elements of Buddhism and Taoism Daoism which can be a bit confusing if you have no previous knowledge Arthur Waleys translation is only a fraction of the original tome however
and those looking for a genuine translation of equal depth to the original should look elsewhere Think of this as a distillation of some of the best bits Perhaps you need to live in China to realise just how important this novel is
but also in the Chinese contemporary imagination If youre interested in China and Chinese cultural mythology
how did he get to possess the staff Why does he wear a head band that hurts his head Did they get the Buddhist scriptures from India Who was Pigsy and Sandy It actually goes hand in hand with the old TV show really well funnily but is so beautifully translated I adore this book and take a copy everywhere I go
Good quality binding and cover This story is vastly underrated Monkey is a mix of adventure and morality that blends together in an early quest tale that is unlike those found in the West Although I knew the ending and characters beforehand
I had no idea of the variety of adventures they undertake Well worth a read
Those of a certain age in the UK will remember the Japanese TV series of a Chinese folk tale
well this is the book where it all began This is the story of a Monk tasked to collect holy scriptures from the India and bring them back to China On his travels is his accompanied by Monkey
but still manages to tell a good story However I would recommend buying the physical book The Kindle copy contains a number of OCR errors
where the publisher has attempted to convert the physical book to an ebook Even with the latest updated version you will see the odd  or  in place of z
A charming story to read Monkey is a very likeable and witty character and this text is easy to read in modern English
Bought this because I am a fan of the old TV series Was pleasantly surprised to find that the humour and silliness were not fabricated by TV producers
but actually exist in the original text As a translation of a sixteenth century text
but I now see how it fit so neatly into a TV format Ive read this to my son as a bedtime story
and he loved it Its a real magical story that does not age Love it
I decided to buy this and was pleasantly surprised to find the book so much better still Arthur Waleys translation renders it exceedingly accessible to a worldwide audience A timeless classic
I bought this as it is what the TV series Monkey was based on It was brilliant from start to finish as the TV show practically copied this ancient story word for word Crucial reading for any Monkey fans
Highly recommend if interested in oriental literature Simple and easy to read
very enjoyable Amusing characters and plots will keep you hooked
is as iconic to many British schoolchildren thanks to the dubbed TV version as the original text is to the Chinese Whats interesting is how closely the TV stuck to the book One of the great reads A joy
 stars great page turner Each adventure gets better each time Monkey is my favorite character who just keeps evolving
I bought this book after running a web search for the TV programme Monkey and thus discovering that the series was based on an ancient Chinese story This abridged telling of the story is obviously well  translated  the English is very rich and  where some differences in  language could not be literally resolved like when Chinese wordplay were  rendered irrelevant there were useful footnotes  Waley has gone against  the convention for previous translations of the Monkey story he has  rendered a small section of the saga in its entirety rather than covering  the entire story in a much abridged form I found the story fairly dense
 it is very stylised and so fans of Chinese history and culture will love  it  I was surprised by how malevolent the Monkey character was and by how  antagonistic the relationships between him and the other main characters  were For those fellow fans of the TV programme
roughly half of the book  comprises the story of Monkey before the TV show  ie the story of how he  rose from a simple monkey to become an Immortal and a Monkey King  The  rest of the book describes the quest of Monkey
Pigsy and Tripitaka  to retrieve scripture scrolls from the Buddhas of India  This part of the  book was most like the TV show  a series of subquests or episodes with  the team of characters resolving subplots like ridding a village of some  evil ogres who plague and bully them but I found they became slightly  repetitive and hard to follow due to the plethora of DragonKings
and the inconsistent wielding of  magical powers which made me think
well if you have THAT magic  power
why didnt you employ it in the last chapter when it could have  easily got you out of that tight squeeze The story is full of  allegory and subtle humour and satire  but I suspect it was slightly too  highbrow and subtle and buried in the Chinese imagery and language for me  to appreciate fully  If you liked the TV series then the familiar names  have some nostalgia value but the book is slightly hard work  and the team  of characters not the jovial tightknit bunch I remember indeed there  exists between the main characters throughout the book a sense of mutual  dislike which gave the book
Great product loved it
And excellent translation of this classic
A decent presentation of the tales of Monkey and his friends Great read
Excellent quality dispatched instantly a wonderful book
humour and a great taste of Chinese culture
great beginning but it gets boring as the monk turns out to be such a crying baby
understanding and appreciation for this novel
A must read for anyone wanting to get a better grip and insights on the ChineseJapanese culture This story has been a source of inspiration to many different other books
the story loses a little interest after Monkey is imprisoned and becomes a disciple It becomes slow and feels like there wont be anything new happening
the humor and the intent of the chapters arent lost A great read for inquisitive spiritual readers
seems like an older edition Papers all old
New book Paperback In a good condition as expected A cheaper and better bargain than some other hardcover options
very good translation
this classic novel is in my to read list for quite some time and I have high expectations for it
i started to read this book as it was my book club choice  gave up half way through  but loved the last line of each chapter
These stories were well written and provide an insight into a religion unknown to many  There were adventures and trials
Awesome story An irrepressible monkey character
Absolutely brand new condition I am very happy with this purchase
For those who enjoy mythology and fantastic tales this book is for you Plenty of fights and battles between supernatural warriors However the story revolves around the Monkeys personal journey
first to gain the knowledge to become powerful and inmortal
earth and hell and finally to redeem himself by helping Monk Xuanzang from China get the Buddhist sacred scriptures from the remote West India  This book is like a Kung Fu flick from the Tang dinasty and its a delightful first step to study the chinese literary tradition
the priest traveling to the West to secure authentic Buddhist scriptures from India to carry back to China
who helped him and guarded him throughout his arduous journey Read and enjoy this enchanting and celebrated folk tale from China
splendid insight into the stories that form part of the Asian character today
and this was recommended to me by a Chinese student who told me that most Chinese students have read this book
The book is a nice summary of the rise and fall of the monkey king IT is great for all those
this version is very good I enjoyed the funny side of Wukong very much
the terribleness of the Pig  and the seriousness of the Master Something that was really great was to read about their loyalty to each other The translations were really great
to see how each quest ended I can truly recommend this book to anyone who is somewhat interested in the story of the Xuanzangs journey to the west It has everything a good book needs
Very good book but the first three hundred pages are very boring but when they meet wan sang it gets like better and also it keeps on repeating the same plot and monkey kills the demons like
Wonderful book and subject matter but I prefer the penguin classic translation
go for this one The full version is almost  pages bigger Read both
Wu Chengens sixteenthcentury novel Journey to the West tells the story of the pilgrimage of Buddhist monk Xuanzang to the Western Regions of Central Asia and India in order to obtain Buddhist stras and return them to China between  and  CE Xuanzang wrote his own account in 
which formed the outline of Wus novel The novel is a humorous adventure that satires Chinese bureaucracy while also telling an allegory of enlightenment Many in the EuroAmerican world know elements of the story from Arthur Waleys  abridged translation
this novel is one of the Four Classic Novels of Chinese literature This edition presents the complete novel in four volumes
there was a particular choice made in translation that I found immensely irritating  US Standard units were used
and it was disappointing to see here There were also some odd translations within the descriptions
An excellent translation
its an ancient Daoist Chinese tale with absolutely no quarter given to modern western minds However
it is definitely worth the effort This is not considered a classic for nothing For those not familiar with the story
it is a mythological recounting of the adventures of an actual Chinese monk who travelled to India through countless perils Probably the closest in AngloSaxon tradition is Beowulf
which recounts Scandanavian history in the same way Journey to the West isnt simply high adventure
though Each of the adventures explores specific issues and the Chinese Daoist interpretation It is thus intended as educational As a guide to thoughts strange and alien to western minds
My daughter was thrilled with book collection and has been avidly reading it since we got it for her at the start of the summer break I havent read it myself
but I will relate that it speaks to her year old sensibilities and she has been enjoying them Perhaps at some point I will have the time to read the set and see what the fuss is about  Kort
This is a four volume translation of the great Chinese epic It is published by the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing I suspect this a government organization I do not read Chinese
so I cannot say anything about the translation But I like this version It is poetic and appears to be completeit is over  pages long This is a pure translation
each of the four volumes has about three notes at the end There are other translations that explain everything Those explanations are not essential to enjoying the story I recommend this version if you just want to read a great story
which already merits your attention To be more specific  this is an epic full of the most diverse adventures
in the style of the glorious AncientGreek  Iliad
till the happy end The heroes also carry all kinds of special weapons and possess supernatural powers  belonging to a culture that has probably inspired also those very computer games These heroes purpose is double  fighting against evil creatures
and refining their own selves in order to reach heavenly immortality They are three
symbolizing the three parts of each body The witty Monkey represents the intelligent resourceful brain The pious monk Sanzang is the compassionate heart
by the great Buddha himself His only way to release himself from his eternal imprisonment is  to help the pious monk Sanzang
make the ,milesjourney to the west to fetch the scriptures for the impious easterners On the way theyre surprised by seemingly impossible tasks
which they must fight according to the different circumstances Each battle is described in a short free poem
and so each victory is ours too Since the book concentrates mostly on the versatile everlasting fight between Good and Evil
even  years old
whoever is willing to enjoy a long journey from China to India
different habits of many countries  at least twelve are mentioned  and also visit many levels of heaven and even the underworld on the way  and get out of it intact  all this without leaving the comfortable home and even bed  especially during long cold nights  just step out and invest in buying this book  its simply indispensable  A personal confession  I happened to be born in the Year of the Monkey according to the Chinese astrology
just for having such a representative in one of the most fascinating specimens of the world literature  the most charming Monkey youll ever meet 
I am so happy I bought this edition of the series It arrived on time in great condition I have been wanting to read this book and am very happy with this particular translation It is written is a poetic yet easily understandable way The  books are bound in a nice cover A couple previous customers commented about the thinness of the paper For me this was a good thing I was concerned that  page books were not going to fit on the shelf
but due to how thin the books are made I do not have this problem This is a delightful read and a great edition Highly recommended
I bought this some time ago and finally got around to reading it  The language is great if flowery
but part way through I discovered several blank pages  The one sent to me is the th printing of   I bought it over a year ago so dont think theres any return policy  If anyone buys this
check it upon receipt for blank pages  Mine start at page  of volume one  I can follow the story across the blank pages
 stars for the translation   stars for the physical book quality Since other people have expounded on the plot
here is a review based on the physical book The actual paperback novels are approximately  x 
so easy to hold in your hand and tuck into a briefcase  The pages are a bit thin
but they are a bit thinner than most paperback books  One of my volumes didnt hold up well to sitting in a steamfilled bathroom There are occasional pictures and sparse endnotes
but they do not detract from the story at all  The pictures were drawn during the Qing Dynasty  and are done in the old chinese style
not some newfangled doodles Some of the translation is a bit iffy
and sentences do not necessarily always make sense
but it just adds to the goofy charm of this book  Dont bother wringing your hands over the neverending list of characters  Skim over them and read on  After all
there are an awful lot of demons and gods to meet on the journey
making their characters irrelevant in the longrun  One thing I noticed is that there is an awful lot of scatological farce for a book written in the Ming dynasty dont worry
this is the one I anticipate picking up again and again  I loved this book as a child and ten years later
I still do  A mustread for fans of mythology or Chinese literature in general
This is an excellent translation of the entire JTTW  Sure
the paper is paperthin and cheap
saving time  Stop whining for short money you are getting almost  pages of the finest mythology
and monkey buttkicking awesomeness  My favorite book in the world
its a fun novel for  year old novel  Also keep in mind that this are  books
but definitely not prime material  I would recommend get this if you wanna read the novel and thats it  if you want a book you can keep and collect 
Its a great collection to have whether youre familiar with the story or not  However
the written style is a little hard to read and the translation of names is a bit too literal that its almost comical and confusing  Nonetheless
This is the most complete and faithful translation of Journey to the West I have yet found It is the third version of the story Ive read
preserving very faitflly both the style and content of the original story This extreme faithfulness is both a strength and a weakness Its a strength in that you get a real feeling for the scope of the original work
and may be quite confusing to someone who is not familiar with Chinese culture and religion For example
and though the translations are good
translated poetry can never equal the original In one sequence
frequently singing songs set to tunes few nonChinese would recognize by name These characters are important only in that the end of their conversation sets up a conflict
so the only purpose of the sequence is to provide a chance to read the poetry Its good poetry
but it really can drag a bit You cant just automatically skip over all the poems
either Elements of the story are often told in verse You can usually skim if youre not interested in a particular bit of verse
especially given its age It will at times veer far from the main thrust of the story to recount the entire life history of a character
and has many side stories that somehow tie back into the main plot several chapters later You may at times find yourself wondering just why the author chose to include a particular bit of story
but theres almost always a payoff waiting somewhere down the line Another problem is that the style of the storytelling is not very concise If someone in the story needs to recount what has happened to them
fortunately much abridged version of an earlier portion of the story
this time You could make similar sorts of complaints about many of the early great works of English fiction
so this is not really a strong criticism given the works great age
he told them what had happened and left it at that There were also many quirks of the translation that bothered me The word memorial was used throughout instead of memorandum It took me quite a while to figure out that was what was going on I read all of the abridged translation that also made the same mistake throughout
Journey to the West is still one of the greatest works of fiction ever written The Monkey King is without a doubt my favorite character in any work I have ever read or watched The story of his journey is a brilliant parable on the jouney to enlightenment
while at the same time a story of great humor and exciting action It also provides fascinating insight into the history and traditional culture of China If you want to get the whole story and cant read Chinese
this edition is your absolute best bet Indeed
its pretty much your only bet Some of the other translations may be a faster read
called The Monkey King  Here was the story I had been searching to find in this movie named and that is when I began to look for this book True this book has pages that are so thin that they are like tissue
but they have beautiful illustrations and in these illustrations are the characters of Alakazam
and Celtic so this was a journey that had new meaning for me  And like the characters of this journey
it is a journey into a new and as yet source of spirituality that has much influence in the world
Ive been a long time reading this page classic Chinese novel  The quotes are there because
youll grow tired of the repetitive elements in the large body of the story  Think of it more as a comprehensive compendium of folklore tales centering around the central character
Monkey  The seed of the story was the actual journey of a Tang dynasty Buddhist priest from China to India and back  This journey caught the Chinese imagination and somehow became embellished with the mythical Monkey
who ultimately became much more interesting than the priest himself  Many stories grew around a formula of Monkey protecting the priest from monsters along the journey  The author
so do not expect it to meet American standards of proofreading If you are chiefly interested in enjoying the story itself
read Arthur Waleys abridged translation
Monkey  He keeps all the essential elements so that you learn the plot and get to know the characters
so it is paced more like a modern novel
I bought the paperback edition several years ago I loved the myths and read the material several times Unfortunately
 pictures are on single pages with the facing pages blank
this looks like a quality edition The hardback is printed in  volumes while the paperback English only is done in  I assume that the translation in the hardback is the same as in the paperback version That was done very well and Im looking froward to rereading the adventure with quality paper in my hands thats one of the real luxuries in life I have
I will update this review and my rating This is in addition to my original review I am now reading Volume  of  There is a horrible error in that volume There are many missing pages from Volume  in their place are many pages from Volume  I am knocking two stars off the rating because of this The vendor said he will send me a proper Volume  in October when his stock is replenished I
too many oneletter substitutions etc I am of the opinion that the final edit of a translation should always be made by a native speaker of the to language Im guessing that this opinion was not respected here The errors in the paperback version
I assume that good copies of this book set are available I would caution you to check with your seller of choice that the hard copy set you order is one that does not contain the mistakes that were in my original order At this point Im changing my product rating back to  stars
This set exceeded my expectations The text is clear and easy to read
the bindings are strong and the four books fit in their sleeve comfortably
If you want to test the waters before jumping into the deep end
it is a very good introduction to the main characters and overall conceptthe character of Sanzang aka Tripitaka being replaced by an American scholar of Chinese literature This is an incredibly lengthy story for anyone not prepared for what is inside The basis for one of Asias most beloved childrens characters Monkey
the tale is written as a series of short stories seemingly crafted with children as the target audience Fashioned similar to western childrens adventures  Arabian Nights comes to mind
each snippet of the journey comes with lots of action and shallow motivation  often falling to greed
revenge or a simple thirst for adventure I feel certain that these stories were kept easily accessible by many parents through the years as a means of entertaining their children While the characters are far from anyones idea of the heroic stereotype
only that this may not be the right choice for your first foray into Chinese literature Many adults in Asia will unashamedly admit to having read the full volumes I once spent a couple of hours discussing favorite stories and swapping character impersonations with the CEO of a large company in China during a business dinner but western readers will likely find it disjointed and often hard to follow Though rarely pivotal to the story and generally addressed in the generous notes
the author has a great propensity for injecting phrases and concepts that the casual reader will simply not be familiar with I often found myself running to Google in the middle of a paragraph There is also the tendency for characters to be referred to by multiple names or titles Monkey has more than seven with no easy way to keep them straight All things considered
wrapped a lot and some books damaged while shipped but got them on sale so no compliants going to give it  for it was just about what i thought would come out of a book on sale
on a side note no pages damaged not a worry of mine but something worth being added to the review
I am enjoying the story  And I hate to put it down when life calls me to duty  I already know I am going to hate it when I come to the last sentence of the last volume in this set  Perhaps fate will spare me and I will die before I reach the last sentence of the last volume at least
it may be true that other translations of this story are better
willl not tell you this particular translation is bad no
and the prose is actually quite good Its concise and easy to follow Im not sure about how accurate the translation is I cant read Mandarin However
is the numerous silly spelling errors throughout the book Its as if no one bothered to edit it there are one or two errors per chapter There is even a spelling error in the summary at the back of the book they used isa instead of is a The paper and print quality is below average The book is damaged and creased easily Although the story is great and the translation is good
Our family wants to learn about Chinese legends Great books
wonderful  volumes of the JourneyThe softbacks were overly tightened in being bound so that it is difficult to read the last word or twobut  its part of the journey so enjoy
but I thoughly enjoyed this series Knowing something of the Monkey King the mind and a bit of background about this book helped me to enjoy even more when I was taken on an adventure ride I will not soon forget This has got to be the longest comic book ever written  it is that entertaining Do not buy the abridged versions of the Monkey King as you will not get the full effect of what I beleive was intended
Exactly what I wanted Box set in amazing package and great price Perfect gift
I was extremely satisfied All of the books are in like new condition and have not been used any if at all stars
very good condition
nice experience
Now you can read it in English translation  This is a classic novel and one of the five best written novels
I have read the series at least three times  Very fun  Very addictive series  This series gives you a very fun look into ancient Chinese culture and mindset
The novel is obviously great But this exact translation is a little outdated You would have a much better read with the newer Alex Yu translations Also you lose a few stars for labeling this product as a novel in  volumes and not volume  of  Nowhere on the order page did it make it clear and obvious I was buying jut the th volume I really thought I had god a great deal on the complete texts
the major takeaway I had from this book was how LONG and BORING the adventure was Once the main characters are established
they have encounter after encounter with trouble which inevitably goes as follows  Monster sees Tang priest  Monster kidnaps Tang priest  Monkey saves the day It is in fact so formulaic that after having finished just the first out of four book
there is nothing truly surprising anymore I get that the whole journey is supposed to be epic and that the true length of their adventure must be shown
but just because the Priest and his disciples are tired from the journey doesnt mean we have to be Yes there is character development and exciting battles along the way
but do you need  pages for it Absolutely Not For all those looking to get into the story I strongly suggest a more condensed version
ready to fight on his own or call in favors to get the job done
Editorial Note I realize it sounds incredibly pretentious to speak on the translation
let me say that the most important aspects of translation for me are interest and readability I couldnt care less about the accuracy
etc Perhaps I want something different from a translation than most While many scholars want the reader to see the flavor of the Chinese original
some of the works of ancient Chinese literature have truly moved me I have read Three Kingdoms four times
and have perused it uncountably often I challenge any reader to find a better adventure tale than Shapiros retelling of Outlaws of the Marsh
I often lose focus sifting through the religious imagery and boring poetry yes
every poetic retelling of a battle or a landscape might as well be the first I think that the elements of a TREMENDOUS story are present indeed
but few children or adults can suffer through the tedium of passages such as Most benevelont and merciful Boddhisattva or Enlightened Teacher of the Way and Most Compassionate Buddha over and over Call me sacreligious
where poetry is often translated as prose or deleted altogether
one to the translation for an average of three altogether
I have yet to actually sit down and read these books but I wanted to review the quality of the item The box tore easily
The pages are super thin to point you can see through them
there was glue on the binding and covers of all  books that was easily scratched off with my nail
and the pages of one book were cut wrong a section was too short and the top of them were connected and had to be torn apart Not worth the money from quality alone Reading some other reviews I learned the translation is in accurate or sloppy
This item I purchased for my oldest son I taught him to like books so whenever possible I get him books  This is the type of book he is in to these days  Gathering knowledge in the way of reading books these days is such a joy that I strongly suggest this item to anyone that loves books as much as my son and I do
This rating has strictly to do with the thin paper used to create the book and not the actual content of the book  I had issues with the very thin paper the book was printed on  So thin that the opposite side of the page bled through to the page I was reading and made it appear blurry
why hasnt the Tang priest trust Monkey Kings judgement on knowing when they meet spirits and demons  They have been traveling together for like ten years or so I had to skip a lot because got tired of reading the same type of monsters capturing them and what Monkey King has to go thru to save them
the first being Yus  Jenners version makes compelling reading and I found it very difficult to put the book down  The translation is sprightly and idiomatic and the extensive passages in verse are attractively rendered The only demerits are the lack of footnotes to explain some of the references to individuals and doctrines for which one needs Yus version and the relatively poor standard of printing and typography better proofreading would have helped  However
I cannot say that these shortcomings impaired my enjoyment of these volumes and I would strongly recommend them to anyone in search of a readable version of this engrossing epic
the story is great but poor choice of wording make it difficult to read
two complete versions of the long Chinese comic novel Journey to the West  One of them
an older version made by W J F Brenner for the Foreign Language Press
though not a native English speaker
and an ethnic Chinese  Brenner is a longtime Sino translator who has rendered his fair share of Chinese classics into English  So how did these two translations fare compared with each other Brenner is a nononsensical and very sensible translator of the Wu Chengens book  While he doesnt take great liberties with the text
a difficult passage which involves understanding of Chinese arithmetics and metaphysics  Here is Brenners version In the arithmetic of the universe
the positive begins at the time I at II the cock crows at III it is not quite light at IV the sun rises V is after breakfast and at VI one does business VII is when the sun reaches noon at VIII it is slipping towards the west IX is late afternoon the sun sets at X XI is dusk and at XII people settle down for the night This is elegant as is readable and comprehensible to an English audience  Although Brenner forgoes the nittygritties of exact transliteration
and got the gist of the passage right  One could imagine this is how the author would have composed in English Brenners translation is consistently fine and accurate  His language is on the whole simple and easily understood as long you have a high school degree  Where Brenner is more limited
highspirited adventure story Brenner is idiomatic and readable
is a highly commendable piece of work  The first thing one notices about it is its extreme faithfulness to the text  even more so than Brenners  At times
it even strikes one as being slavish  One must praise his version for being so strictly straightforward
though at times this literalmindedness makes some word choices incomprehensible to English readers  Take his constant rendition of Wood Mother for instance
a term which has no meaning whatsoever in English
or eating rice for taking a meal  This is a version especially good if you know your Chinese and would like a crib to read the original with  While maybe not as idiomatic as Brenner
Yu is even more academic and scholarly in that he attempts to translate every character of the language  Faithfulness to the letter of the text takes foremost priority
but the translation is on the whole an admirable one Comparing the two
both Yu and Brenner can be recommended  Yu would be first choice if fidelity to the text is your priority  If you prefer your English to be more idiomatic and the story to flow better
Nice story Very entertaining Full of important allegory For example
and the horse where you found them You can see that it gets really interesting We all go through life with this barnyard coterie of associates
characters and polish before assigning a grade  This is a review of the novel as a whole I might do something more specific at a later date  PLOT  The novel itself is basically two stories First is the Rise and Fall of the Monkey King and the second is Xuanzangs journey to fetch scriptures from Thunder Monastery  The Rise and Fall of Monkey is like a Protagonists Journey to Villain It starts off with Stone Monkey becoming the Handsome Monkey King and going on adventures to protect his kingdom from threats
up to and including deathbyoldage Then he gets so full of himself he attacks gods and rebels against heaven In the end this villain is defeated  The plot is quick
fast paced and constantly escalates The method by which Monkey becomes so powerful makes sense The series of events that lead to him trapped under Five Elements Mountain is driven by character decisions It can stand alone as a complete story Naturally
Monkey fans want to see him get out from under that rock but it can stand alone  The rest of the novel is Xuanzangs journey to fetch scriptures It has an interesting start Theres this Dantes Inferno thing as part of the set up and theres also how Xuanzang gets involved in the quest and then how he recruits his three disciples Then its basically filler until they reach Thunder Monastery  The Pilgrims encounter demons that want to eatseduce Xuanzang and Monkey has to rescue him Usually
the only developed main characters here are the pilgrims themselves  Xuanzang is basically a walking plot device because he takes no action other than starting the journey and placing the headband on Monkeys head Monkey could jump back and forth between Thunder Monastery and Tang capital twenty times with ease but Xuanzang is mortal and cannot ride on clouds so he has to go the long and hard way He gets captured to involve the Pilgrims in the affairs of demons along the way and insists on helping everyone even if theyre a demon in disguise
thus providing the excuse to delay the Journey  If the other three characters in your cast are criminal demons
he is an old and cunning trickster Many of his victories rely on sneaking around gathering Intel and then devising a strategy to overcome his opponents advantages He also knows more about Buddhist teachings than his own master
who was raised a Buddhist monk  Pig is basically a sidekick type character He makes wisecracks
helps the hero in small ways
which is admirable on the part of the translator  Trickster Eric Novels gives Journey to the West a B
reader should own  for parallel reading
and this one is a direct translation The author uses splitcharacter method to create  main characters Master
Pig and Sandy that actually one person that holds all these character on a struggling road for good Master fears
demons and monsters are actually closely related to many gods
he is great San Zang wants to get all wisdom scroll for his nation people
then he may obtain the experience and nature of the  main characters
its better than Disney world
coz this mythical world is  real 
Journey to the West is probably the most wellknown tale amongst Chinese folk the world over  It is a story that has been adapted in the form of operas
cartoons and movies many times over  To be able to read a complete and unabridged version of this epic is a joy indeed  My only regret is that as a Westerneducated Chinese
I am not able to read this masterpiece in its original language  Although the translator does a very good job at translating the book
I am sure many nuances and subtleties of the Chinese language have been lost in the translation The story is a simple one  Set during the early Tang dynasty the peak of Chinese civilisation
a holy Buddhist monk has to travel from China to India to collect the true Mahayana Buddhist scriptures from the Lord Buddha himself
in order to bring enlightenment to his fellow country men  The journey is a long and ardous one
not least because numerous demons lie waiting in ambush for a chance to capture and eat the monk
the Goddess of Compassion assembles a strange group of bodyguards for the monk the proud and mischievous Monkey
and a Dragon Prince transformed into a horse  Their various adventures are so full of humor and wacky hijinks that I cannot help myself from laughing out from time to time  Monkey is the ultimate Chinese version of the universal tricksterhero  Do yourself a favor and pick up this book  You will not regret it for a moment
I should point out that I am just a product of the American public education system who only knows english I read this in my free time and knew little to to nothing of Chinese history Somethings
are definately lost in translation here I understand that much of the Poetry is layed out in beautiful rhymes and even set to music in Mandarin or whatever dialect came first but to read these parts translated quite so literaly into english is as painful as it is reduntant I tried to skip some of it but once in a while
there is one tiny detail that you have to catch in the poetry explanations that are integral to the overal story of a given chapter In that respect
no matter how skillfully this book was translated The origion chapters for the main characters where a thrill ride and every bit worth the cost of the book After you have established the characters and their origion stories and they set off on their
some of the monster stories start to follow simular patterns The middle to end parts of this book may have made for an entertaining tv series Every chapter there was always some kind of monster trying to eat the Tang Priest guy that Monkey and company where escourting If it wasnt scary monster animaldemon spirits trying to eat the Monk to gain immortality
it was some female monsteranimaldemon spirit trying to have sex with the Tang priest to gain immortality because he was an th generation reincarnated virgin saint or something These stories are intermitten with other chapters that had to do with them taking a detour or having to deal with someone from Monkeys past or some monsters trying to mess with our heros for whatever reason There are alot of crossover cameos from other numerous Chinese and Indian storys and mythologies To that end
there you go If you dont mind skimming through a dab of gibberish here or there to get to a great story
This is a great Chinese classic  I think that the translation is not too bad given its history
and the illustrations from the Qing dynasty are also fascinating  As for the content
I think it is probably widely known among people who study Chinese culture  The most lovable character is obviously Monkey
who will stop at nothing to protect his feeble Buddhist master the Tang priest Sanzang  Zhu the pig is also interesting as an incessantly loathsome character who specializes in overeating and overindulging in just about everything  The only character I think could have been more developed was Friar Sand   The most predictable one was Quan Yin who always ends up saving Monkey for the first two books  Some great moments were the manfruit
and of course Monkeys bad behavior in the first  chapters of the book  Its a great read for any age
Ive always loved books
particularly the kind that create a new and different world and draw you into it It seems I was pretty serious about my fantasy reading
plus all the L Frank Baum Oz books plus the Arabian Nights
they drink it like mothers milk from they day they are born  kind of like Big Bird or Elmo in the west But thats not at all a fair comparison Big Bird and Elmo fall in the category of pop culture This same category is fair game for any number of PhD theses in any number of fields of learning Do you reckon anyone will know who Elmo is  years from now Neither do I But we still know Monkey today
if there is anyone around to know anything It is possible that Journey to the West is the most widely read or known text in the history of humanity Thats a bizarre thought to those of us brought up in the isolated shelter of JudeoChristian mythology Im sure it is less analyzed than the Christian bible
to quote Colin Hay Its about fantasy Its about delight in the sheer variety of the world around If I were a book
each told as a story such as an oral storyteller might relate Each chapter ends with a sort of cliffhanger and a directive to read on if you want to know what happens next In chapter  Monkey is born hatched  and asserts himself as a force to be reckoned with Hes fairly happy eating exotic fruits and being king of the mountain but eventually the idea of death occurs to him
and he gets quite naturally upset One of his monkey friends suggests to him that there are  kinds of beings who are free from the cycle of death and rebirth Buddhas
and Sages refers to Confucianism The Handsome Monkey King decides to set out on a journey to gain immortality Eventually after about  years have passed he runs into a Taoist Immortal who imparts the secrets of everlasting life and great travel powers to him Having acquired great cosmic powers
and soon comes to the attention of Heaven ie the Powers That Be Heaven attempts to placate Monkeys insatiable lust for power and recognition with a fake job and title Monkey can be fooled
in which the Bodhisattva Guanyin sets out on a journey to appoint a pure hearted priest to go west and bring back the scrolls of wisdom from the Buddhas Western Paradise On the way Guanyin flags a couple of demons to help the priest on his journey In chapters  through  we learn about Sanzang
the Tang Priest who is destined to recover the scriptures from the West
a mere mortal with no special powers of any kind His strength is the pureness of his heart and his faith in his mission The Journey to the West is Sanzangs voyage to recover the scrolls
not to mention deep dark forests and formidable mountain ranges However the Tang Priest quickly gets help
and a gluttonous moronic pigdemon who serves nicely as a luggage carrier But most importantly he acquires Monkey
learning to be a good Buddhist monk Imagine Monkey with a shaved head Once the cast is assembled
the journey begins in earnest Monkey
Sandy and the dragon horse accompany Sanzang through  miles of dangerous terrain
beset by evil spirits and demons at every turn By this time were done with chapter 
 pages into the novel
and Monkey gets lots of chances to show off his incredible magical powers
his sheer brute force
its not perfect On the other hand
but in others it excels them The paper is necessarily thin
but the books are tightly bound These are not massmarket paperbacks One does not feel that the books will fall apart on a second reading
Journey to the West is nicely illustrated with Qing Dynasty pictures The quality of the reproductions is not the highest
I can live with a couple of small physical flaws especially at this price Im just happy I got my grubby little monkey paws on it
what is right and what is wrong The horse is repentant of his crime and accepted his converted life as a horse
they are pure and righteous and changed over the course of the journey
and become Buddhas themselves This simple story is lesser known as a religious story
because of its exciting plot
is a little too good a translation The Chinese love their bureaucracy Numbers are very important and interesting to them as are titles and position Translating all the boring bits does not make for a good read
but it does make for an excellent insight into Chinese culture
not on a mythological level the rest of the novel does a great job of that but on the day to day level and how government affects their day to day life To that end
its a very good translation A bit boring at times
if youre not one for too much detail that bears little relevance to the plot Characters are named with grand titles but never appear again
while minor characters will receive fully fleshed out back stories that seem tangential to the original story but soon tie neatly in A very good set of books Interesting
but as pure as it can be to the source material without learning one of the most difficult languages in the world Also
to regain entry to Heaven they had to take sacred writings to the West travelling with a priest Now I loved this programme for several reasons
 the stories were wonderful  it had great action sequences  the acting was hilarious  it had a funky seventies discocheese soundtrack So little did I suspect that the story was an ancient tale by Chengen Wu  it took a friend from Japan to point it out Reliving my wasted youth  I ordered instantly from Amazon and have not been disappointed  these stories are wonderful and perfectly mixed my childhood afternoon TV sessions after school with my  year old mind and spirituality I still love Monkey
I have already read it several times and I think I will read it again some time Its a fun novel
presenting a real world through imaginary stories You will encounter demons sometimes
Though Journey to the West is immeasurably important in the history of fiction
the story itself is a classic
and downright confusing as an actual novel For instance
thats pretty interesting This serves as a transition into the actual story
which begins like so There was once a magic stone on the top of this mountain which was thirtysix feet five inches high and twentyfour feet round It was thirtysix feet five inches high to correspond with the  degrees of the heavens
but magic fungus and orchids clung to its sides Ever since Creation began it had been receiving the truth of Heaven
the essence of the Sun and the splendour of the Moon and as it had been influenced by them for so long it had miraculous powers It developed a magic womb
two beams of golden light shot towards the Pole Star palace Huh Why I assumed that the monkeys origin was in line with the mythical creator Pan Gus
the story suddenly grinds to a halt so that the narrator can expound an awkwardly translated poem Usually
this means pointing out every intricate detail of a characters outfit or a plot of land for no real reason Maybe it sounds wonderful in its original Chinese
As sweet and luscious as jade wine This goes on for a page and a half I think that just about explains it  That said
this novel has a major upside the actual story of the first seven chapters Though its largely considered a prologue by purists most of whom just Wikipedia summaries of chapter eight and up the wild adventure of Sun Wukong the monkey king
is the only part anyone really cares about Poetry and lackluster prose aside
Part One is one big swashbuckling adventure
following Wukongs rise to power and war against Heaven Its colorful
and the only section that follows a consistant plot It also contains some of the most famous moments in Chinese fiction
and one incredible chase sequence that really knocked me off my feet When Part One wraps up
everything goes downhill  The actual journey westward sees a main character switch and a change in format The alleged meatandpotatoes of the novel follows a monk named Xuanzang as he and his four desciples
there is no concept of coherence or character development Its entirely episodic and formulaic to a point where you can skip  of it and nothing will have moved forward Most of these episodes consist of Xuanzang being kidnapped by a monsteroftheweek and Wukong saving him while their comrades contribute little to nothing at all It gets old fast
and the overly direct translations dont help at all  There is very little reason to keep reading after Part One Some of the demons during the main quest are fun
campy fun  The Chinese animated film Havoc in Heaven is a beautiful rendering of Part One only  Arthur Waleys famous abridged version
also called Monkey cuts out most of the repitition and all of the poetry Its snappy
While the story is long and can get repetitive at times
it is a classic  If you wish to undersatnd the culture of China in any way
One of the best books Ive ever read I got hooked to the book the monment I read the first  pages
you will be thrilled with this book  Its  times more baddazzz than any related movie or cartoon you could hope to see I would compare it to the Oz books mixed with the Orlando epics
somewhat marred by a less than perfect translation although lets give credit where credit is due
i would not have liked to edit this book  this book reads somewhat like water  about two thousand pages of the narrative deals with the journey of Priest
and the end where they finally reach the Thunder Monastary on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven aka Tibet pretty much the rest of the book deals with the trials and tribulations that these four monks only three of which are fully developed characters poor Friar Sand is left as the fifth wheel most of the time go through in trying to fetch these scriptures for the enlightenment of all humanity  the priest is a real dingdong
so the Priest is always falling into the jaws of some new monster on virtually every chapter  the Pig is no better
as he would sooner run into trouble or create trouble for everyone else for the sake of either his pride or his stomach  the Monkey King is the real hero of this book
he is just kind of there to guide the Priests horse this book is definitely worth a read though
despite its short comings  the incessant poetry gets kind of annoying though
most of it is relevant to the plot so you cant really skip too much of it  i give it four stars
I got the product Journey to the West  volume boxed set fairly quickly
this doesnt bother me much as they would have been in this condition or worse after Ive finished it   Otherwise good service
Even people who dont have a scholarly or hobby interest in Chinese culture will enjoy this amazingly sassy
VERY VERY long epic about a quest to get instructions from the buddha  Magic animals
and other beings of all kinds  then you get the idea of just what a monumental book this is  Its like an encyclopedia written in the form of a novel  Its also the most famous fanatasy fiction in the Chinesespeaking world  Now thats a big deal The Buddhist monks mission is to walk all the way from the Chinese capital to India
the Hobbit to destroy it  The Monk is a man of great wisdom
who has limitless supernatural powers  Hobbits strength lies also in his purity of heart
which however fails only at the very end  Otherwise he is just as powerless as the Monk  Gandalf is the man of great wisdom and a tremendous wizard who assists Frodo  The Journey to the West is permeated throughout with Buddhist overtones and undertones  like blood in the human body
but the distinction between good and evil is no less sharp  All characters return home heroes Those whove read both books or at least seen the films adapted from them will appreciate the complexity of the Chinese imaginative mind  Nothing Tolkien wrote can compare  Curiously
very fast service,books in optimal condition
i chose it because im interested in china and im learning chinese and i like to read about places ive been in china
A Chinese born friend told me about this story and how it is the basis for the TV series Monkey The book compared to the TV show is a superior experience
This was purchased for my son for Christmas when I could not find it at the library  He loved it and was happy to find that it came with  other books from the series in a collector box
but the basic story is identical If you are a Dragon Ball fan
youll see where Im coming from This extremely long story about that old Chinese legend
inspired the great Akira in writing the greatest Japanese story ever written Mainly
Im going to but this story and see what else Akira based his popular Dragon Ball series on
I really love this company I will purchase from them again the book is as said in description very minor wear but everything else was in great condition
This translation is not as flowery as the Anthony Yu translation and does not have the extensive footnotes but is a fun read  Uses more modern language so its  not necessary to constantly look up references to understand the story
the order became lost in the mail I contacted Amazon with questions and options on what I could do to still receive this book set
and that set was received within a week Thanks for the great books
This is a wonderful translation of the Journey to the West  It is an unabridged translation
but it keeps the style of the original
meaning that interwoven between pharagraphs of prose are poems  This give the book a wonderful charm that the abridged
also give the book an authentic flavor that enriches the experience of reading this classic  It is still the same wonderful story of the michevous Monkey King
and his redeeming pilgramage with the Buddhist monkpriest Sanzang to find sutras  For anyone seriously interested in this story and who doesnt read Chinese
Delivery speed was ok Shipping rate was great considering the size and weight of this book collection Books quality is as expected for paper edition
The Journey to the West has remained of the most popular and enduring works of fiction in China since it was first published in the late sixteenth century  It is an allegory of Buddhist doctrine
a Chinese monk who traveled to India in search of religions scripture in I believe the seventh century  The very descriptive text contains some of the most astoundingly beautiful poetic passages I have ever encountered  Footnotes contain references to everthing from historical notes to daily customs of the period  This set of books is among the most treasured in my library
Anthony Yu version has more back ground info than WJFJ version The quality of books is very poor The paper quality is poor
printing quality is poor
and binding quality is poor However this is newer translation than Anthony Yu version  Though
I liked this book quite a bit The translation is good and the translator has one a great effort to explain as much as heshe could to help you to understand anything that is mentioned and you mey be unable to understand The only thing I found somewhat tiring was that the story becomes a little repetitive
but besides that the story is really interesting though I got to hate Pig
The classic novel Journey to the West is well worth a read if you like Chinese history
the novel overall is really interesting and I found most of it to be very engaging Even though Monkey is insanely overpowered
most of the time anyway Its a long story and some parts are very repetitive While this book is rich in detail and shows the incredible and complex Chinese Buddhist mythology and traditions beautifully
its obvious that the author had a real hatred of Taoists If youre a scholar of Buddhism or Chinese religions
but be aware of the biases The biggest problems I had were that this set of books the novel is split into four parts doesnt seem to have been proofread against typos and also seems to have been printed on quite lowquality paper Also
some of the translation notes are cut off or are missing Otherwise
this is a brilliant set of books Theyre well worth the price
I spent most of the train journeys reading this and bits of it are strange but it does link to the natural chinese history in ways which I was pleased about A decent read but not the best of the chinese classics
I bought this as a mothers day gift as this is one of her favourite stories she loved the old TV series and she absolutely loved it She spent the rest of the day annoying my Dad by reading out sections to him Well worth the money
but they probably were brilliant in the original language  such a shame
I give my review a fivestar rating because I really enjoy reading it  It has exceeded my expectations  I would certainly recommend to anyone who wants to have an understanding of a famous Chinese folklore  In fact
A wonderful rambling adventure
wit and insights into old China I never saw the popular TV series Monkey that came from this book
This is a lucid and superlative translation of this classic Chinese novel Arthur Waleys abridgment Monkeyis great for getting the flavour of Wu Chengens timeless novel but this complete translation by WJF Jenner
illustrated with many Ching period woodcuts
alchemical and Buddhist symbolism as we follow the way via many vicissitudes to the Western Heaven and the Greater Vehicle scriptures with our heroes
the monk Tripitaka who is a sort of everyman on the spiritual quest through life
who represents the mercurial mind so hard to control
and also the amazing magical powers of the immortal Taoist adept which nonetheless need to learn to be motivated and guided by the higher quality of Compassion and placed in the service of the enlightened Buddhanature Pigsy of course stands for the lower appetites and is a hilarious glutton and Friar Sand is a strange and earnest figure who defies definition It would be a faint spirit indeed who could not take pleasure in the cunning strategems and heroic antics of the irascible Monkey King
the Great Sage Equalling Heaven  these characters are archetypal aspects of each of us and their great quest mirrors the journey of the spirit This  volume translation is a joy to read and the exquisite poems which are embedded throughout really add to the full appreciation of this wonderful and intricate novel Like The Golden Ass of Apuleius it is richly humorous but beneath the phantastic episodes and the wild japes there is a serious message and purpose and the Journey to the West is a profoundly spiritual novel Was there ever a hero like the Handsome Monkey King
and comics eg Dragonball and is starting with its creation in the th century certainly one of the most influential pieces of literature  even if outside of China most people have seldom heard of it The edition in hand is quite comprehensive
which makes the reading a bit strenuous in parts For this  not for the quality of the work itself  one star has been deducted
Im still on Book One and Im finding it a great read  I havent been this engrossed in a mythical work since Lord of the Rings  This work predates that great work by centuries  I love the mix of poetry and prose
The books are awesome The product came very quickly and in pristine condition
on time and at a good price
This is a distillation of Yus faithful translation of the  chapter
part mythical epic of Chinese literature which has been the basis for numerous movies
are condensed to  most of the trimming comes after the divine monk Tripitaka Tang sets out to bring Buddhist scriptures from India back to China
since his encounters with obstacles become a bit repetitive in the long version The monk is actually the incarnation of a Heavenly being who volunteered to suffer human birth in order to bring the means of enlightenment to the people of the East But once he is mortal he will lose his divine perceptions and be vulnerable to illusions
thereby winning their freedom to return to their former estates This assignment is made difficult by several factors At least two of the disciples loathe each other and are forever squabbling and fighting Pigsy is lazy and wants to go back to eating meat and having sex Monkey wants to go back to being King of the Flower Fruit Mountain Only the gold fillets that act like th century tasers keep the unruly disciples from rebellion Thieves and politicians bar their way The major difficulty
for it is widely known that even one mouthful of Tripitakas flesh will prolong life
when they dont simply capture the travelers by a frontal assault The story is magnificent adventure
and braggadocio exchanges between combatants It is so refreshing to encounter a classic that isnt inherently a tragedy based on war or lust for power
this epic centers around a quest to benefit all of creation by promoting enlightenment In the style of the poems included in this translation
One of four magical beings who serve and guard Tripitaka Tang on his quest for scriptures Not always willingly Pigsy loves earthy pleasures
First off Im really glad this was an abridgment the chapter
but classic books are at time more difficult to digest than modern novels Secondly
remember that this story is hundreds of years old Some of the storytelling styles are oldschool If youve read other ancient books and stories
you might know what I mean Its not organized the way a modern story might be
it had its own religious goals as well But dont forget to enjoy the ridiculous antics the characters often take part in This leads me to my next point it helped me to have some background knowledge before reading this book While the translatoreditor of this book adds a few footnotes
and ancient China But no worries on becoming an expert This is still an enjoyable story
This labor of love from Anthony Yu is an amazing translation for English readers  In the preface Mr Yu discusses his reasons for wanting to provide a culturally accurate translation for English readers  Being a native speaker of Chinese and growing up in the culture as well as being a professor of Asian studies and history in an English speaking country is really what makes this translation so amazing  The footnotes at the bottom of each page were an especially nice detail Oftentimes with weighty classics like this all the footnotes are either at the end of the book with the appendices or at the end of the chapter  This leads to a lot of fumbling around and flipping pages back and forth and can subsequently take you out of your reading experience  It is also easier
to forget some of the context of what I was reading doing all this flipping back and forth  Not only do the footnotes themselves add immensely to the depth of understanding of the material but having them at the bottom of the page they are referencing makes reading easy and enjoyable  Culture specific footnotes really helped me understand the intensity of the situations I was reading about as well as just how funny this book is As far as the story itself I think everyone should read it  The story is hilarious and surprisingly modern in its storytelling despite the time it was written  So many of the most famous animes in pop culture clearly have taken major inspiration from this story  DBZ alone has ripped off so many elements youll find yourself laughing at the similarities if you have ever watched DB or DBZ Highly
This long but nevertheless abbreviation of the Chinese classic story of the journey from China to India of the Buddhist monk Tripitaka to bring to China manuscripts of the teachings of the Buddha The characters are spectacular
especially Monkey whose magical performances save the mission from disaster The bizarre adventures involving magic and courage are at times very amusing and always astonishing at the invention and imagination of those who wrote this amazing and highly readable
this is just not an entertaining read for me  The humor may bring a chuckle to Asian readers of the th century Ming dynasty but this is way too dry for me  I would suggest checking it out from a library prior to purchasing it to see if it is what you expected  Just because everyone else tells you that the monkey is handsome dont believe them
GREAT book I have never read the  version but I imagine it must leave out a LOT Considering Anthony C Yus full unabridged version is  times the length of his here abridged version
this version is a great starting point A must read for all interested in Chinese literature and a MUST for all Dragonball fans You really get a sense of Goku and his world by reading this classic epic story
Good translation and the abbreviated version maintains the spirit and I dont feel like I miss much by not purchasing each individual tome
You probably need to appreciate ancient Chinese culture and its historic interaction with Buddhism to appreciate this novel This was a delightful journey with a group of colorful characters that keep struggling to learn and grow The rhythm of the story telling becomes a fun structure for these little adventures I didnt miss the unabridged version for a moment
Incredibly well written such that it seems to preserve the culture and voice of the original work It is excellent
who loved it as well Great story to share with your kids Recommend it all over the place
and the tales found within are both seminal works of Chinese literature and rewarding reads in and of themselves  For this particular edition
Anthony Yu does a good job of translating into English the prose text is very readable
and Yus footnotes provide a lot of help on obscure references to Chinese superstitions and Buddhist heritage  The translations of the poems are somewhat less satisfying
and I found myself frequently skipping over them to read just the prose storyline  My main complaint is with the books Yu decides to include here out of the  chapters of the full edition
especially for anyone looking for the middle ground between the comic book versions and the full volume chapter text
I was sad when I got to the end that there was no more Its amazing it was written hundreds of years ago and still has relevant moderns themes and insights The mix of Taoism
Buddhism and Confucianism is special Such an unusual story of myth
If a story seemed too long because of the vast amount of volume and you just want a good read in one book This is it Journey to the West is an epic that needs to be read and this is the version to read in one go
This is a superb printing of this translation in a manageable soft cover
Anthony Yu indeed is an excellent translator
summing up the most essential chapters to give a flavor of the importance spiritual depth of this book It will engage readers to want to study further in his full translation version
This is the best translation you will find Anthony C Yu has really made this book shine
it displays all that only people who can read Chinese could only know until now ,previous books in English on the monkey king have been dry and lacking in spirit this book is beautifully descriptive and spiritually deep at the same time,but dont let the word spiritual throw you off this book is full of adventure and excitement
not a boring moment to be found PS this is the abridged version of the  volume full versionI usually dont bother with abridged books but got this one to read to my son,not only does my son love this,but I love just as much as the whole set
I thought it would be fun to reread the abridged version when it came out As far as I can tell
This an abridgement of a famous Chinese novel beloved by kids and adults all over as Asia Unfortunately this a not very readable translation that appears to be aimed at scholars
The choice of multisylabic  words where simple words There is also a lot a obscure Buddhist and  Taoist poetry interspersed in the text that I could not head nor tails of Very distracting from the story
This book is a great book to use to learn about Chinese culture The story here is a classical of Chinese literature and is written in a way that makes it clear for anyone to understand A good read
TMatM tells a story that happens to be one of the most wellknown tales in Asia The Monkey Kings Journey to the West The story is profound and funny  and very different from any tale you may hear in this  side of the globe By reading it
you get to know a lot about the basis of a whole culture The Monkey King was the inspiration  direct or otherwise  for many mang creators Suggested for people who are really interested in the Asian culture
Mr Yu already translated the entire book and did it very well That translation has been extant for around  years So why publish only a little readers digest condensed one I want the whole thing for my Kindle I would be happy to pay commensurately with the increased volume Come on give us a break
and perdition rather than up and over the fabled hill of Sisyphus to the Shangrila realm of Asklepios and Panacea The tamed Monkey controlled initially by a fillet and later by himself represents the victory of Buddhisms metaphorical immortality over Taoisms failed experiments in real immortality  Had Tony Yu made this point in his preface
 The translation is poor  For example
Yu translates that into old Monkey  This is just dumb  Something like a plain I or this old monkey would have worked better  There are many such examples  The translated English text almost requires you to know Chinese to understand  Definitely not for the masses  I cant believe most of the stories in the nd half of the original novel are omitted  This abridged edition seems to focus on the first half of the Xiyouji Journey to the West novel  Great stories like the Ox King and the nymphs are completely cut out  This is just absolutely terrible  On the other hand
Chinese poems shi and ci that are extremely difficult to translate which should have been left out of an abridged edition In short
dont get this book  Its absolutely terrible and a waste of money  You might as well get the unabridged translation
by either Yu expensive or by Waley old but affordable  But if you really want to appreciate the great novel
you should study Chinese  years fulltime and then read the original Chinese edition
NOT THE FULL TEXTthese are the  cliff notesproduct page is awful
This is the single best translation of The Art of War  the one used in history courses and the military Why Because its JUST The Art of War No long intros No authors notes No commentary No  pages of history or Sun Tzu biography Its simply the text of The Art of War translated by an international group of Chinese and Englishspeaking scholars Period Its the definitive text Complaining about it being short is like complaining about the Gettysburg Address being short It IS short Thats the POINT If you want to read dozens of pages of commentary and history and footnotes and acknowledgements
 page cliffnote version And itd be nice if they listed that pertinent fact in the headline  Kinda just a waste of resources sending it back
and all types of other endeavors Its a little difficult to just read however it has tons of wise principles You do have to think somewhat abstractly in order to benefit from this book
but overall I think its worth having and worth reading Certainly not the type of book you would read like anovel
I really appreciate having read this book It oriented my mind in a favorable way towards using and thinking about certain mindfulnessbased strategical tactics I appreciate the guidance and motivational support written within the pages This was a quick
easy read for me and will be a lasting reference for years to come I highly suggest this to everybody It is a classic mustread in my opinion I was not compensated in any way for this review I like to give open
honest and transparent feedback about products I like to try I hope you found this review to be useful If so
This was an incredibly economical buy A good price on a legendary literary work However
it is simply The Art of War by Sun Tzu The quality of the print is very good and the material seems to all be there
there are many blank pages as shown in the attached image Again
I did not notice any material actually missing or out of context I would not purchase this book if you are looking to reference it for scholarly sources or any work in which you would have to reference the content directly I would definitely encourage the buy if it is for personal use or work that does not require proper citations
you NEED to read this book If you are the type of leader that is too nice and you feel like your employees take advantage of you
you NEED to read this book This is how this book changed my life My first big promotion was getting the General Manager position of a restaurant at  years old
I got them equipment and supplies they need to do a good job
etc I was the nicest boss who was also turning out to be a pushover You can have all the kindness in the world but it makes your team useless if you have no discipline at the same time The Bible says God disciplines His children BECAUSE He loves us Otherwise
and NEITHER DID MY TEAM Why would they respect me I thought discipline was bad punishment you gave and punishment was mean Nope turns out every team needs it
and if you are CONSISTENTLY and FAIRLY giving predictable and forewarned discipline all the time
you will have an amazing team This is my favorite quote from the book that finally turned the light bulb on for me  Page   If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you
its discipline will be bad If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed
Im not going to lie it shocked them a bit and they didnt believe when me I would tell them I would be disciplining them if they didnt follow through or finish a direct order I had given them I had to fire one manager who was undermining me to the team
and then if and when the time comes for the formal discipline
and you are only following through on what you said would happen There are SO MANY MORE GREAT QUOTES in this book Just get it Get a highlighter and pick out the diamonds that you need Go over them time and again and become the amazing leader of your life and of your team you are meant to be
who is in ministry and all  campuses of her ministry are required to study this book She received a flimsy pamphlet
and we cannot go out and purchase the book for her to have immediately This was a huge waste
As a person who has a  passion for reading I am also a young teenager who is often times lost on what direction to go in life After reading this book and studying the literature within this ancient book I feel like I can accomplish my hardest challenges
Very nice and great for desktop but i didnt realize it was a tiny version I order these leather look books all the time and they are always standard to large size so my bad for not reading the description That said
nice product and great to just toss around on a desktop or whatevertoo small for a bookshelf Love it
keeping and reading it but a little pricey for th size as i get full size volumes for my collection all the time for this price
I really wish I had read all the reviews before purchasing this It is all things you can find online for free  pages of wide set typing and this authors take on what is actually in the real book This thing is TINY because it is not the entire text This is really false advertising I didnt want a book report by an unknown source
Do not buy this book Its a small preview of the real Art of War book Consider this if you get this book its about  total pages The real Art of War is  pages That means if you buy this book youll be missing  pages from the real book Thats a lot of important information This is a scam book
you must be ready and be willing to be a fighter like the wind
This Audio Book has no commentary and is the writings of The Art of War by Sun Tzu only I have The Art of War in written form with and without Commentary and frankly like the version without commentary better I really like this Audio version The reader has a good voice
easy to follow reading This is a small audio book but very enjoyable and still instructional I have listened to this several times and still learn and just plain enjoy the reading  At  years old that sometimes isnt easy with some Audio Books I have I do recommend this one You can download this into Media Player and make a Playlist
a year old It was free
just figured Id mention it if you plan on coming out with a new edition at some point Sorry
This was selfpublished To make some money I suppose Nothing wrong with that But it shows poor editing A number of misspelled words and a few other errors that could have been detected if the editing were better
This is one of those books that should be a mandatory read in school
probably high school in order to have the students understand the ideas and concepts presented I finally read this book after retiring from work and found that a lot of the ideas such as the one who plans beforehand will succeed were things I learned while working and some of the rest were more or less common sense If more people read this while they were teenagers
the Art of War by Sun Tzu is a concise treatise packed with wisdom  Countless reams of scholarly research has been generated in the millenia since Sun Tzu wrote this masterpiece Unfortunately
this edition seems to jam all of that research as inline notes into the text itself  It is virtually impossible to distinguish what Sun Tzu wrote contrasted against what someone else wrote about Sun Tzu  The research is good its just impossible to read through I tried to read this
but got so fed up that I edited of the Art of War with all of the notes and research linked into an appendix instead of inline with the text  As a result
I should  If you prefer this free edition
The book is a shortened version I thought this was the full version Amazon let me return it with no issues The book was in great condition and would have been perfect if it was the full version
Theres a reason this is a classic However this copy ups it quite a bit by making the page font not to big but not trying to smash as must text together as possible I found the read enjoyable Great words of wisdom inside
which is great given COVID Definitely add this to your book collection
The delivery was quick  the book arrived in great condition it was new The Art of War I have heard this book quoted often It has some medium and some very interesting parts Many broad generalizations To apply it to business is malpractice too Machivalian It is a quick read and I recommend it just to be well rounded in a literary sense I have heard it described as the ramblings of a retired General which seems accurate I recommend reading it
THIS BOOK IS NOT CLIF NOTES This is The Art of War as written by Sun Tzu and translated to English This version however does not include the commentary by the translator There has been many versions of The Art of War translated into English over the years by many different people and all of them will vary in length The bulk of the book that people are talking about is the sometimes  pages of commentary by the translator and in some editions a  page forword and sometimes a  page introduction This is the bare bones unabridged edition of The Art of War as written by Sun Tzu and translated into English You are not missing any content from The Art of War itself You are just missing in my opinion meaning was commentary from the translator and any forwards or introductions some versions may have As far as Sun Tzus writings they are fully intact
pay better attention than I did
ISBN  I bought this book and it was seriously shorter than I thought It is the book with a black cover and white font on it It had absolutely no commentary or anything in it Just the stuff by Sun Tzu Stillits so short I guess for the price it makes sense As for word choice in this particular book
Wikipedia had better translations of the chapters For example
Attack by Stratagem It feels so clumsy compared to Strategic Attack With the amount of blank pages in the bookafter every chapter
they could have easily filled in the original Chinese for side by side comparison I probably would have just read this online A paper copy is good to have around
but because the price is cheap
the book paper quality is cheap as well There seems to be little effort in formatting too The book is in an ubiquitous font like Times New Roman This book simply did not fit my needs for the reasons above
and I will probably be searching for another book However if you are looking to have a simple copy of The Art of War in paperback form
Great book a lot of knowledge on how cut throat the world is
The Art of War is the book for both military history buffs and would be business leaders since the principles and strategies outlined by Sun Tzu are applicable on the battle field and in the meeting room That being said
bogging down the flow and relatively easy understand original language In fact
it is the clear and simple way Sun Tzu expressed his rules that has made his book so popular and relevant for the past  years or so The solution is straight forward enough since the translation is good
all of the text is there and it is easy enough to skim through Mr Clearys contributions Recommended
nothing really to complex or difficult to understand Basis of this book is that it was written in China over two thousand years ago
Sun Tzus The Art of War provides the first known attempt to formulate a rational basis for the planning and conduct of military operations His essays contain principles acted upon by such twentiethcentury Chinese generals as Mao Zedong The book is translated by the late Samuel B Griffith Samuel Griffith offers an insightful translation of this classic
which makes it even more relevant to the modern world If you are taking a class and need the book or just want to brush up on your twentieth century military tactics
many military organizations and many successful generals have read and benefitted from this work  Based on their reputations
depending on what they experience I have to take off one star  The free Kindle edition has an overly long introduction plus a large amount of inbody notes  The inbody notes look way to similar to the text  I want to read more of Sun Tzus words
Life handing you nothing but lemons Need to get the upperhand Eager to learn how to walk that fine line that makes the difference between winning or losing Then this is the book to read Want to learn how to always come out on topno fussno muss Then READ THIS BOOK  The Art Of War is a howtomanual for difficult situations Learn how to handle a situation without the situation handling youlearn how to handle a situation correctly The wisdom in this book is solid
but its actually a pretty tactical book on the details of prosecuting a war  Its one of those books that is so broadly read and studied that its pretty necessary background for studying wars generally  If you are reading other books on war for example
theres just a lot of interesting advice in here
There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare and thus there are instructions on how important it is to bring a conflict to a head and a swift conclusion  Its a classic for a reason
It is just a confusing translation
I read it before in other language and it had more context and content
the best option would be to learn Chinese and study the original text Short of that
a good translation is required If Mr Giles is a good translator
hes a horrible editor This edition uses no style markings to denote what is from the original or what is editorial As you can see by viewing the first few pages on this items page
you can see that everything runs together The reader cant possibly get a feel for the style or composition of the original because the entire text is peppered with commentary
or index Keep looking if youre interested in reading Sun Tzus masterpiece Ill update this review when Ive found an edition suitable for reading and recommendingthis one is going back to Amazon today
but this does not hurt the content of the text Seems as if this publisher is a bit of a dice roll with what some of the other reviews are saying
thats what you get cheap stuff I think this was literally printed on standard bond print paper in  pt times new roman or something more like a pamphlet than a book
I was looking to reference the Art of War by Sun Tzu so I decided to order a copy I must say that this is only a Part of the original
its a weird fake abbreviated version
either badly autotranslated or generated using synonyms from an existing translation to avoid copyright issues
its literally junk and doesnt make sense Sample sentence the highquality issue of all is to take the enemys united states of america entire and intact Really bugs me that Amazon allows this kind of thing to slide
practical advise imparted in this book is still relevant today and is applicable to every instance of human competition known your enemy as you know yourself
The Kindle version of the book is missing spaces between words  With this deficiency layered on the authors frequent bracketed interjections
the core message is all but unintelligible for me as a first time reader of the Art of War and novice in Chinese history and historical geography  The author seeks to improve upon previous translations by pulling the best from each
and contextualizing  This noble purpose may have backfired because I am leaving this version of the book feeling I should have read Tu Mus version
which the author quoted frequently and which seems lucid and easy to understand
Art of War is an ancient Chinese text on the practice of warfare
both physical and psychological While much of the treatise is metaphorical in expression
with a little critical thinking the axioms of warfare are true in many aspects of life This edition includes many annotations which relate the expressions to other Chinese texts on martial activities and commentaries on the manuscript itself
the values which are promulgated therein can be readily applied to principles of business
A very abridged version of the writings Lots of lists of the key points Good as a quick reference but not the fully written out philosophy  Sort of the Cliff Notes version
Sunzi was renowned for his battle strategies and philosophies His writing are among the classics of must read art of warfare around today regardless of how many thousands of years old it may be This book provide readers with the understanding of war
how to attack and enemy and how to defeat an enemy I am a warrior at heart and in practice I work in a field of enforcement so knowing my enemy and well as knowing myself is a real philosophy Keep my friends close and my enemies closer another aspect of this war masters doctrine
Dont let the  star reviews scare you This is the complete addition Sun tzu wrote on chop sticks so it is written like little words of wisdom Its not a traditional book that is going to teach you how to win a war If the reader is looking for wisdom
but since theres not a lot of printing info its hard to that being said It was produced professionally at a notably low price for a new book  Was a superior reading experience than printing the text offline and reading that way Recommended for anyone who wants to bust through a common classic text For me its a primer for pursuing an older edition
much less expensive  I am glad I read the other book I mentioned with the background material and analysis  The original script is an ancient writing
and a little difficult to understand without some background or comment  I suggest that if you want to understand the meanings of Sun Tzu more fully
I might be better suited for wars It was still a good purchase though No regerts  stars Must read NY Times bestseller fo sho
and the advertising is extremely misleading in this sense Who would order a book just to read a summary I managed to cancel my purchase
but I am confused about how the average review appears to be  stars
not mentioning this specific product Very misleading
The book arrived sooner than expected so was able to add it to the birthday gifts for the  year old grandson Since he is all about playing with military toys and mounting pretend battles This will be a great  addition to the basic principles hell learn from the  BABY which is really fine for kids to age  or so version of The Art of War which he can read and understand now
which is formatted perfectly well with the lists and punctuation all in place and the illustrations coming out viewable and intelligible on both my iPad and Kindle Touch st gen Sun Tzus Art of War is a timeless classic with much of its philosophy still applicable
as geography is not much an issue in modern warfare
this book is the general guide for every situation we will encounter in life not only at war In simple words it will show you why so many military campaigns have failed such as Vietnam or to be more current the war on the Middle East
every household must read this book and keep it close as a reference whenever we dont know how to proceed with difficult decisions or challenges
but you can apply this to almost any endeavor and learn how to win consistently It teaches you that winning is mostly about preparation
with examples  Be aware this is a translation from ancient Chinese
so the translator has inserted notes about the difficulty of translating the true meaning of certain passages  However
in all he does a great job  This is the book that ALL great generals have read Charge on
This book is not only a great read about military strategies but about how to keep house in your life and business
This is NOT the version of ART OF WAR that most people are searching for  Perhaps Amazon should include a page count in the description  This version is more like a pamphlet with a glossy cover  The information is very simple translation of military strategy taken from ancient text  Nothing contained in these pages pertain to the life of a modern day person  If thats what you are seekingfind a different version
Flipping through it I glean bits and pieces of an organized mind I can easily understand why this book has existed for more than  years My intention is to read it a little at a time so that I absorb some of the philosophy I am not interested in war but I am interested I how men think and plan
and drawn from real life experience
Sun Tzus lessons can be applied effectively in any life situation involving  or more peoplethe more adversarial
the better LOL Sun Tzu has stood by me through thick and thinhis sage advice has made a big difference in my personal approach to business deals
and you have to be willing to be adversarial to get what you need This is a worthwhile read for ANYONEboth from an advice and tactics point of view
and excellent use of metaphor I have yet to run into a BAD translation of Tzu
This is considered a long time classic  Rightfully so  It is a book with many interpretations and you will take away the ones you see as useful to your situation  That being said more of the concepts may apply  Sun Tzu wrote this book about matters he considered serious so even being a short book by todays standards it applies to important matters it is read and studied a most major military higher training facilities the world over  The applications are not just military but can be applied to any situation where there is a conflict between two entities
I downloaded this book for my son  He is a gamer  He thought it would help him and he is constantly testing lessons learned  I think this is an awesome book for kids that cant stay away from a gaming console for more than a few minutes  I wish there were more books that could get my kids to read voluntarily
My bad for not reading the description this thing is just a little pamphlet buddy to the actual real version that i see that i still need to buy  for thisnot even worth the price of return shippinglol whatever
its got nice thicker pages and doesnt get all bent up in the corners The content is legendary and will give you insight to anything you do in life
Cheap and quick in its arrival Now for the book you should read it as there is some advice that applies to everyone even if they arent competing or going to war
by the Chinese General SUN TZU I was introduced to this book in martial arts studies and later was again introduced to the book in business as a tool for planning business strategy Examples Know the Enemy This is the first of SUN TZUs rules for successful warfare Know Yourself The second part of SUN TZUs rule is to know yourself strengths and weaknesses Presented this book to business friends and martial artist Have two hardback and this Kindle Copy enjoycas
This short book takes a primer approach to being a general and leader in war  I cant see how it would be an essential element of turning anyone into a successful general  You can learn most of the basic lessons presented by Sun Tzu by playing war or cowboys  indians in the mountains of Pennsylvania  If you had a deprived childhood your Mom  Dad kept guns away from you and did not allow you to play violent childhood games
I recommend you read the book and pay attention to basic tactics and the value of planning and using all available resources  Because it is short and instructional it should be a quick read and worth your time even if you read it only to satisfy your curiosity  I was a bit disappointed
given the hype of the book  The general repeats himself and often makes a big deal of the obvious If you want to become the next General Macarthur or General Patton
make better use of your time and look elsewhere  If you think there is a need for another Napolean type
I shouldve read product description before buying I wouldve found that the book here is  pages and just a gist of the original
This book is a good tool for former and present leaders No matter the environment whether in a business or any other functional set up
The ideas presented in Sun Tzus Art of War are still applicable to the st century  Reading Sun Tzus words can open your mind to what life presents to us on a daily basis  Taking that statement one step further  we have to become cognizant to our surroundings environment and the people in our circle of friends or colleagues at work  Rereading the Art of War will give you a deeper insight and understanding of the meaning behind the words  Once you open yourself  many things only become clear  You might say  food for thought
 however the formatting of this version is terrible  The first  pages are unorganized and poorly written analyses of the art of War  Moreover
this version is devoid of the fancy bells and whistles features in other ebooks such as a table of contents
 etc If youd like to get to the actual Sun Tzu text open this ebook and do a search on your kindle for I  Laying  without the quotation marks Other than the aforementioned problems this is an exact replica of the Giles translation of the art of War you get what you pay for
Because of the illustrations I downloaded The Art of War to the Kindle Fire HD  Quite pleased with the presentation and the formatting As for the text of the book itself
this book is easily understood in terms of life in general and great for business majors
business or the military you will find the thoughts of General Sun Tzu quite enlightening and useful in strategy and tactics  The unfortunate thing for military folks is that civilians and generals in a building thousands of miles away from the danger have far too much say in the actions on the battlefield and reveal that they obviously have no knowledge of General Tzus teachings
which if employed could save lives and shorten wars A quick and easy read at a reasonable price
but all the setup seems unnecessary and somewhat irritating  I already had a pretty good idea about Sunzi and strictly wanted to read his teachings  I think
but it would come with a strong warning about the setup and the seemingly constant commentary
and for the most part few actually review the product itself This particular eBook is thick with indepth information on Art of War and its author It takes about  chapters to even begin to reach the chapter First a discussion of Sun Tsus existence
its really informative but I just wanted the  chapters If you think youd be apply to just push through the square bracket passages be ready for a real challenge Id want to rate it  to offset the other ratings but this edition isnt that bad
I took the course a long time ago  This is THE BEST synopsis I have come across  If you study this little book it will open almost any door for you and allow you to WIN easily  It may be applied to business
sports and personally if you follow the principles set forth in this easy to read and understand strategy
Reads like a long series of sometimes insightful and sequential
Easy to read Great content Highly recommended Can use these strategies at modern workplaces
This is the book people leaving the comfort of home to go into the real world  This book is where military and industry management education begins the world over Redundant but also if you read about the time frame and the history of that part of the world you will see how well the idea works This book illustrates how going forward is done if getting the job done is all that matters  If you also read books on world leaders and military leaders you will see how they applied the process
the book was in good condition and a nice price to boot it came in a timely fashion as well
Didnt realize it came in two books No big deal at all
The narration for Sun Tzus Art of War by Tantor Abridged is excellent It does more than justice to the original novel
and even provides side notes of interesting commentary by other historically significant characters generals
warlords and others who have noted on the word of Sun Tzu and even accounts of real battle applications Definitely worth the price I enjoyed every minute of this work
it was a very enjoyable experience
without the access to study legions of greats before him could have so many practical ideas that would truly stand the test of time referring to the fact that he would become one of the greats and was born before major peers in Europe or elsewhere would even be born What some say about being able to use his ideas in other areas
not specifically about how to win a war on th  battlefield Mustread for any student of history
The book Art of War written by Sun Tzu is military treasure trove of military tactics  This is a stunning display of  chapters that were written over  years  The chapters in this book describe one of the worlds greatest generals philosophy on war and strategy The book discusses different ways to command troops and the pitfalls associated with war  Sun Tsu states that the faster your troops move
the more troops are lost in the process  The authors philosophy here is to show that more careful planning to military strategy will save lives and hopefully achieve success on the battlefield The Art of War can be applied to life in general and not just military tactics  Taking ones time in planning will lead to less strife
and reaching ones goals  This book is a great read for anyone interested in military strategy and philosophy  I highly recommend it
This is a great book on Chinese history and the basic principles to the strategy of war It is the words of the great general Sun Tzu from the Warring States Period in ancient China around bc This is particular edition is very clear and precise
as well as books on warfare I would recommend reading every line over until you grasp what Sun Tzu was trying to say I would also think it beneficial if you followed up reading a more through edition
perhaps the  hard cover edition of The Illustrated Art of War by Samuel Griffith
piece of Chinese literature that is a great intro to the philosophy of warfare which can be applied to everyday life and leadership
Sun Tzus maxims and insights are timeless  Centuries after it was written
The Art of War is required reading for warriors and still taught as part of the central curriculum at military academies around the world  The insights are timeless
Good for a short version  Chapter  was missing from my copy
This version is the  chapters without the lengthy introductions
When you interpret what is said it all makes sense I did a quick read and then went back and reread will be a great reference book You could use the information in war or business its all in how you use it
Quality and translation are reasonable
but not super bad No prologue
no epilogue nothing but the main text and index All in all
This book contains only Sun Tzus original thoughts on war and does not have any comentary added about his observations  It does not paraphrase or compare it to business models or any other inspirational theme  I enjoyed the plain information and reading this mans observations and deductions about how to win a war was very interesting and gave me lots of insights into humans and war Quite recommended just for the concepts provided
A great reference book Would recommend
A book everyone must read at least once in their life A great teaching of life
however you pronounce the ideogram  produced in a few chapters one of the seminal works on conflict and one of the oldest works on the subject that is as relevant today as it was when it was written
this book is a steal i dont care about the negative reviews talking about editions and nitpicking and what not this is a great price and also the best looking cover to any art of war book out there simplistic and impacting very appealing and at a very veryyy affordable price i havent read it yet but i know what to expect i suggest buying it you really have nothing to lose
Appears to be the same version that appears under multiple different entries when you search for The Art of War on Amazon Doesnt appear to be full text and there are noticeable typos note heading numbered 
but it is nice to see from such a point of view I received and read this book all in one day It is not very long
but wasnt expecting Cliff notes version of the book  On the flip side of that
I cant say Im terribly dissatisfied because Im sure Ill enjoy the knowledge it offers  Although
it may be aplicable to daily life and business Of course with regard to life and business the goal must be to prevail without brutality and killing This book also showes that war should always be a last option because once engaged it must be fought with all the brutality man can concieve Simply put dont go to war unless you mean to prevail If you engage you must be prepaired to do all that is necessary to win A must read for our polititians Not an easy read
which is an honorific given to the author
and which version is correct There is also the matter of the proper translation The one I read was translated by Lionel Giles in  It is one of the most
if not the most influential text on military strategy and tactics Mao Zedong
Vo Nguyen Giap and Douglas MacArthur are only three of the many military leaders who credit the importance of Sun Tzu work in guiding their thinking It remains an essential textbook at the military colleges in the United States
and which I had had some personal experience with Never fight on a battlefield that resembles an inverted tortoise shell  I didnt find the quote
but perhaps I found the opposite At least the tortoise shell reference SOUNDS like something he might have said The author did grab my attention with an anecdote in the introduction which underscored one of his aphorisms If words of command are not clear and distinct
each led by one of the emperors favorite concubines Because they could not maintain proper discipline among their troops
despite the protests of the emperor It should be no surprise that their replacements achieved perfect discipline within the ranks
who proclaimed the army ready
in the real world
can keep his own head is not discussed in the text There is much wisdom in this text For example All warfare is based on deception There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare On a good leader Hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilize combined energy And one that Vo Nguyen Giap must have taken to heart Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory
the one passage that seemed closest to addressing this issue seemed to imply the opposite Pass quickly over mountains
facing the sun Do not climb heights in order to fight So much for mountain warfare Certainly Giap seemed to have disregarded that one And there seems to be that classic problem of all too many holy books There are passages that imply this
and passages that imply the opposite of this  For example
and Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy One cartload of the enemys provisions is equivalent to twenty of ones own  But on the other hand We may take it then that an army without its baggagetrain is lost
without provisions it is lost without bases of supply it is lost There is much good advice that seems to be routinely ignored
youre better off finding a free pdf version than paying money for this overblown brochure
Seriously simple read that will help you whether the need arises to lay siege to a walled city or the normal day to day confrontations we all have  Its really a book of proverbs on who is likely to win a battle and why  Whatever those battles are
while latter parts of the book goes flat latter on with lines of wisdom
If you are in to this type of book highly recommended Shipped and received quickly too
I got this for my husband and he really enjoyed reading it It is exactly what the title says it is Its a classic and that is why my husband wanted it The price on this book is great It a nice binding for as inexpensive as it is If you are looking for a short classic about ancient war strategies this book will fit that need
A terrible condensed version It reads like a college students study notes
This book is a fine distillation of skill gleaned from vast experience on the field of battle Much of the instruction revolves around actually avoiding battle and the carnage of war It has become an inspiration and map for building strategy in managing people It seems to me when words passed down through many generations remain relevant
words to live by in this cut throat corporate world
as well as every day dealings with the people around us,Never be taken advantage of,Always have the upper hand,be in a position of command  control General Sun Tzu is a visionary way ahead of his time 
is a must read for any person who battles If you know someone you call friend who has not read The Art of War it is your duty to get them a copy of the book There is more to a fight than the fist or weapon It all starts in the mind of one or more beings An ancient lesson uncontrolled anger against a real or imagined enemy is what will destroy us long before the foe
Its an abridged version
Not the full length book Nothing in the description says this is a short summary of the actual book Very disappointed
The translation in this copy is awful
and instead includes the phonetic spelling of the Chinese character I think that ought to give you a flavor for how this reads Terrible
This is easily the best book on strategy and war that I have  The format is good enough for me  A must have in every collection
One of the best books for anyone to read for almost any reason The Art of War has many teachings and life lessons for every single person that only can aid in your journey through life
This is a great pocket version of The Art of War there are no notes or additional interpretations
so it is not a scholarly study of the text
I have listened to this book on audible but I did purchase this book just for reference This book is a powerful book
We as humans have been killing each other for centuries The author just refined the process of how to best do it in his time Well done
Arrived on time in perfect condition I only gave the product four stars because its a very thin book in person I always thought that it was thicker
like a novel This version is quite thin and seems like a book of lists of Sun Tzus teachings I bought this book so I could have a copy of my own
One of the classic treatises on managing ultimate human conflict You dont read this for entertainment But if you are in any way involved in a battleground
whether its on a real battlefield with real weapons
I think everyone in general should read this book Great book for understanding war strategy and can definitely be applied to everyday life
but as part of a political strategy group was required to read it  While I strongly believe in the virtues and power of Love and Forgiveness
being prepared and understanding your opponents weaknesses is vital  This is a short book and packed with wisdom
this book is a treasure worthy sharing through the ages
Read this book and it changed my live in  Bought it because I read it from the Library Taoism and eastern philosophy has the greatest approach to the battle within
It would be foolish for someone to claim superior knowledge over the author of this treatise of tactics and wisdom in the Art of War Sun Tsu has been studied for centuries now and to date there has been no one that has been able to best perhaps the move brilliant tactician of all time Though the book is relatively short
This guy was light years ahead of his time His battles depended on mostly tactics based on what the weather conditions were
BS His tactics are still put to good use even to this very day
is an extremely complex and pragmatic writer His views on war influenced all the great leaders of the last  years and I would wager that it would be the last  years but I couldnt prove it
A classic of strategy for approaching difficult decisions Also helps explain some parts of Chinese thinking of strategy
I read this over the weekend and I found it very though provoking Several of the laws made me think about current affairs Perhaps our leaders should read it
but this is not to say it is void of content It seems to me to have been written in such a way as to avoid any irrelevant information Without quoting or divulging its secrets
The Art of War is a unique tool for looking into the strategic mind of the past
Mostly common sense but still worth the read
Read for the th time Sun Tzus Art of War is one of those worlds finest classic literatures that marks and influences those who will challenge themselves to read this military treatise It discusses tactics and strategies in military affairs
that are implicitly related and indirectly applied to the fields of business affairs
ancient history
therefore we grow wiser with them Understanding Sun Tzus treatise is understanding ancient methods of resolving conflicts
and victory are contained in the pages of this book  While translated to modern language
the essence is clear that the Art of War is an old profession
Dont waste your time buying this you wont find much thats relevant for today  Even if you are a military person
A must read for anyone interested in warfare and how it is waged  How battles are won and lost  Highlights the importance of intelligence  What Sunzi wrote so long ago holds true for todays warriors
the manual for defeating your enemy yet securing your place at Gods feet as the meek who will inherit the earth Defeating your enemy before the battle ensues
and is so much applicable today as it was  years ago when it was written  i might be off by a year or 
not the actual book Has a good summary of your trying to write a paper Maybe I didnt read the discription correctly
Tons of important typos and poor translations
I got this in great condition I enjoyed reading this and learning about how significant this writing has been in ancient times and in modern times I had this delivered in a timely manner too
I was wondering what the BIG DEAL of this book was Many business people have read it and address it as a business book I found it free on amazon and of course
and the design of the book and format was appealing However
there were some translation issues which were mildly excusable and expected
and the few flaws this version has are excusable for the cheap price of 
I loved the writing style of the book It was short
Theres like s of editions of the Art of War  Its difficult to figure out which ones are legit  My particular edition yellow book with red and black yin yang was one of the fakes
Iwas a little disappointed when I opened this book This is not one of the better published translations that are available
The product description is misleading as it doesnt mention that this isnt the ACTUAL book This version does not contain full text Look elsewhere if you want to purchase The Art of War It was my mistake for not being more wary of the low price and not looking into the page count
grammatical errors and difficult layout  abound in the kindle edition  Very distracting
This is a classic book that I heard about and wanted to read  Its a very interesting book with interesting principles and strategies
The book is short but interesting Its written in the style of bullet points Its not hugely practical for todays times
but it is very interesting to see the wisdom of someone from 
There is so much interesting information in this small book
and it is such a good guide to strategy The strategies can be extrapolated to help in problemsolving
of course It is a great thoughtprovoking text for dealing with difficult situations and finding outofthebox solutions It encourages creative solutions
that want a new understanding of the world and how people fit within it
I was prepared for something much better  His writing might impress someone with no experience in the field
but for those who have a general knowledge of the outdoors and warfare
it is not very enlightening What makes it particularly disappointing to me is the fact that he contradicts himself so many times  It would seem that the whole idea is to impress people with his wisdom rather than actually impart anything of any real value There is some good advice
but nothing that is much above the common sense of an American Eagle Scout and most of the successes are simply the result of deception and ruthlessness Something that is repeated several times is the fact that trying to fight a war in faraway places can be very expensive and difficult  Considering the fiascoes of Korea and Vietnam
we should already know this by bitter experience  So other than a few examples of deception and trickery
I dont feel the book was worth the small price I paid for it
A concise book filled with timeless insight regarding both war and life
This book is one that you read over and over  Always some new comes to light as you reread  Should be on a need to read list at college level and a must for all military people
but to mean american they didnt quite click Buy it if you would like to see different view points of a collectivist culture
Great price and a perfect stocking stuffer
This version is cheap for a reason More like a summary of the original
but not at all what I was looking for Maybe it is good as a summary but as the whole thing and a beautiful edition to a collection
price attractive but no translator specified
You will be surprised how much pure horse crap youll begin seeing in people once youve read this book Essential tool for life especially in the workplace
nice simplified version of The Art of War if thats what youre looking for
Just my curious about china
This is a low quality
EXTREMELY abridged version with so few pages I probably could have written it myself in  hours Youd think if theyre advertising a wellknown book but selling a version with only  of the content that theyd at least make an ATTEMPT at mentioning that
Deceptice sales tactics Do not buy this This is barley a cliff note version of a long and profound book Very disappointed I DO NOT RECOMMEND
this book is a condensed version of the original book I am highly disappointed and will be returning immediately
where upon I will purchase the original version
Very handy book when neededperfect condition
Already a classic hit for this ancient war strategy book that still benefit this generation
Adians voice was perfect narrative to explain and follow the cunning nation of war
while getting deeply educated about this ancient strategy Highly highly recommended for anyone who is GOT fan to get a copy A Must have
Thank you so much love it awsome condition
Always my favourite interpretation of Sun Tzus Art of War Most interpretation I have read are dry and dull to read James Clavel captures the spirit and intent of Sun Tzus masterpiece of strategy
I can not speak intelligently about the quality of this translation  Given the accuracy of translation  I found that this was a brilliant summary of tactics used in ground warfare in China several thousand years ago  Still poignant today across battlefields  It does not of course include analysis of naval and air and ground technological advances  Excellent reading and it comes highly recommended
A classic that relates as much to business
planning as to its original subject of war
 Review of the unabridged and unannotated Cleary translation pp Likely revolutionary when it was first written
the wisdom contained in this book is now old hat common sense The parts directly applicable to war
with few exceptions such as know thy enemy and know thyself and fear no defeat are exclusively applicable to st generation warfare
though a few pages give a prcis of what should be expected of an officer corps and disciplined army which are applicable to any multitier centralized organization The rest of the book is taken up with descriptions of terrain types
etc with no modern practical nor metaphorical application that I could discern I wonder how many generals got their men slaughtered because they read this book and thought they understood war Likely more than the mandarin system advanced to high government post on stylized understanding of the five classics and their commentaries Of the muchpraised business strategy or general strategy or the art of war as life
every tycoon wannabe read this book as a text for making money  That isnt why Sun Zi wrote it  He wrote it as a primary text for wannabe generals and military tacticians  I suspect Erwin Rommel read it
it is a very great look at military tactics
One of my favorite books
or anyone looking to learn the strategy of defeating an opponent You should read this if you havent This book is so important to the history of the world
but is intended to help one gain an understanding of tactics and battle strategy This english translation is very detailed and when displayed on Kindle unknown words are defined and easily understood Also
the uninterpretated version is a little more intresting and fun to read
This is not the full version of the book bit instead a cliff note or quick version great for someone that needs a fast read for a paper or assignment but not for those that want to read the actual book
but overall wouldnt recommend It seems like a lot of the information was outdated because the book references chariots and older methods of warfare I would suggest thinking about the concepts in terms of modern warfare
This is not the actual book but rather a version of the book broken down I was looking for the original and this is not it
description is misleading It works if you want a summary
Interesting tips for war The old language was a little boring
may be because English is not my native language
Versus the Art of Peace Good advice that is useful when enacting revenge upon others
Dont let the title deceive you This book is not only for warfare on the battlefield but in your life In some ways a fighting mans Tao Te Ching Sunzus classic prepares you for dealing with the cruel and duplicitous I have read the book in Chinese and English and can confirm this is an excellent translation Its funny how business people use the book when really they are just exercising their greed The book is not about stealing but about gaining an advantage but always for the purpose of good and benefit of all Over and over Sunzi discusses how the leader must consider their subordinates to achieve success The story will remain useful throughout time
All members of the military and politicalwar theorists need to read this Its a classic that introduces timeless concepts for how to wage war Its up there with Carl von Clausewitzs On War in the annals of military theory writing
Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese philosopher most of his sayings are still relevant to this day and age regarding business and warfare I wish I can find my copy but it got lost in the midst of my stuff and probably thrown away since the book is very small I might buy a second copy when I move out within two months so I can read it 
Though it may be the quintessential book for the military student and solider its relevance can not be ignored This book was written so long ago and in a language so difficult to translate its almost impossible to fully understand That being said this version is very well done The translations are done without embellishment with the commentary following each chapter The basic principals of displine
Way ahead of its time Tactics have changed but the psychology of warfare is still the same Must read for  the military
this edition is shoddily copyedited There are lots of typographical errors You can read it for content but Im a stickler for books using proper spellings so if I were to purchase again
Id look for a cleaner edition
and I realized that this is a shortened version of the actual book
so theres no comment on it you should read other great reviews But the edition is terrible It even has the chapters in the wrong order I mean
Has some really good advice that is generally limited to warcombat but not much else  As a combat veteran I found it interesting
especially after having to work under senior officers for four years as a USAF pilot Most couldnt find their butt with four hands
but too basic if you have experience in military combat  Very short book
you can finish it in a couple of hours  A lot of stuff in this book is great for boxers to read  More useful for training boxers than for modern military combat  However
but the content is simple without much development The basic ideas are clear
and every thing in between Written in a way that can be understand but takes a higher mind to really allow it to sink in If you have an afternoon go through it and take it in
youll look at the world in a different light and maybe you might even realize that you know a lot of this already but be open minded and take in everything it says  because The Art of War is something else I highly recommend it
the kind of knowledge that is timeless and a lifelong benefit to have learned  If you havent read this book and learned its teachings then you should and if you have read this book but not learned any life lessons then you need to go back and read it again until you grasp the knowledge you are holding in your hands
Very important literature for these times  The true nature of mans Warfare
there is more to this book than meets the eye This book also holds strategy one can use with interpersonal conflicts
What can I say Classic read This has been used by corporate employees and managers to get a leg up on the competition through strategies of contention
empowerment and going for the kill Recommend if you just want to learn battle strategies and applying their context into real world scenarios
A large portion of the book is outdated That being said there are tidbits of timeless information related to watergate
it is a little difficult to grasp the ideas and apply it to todays world without rereading the book multiple times
Stewie Griffin was my inspiration to read this when I saw it was free for the kindle  I have no knowledge of how good the translation is
and not too long  The commentary was interesting as well perhaps a bit sparse
Learn from this book There is much wisdom inside This quick read is about mobilizing troops effectively
Good reading Made me think of being out there on a march way back in the days of hand weapons Some good things apply to modern times One I notice is when the men are dissatisfied they go and whisper together in small groups Probably plenty more Probably read it again Goes along with Journey to the West in that way
good subject matter This book contains a collection of war proverbs There is no explaining of the proverbs
it is rather more like a list of proverbs by which a general should carry out the act of war What struck me most was the admonition to disregard the orders of your superior should the information available to you contradict that which has been handed down This understanding of personal autonomy is
the most important lesson given
The quality and feel of the binding is excellent
Thanks to this baby I have everything I need to wage war on my opponents in the corporate jungle That part about working around insurance rate changes
yet easy read  Its easy to follow along with and the concepts in the book makes sense  Apply this to modern day life and you can begin to build a strong mentality
I had to read this because my students talked about it constantly They believed that in the pages of the Art Of War were magic words to control and manipulate others This book is very popular among the incarcerated  The main difficulty they seen to have is the references to historical figures I found the book interesting mainly because I love reading about history Although i dont believe in book banning The art Of war along with a few other manipulation type books I personally feel should not be allowed in any jail or prison setting
and would likely require more study for one to be successful in this field
great for military history buffs as well as people looking for a little advice on how to take control of your life and strategically plan the life ahead of you I recommend this to many people and have personally given many copies as gifts
These observations of human nature and the ways to accomplish your military aims are simple
interesting and true Human nature remains the same Amazingly
this advice is completely applicable to everyday life
Could use a little help with the translationsome simple little English mistakes in this version

One of best books ever written for strategy construction
Sun Tzuhe was just the best at writing the best strategy down   Take my Word pleasethis is always a good purchase
Sun Tzu knew what he wrote about The language may seem stilted
but the principles are clear Some thing never change The Easton edition is a superior translation and an elegant presentation  I recommend it highly
Plan on reading it twice at the least  There is allot in the text that needs to be mentally squeezed out
Very interesting book that was very easy to read Would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning ways to improve your life
I needed this for my son who has it as a set text in a Civics class Its a perfectly decently made book at a price which makes it cheaper than printing out sections at home from public domain sources
I thought I was buying the actual book  this is like a cliff notes version that I think I actually like better What it does is basically summarize main topics and breaks them down into a few quotes from the actual book that convey the meaning I was actually using this book to help my poker game and it worked
This is a short but detailed book Pay attention and invite it into your life
This book is on the Must Read of all Military Colleges  And that is through out the world  It has been printed in every language known to man  It is simple  It is direct  It is how to win a war  It may be a thousand years old
The Art of War takes the battle plans and uses psychological principles to win against any enemy Written in simple
descriptive language that anyone can read and apply to whatever adversarial situation presents itself It can even be interpreted as a relationship guide The Art of War also states ways of fighting without having to fight at all Brilliant and as relatable as it was when it was originally written Everyone should have this book on their nightstandnext to their Bible
career and make you a more complete person in general I recommend this book to be read by all those I care about becoming a better person
particularly if one is in a position of authority over many persons and or required to intelligently utilize scarce resources A fun book
Ive heard how this is a good book to read for examples of running a business There are good points that can be extrapolated but you definitely need to read between the lines and look for the true meaning
This was the fourth time I read The Art of War I really love the book and strongly recommend it to anyone Its truly one of the most timeless books there is and you can apply these principles whether youre a student
this edition is quite poor as theres a ton of mistakes
wrong translations
The book was in good condition It was ordered as a replacement for one I loaned out and never got back
or great piece for any collector
Well one cannot properly review at work this venerable
its worth noting that Sun Tzus conceptions of nature
Sun Tzu is a genius and this book is a timeless classic  When faced with a problem
make sure your on the right side  Then plan all your moves and take into account all possible outcomes  Make sure your plan is foolproof then use your greatest strength against your problems weakest or key root issue  Read the book for yourself and you will find that the book can be applied to a variety of situations from problem solving
no matter how you feel about war The book was good quality and I had no complaints about it
and I continue to find new bits of wisdom and perspective every time I read it This book has helped guide my leadership decisions and has given confidence to my conflict resolution abilities I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about leadership wisdom
cheap version of the book
which should be a required reading I loved it and Im sure you will too as it is written in bullet form since the statements are slightly complex and have deeper meaning
Great Read valuable information and lessons applied to all aspects of life
its timeless because of its truth
Not impressed thought I was buying a book that would last me more than a day of reading It is more of a really condense version of a classic Guess I will buy the original from a real book store
This is a very poor excuse for a book Theres  completely blank pages at the end Its like they translated the original art of war through google translate
Havent read it yet But fiancee says it is a good read and explores the mind of the author
and thats all this book is made up of Its a light read and is nice to pick up for a page or two when cooking or something
but most of it is actual strategy useful during the Dynasty wars There are a few concepts from it that I am implementing in my own life though and would recommend anyone to read it as it is short and does contain some wisdom
Nice to read even all these years after the first time I read it in high school  Makes for great listening too on long trips
I give this App a  Star because what it tells is still relevent in todays modern warfare And the price cant be beat itd free Id recommend this to all military personnel as a must read And to all civilians who are interested in the Art of War Id highly recommend this AppBook
Got to be in a certain frame of mind for this one  Might be empowering to someone fighting a battle in this world  For the rest of us its either a yawn or disturbing  Probably wont hurt you to read it but there is probably something else out there more empowering
Great knowledge for myself  an amaising book great insight  certainly a book for the ages  and for leaders of all  walks of life
This ancient text is as useful today as it was in ancient history
Overrated  Too many people try to quote from this book without actually reading it Historically it shows an interesting perspective on conquering forces
but there are better sources to get more complete information
translation notes or any other content Not even an Index  Numerous mispelling and even missing text  Page titles at top are both the name of the book instead of chapter Very useful Sarcasm I bought  copies in order to give my friends I will be giving these to Goodwill and buying a different version
This is a short version of the book Disappointed because it didnt give any indication that this was a short version of the book in the descriptions The worse part is I didnt read the reviews until now and other people had the same issues
It is an attractive little volume but the content is very limited Guess Ill look at the full edition
This seems kind of like a cliff notes version of the full book Maybe Im wrong as I didnt read this one It was a gift It has larger print and is thinner than my copy however Regardless this is a great price for a book that has many applications in life regarding strategy
Most popular book for those with careers in the military Everyone should read this short book
and i would suggest watching a movie that will show u some great strategies from the times it was written Like Red Cliff
The general anything period that is chinese or korean So much fun
Great read packed with a great strategy in life advise
There is a reason this book is a wellknown classic I found The Art of War to be insightful and useful for everyday situations as well as in reference to war It is more about philosophy than actual combat
Shortdumbed down version of the real book Do not waste your time and purchase then
better luck at a half price books Very disappointed with seller not putting this in summary
good product
This product was extremely disappointing I paid a high price for a very standard book which was supposed to be a special addition I was hoping the cover would have been made out of a high quality material instead this book was a standard quality book at a very high price
while some it is changed by the logistics of our modern flightbased world of today
the gist of it right to the point is that every time we ignored the most basic advice in this book
we lost or backed out of a war that we failed to understand why the other side fought so hard for
where North Vietnams General Giap and the Vietcong used a very successful Go strategy while we lost the war by not understanding the strategy of the enemy
This book though dry every now and then is very knowledgeable about warfare This book is also great because even though its about warfare has so many other applications outside of warfare
Very nice paper
and nice spacing of text Very easy to read The actual content makes perfect sense and is easy to remember
Ill definitely make this book a yearly read I havent highlighted so much material in awhile And will be putting some of these tactics into everyday living
This material must be repeatedly read in order to absorb its full impact  Premises of The Art of War were violated over and over by the Bush administration and our Army  I once understood that our military schools of war at one time studied this material Now
 I will complete my plans for world domination soon  Allegedly the us armed forces still read this short book to give thought on the truth of how real war works  Was also an entertaining read
the art of war is a guide where the best war strategies are explained concise
The manner in which the translations and explanations jump back and forth tends to be confusing I found myself flipping back and forth a lot Otherwise
The absolute best military strategy guide ever writtenevery soldier should read it
Do not let the title fool you This is not so much about war as it is about relationships and leadership I am a  year old house wife and mother  I am also a writer and constantly searching for insights and inspirations  I inherited this copy of the book from my son when he left for college  Read a page or two a day sometimes a paragraph will do  The words are thousands of years old but the wisdom is timeless
some things dont change with time the art of war discusses how to keep the big picture in focus
but the points are relevant for anyone doing business
but Sun Tzu is the master of turning simple psychology into art 
it is amazing how his words have stood the test of time
not a thriller but interesting and a quick read Most will lose interest on the first page
but still contain useful information
As described and shipping was fast Happy with my order
Great read The one problem I have is that the commentary can get REALLY annoying Gets in  the way of the main text I know the only way to do away with it is to read it in the original Chinese
interesting read Every politician and business and military leader should give this work consideration If I could
The full length book is great This however is someones cliff notes of the book And its not even a good summary This is not the full length book
Great product fast shipping
Do not buy this Its not the actual book  Theyll take your money immediately and youll never see it again
I felt no real delight I suppose young military leaders would enjoy this
The Art of War was interesting when you think about how old this book is and see the different tactics discussed in it  I have heard many times too
that this is a good read for people in the business world today  I agree with that in part  There are parts of the book that are translatable to the business world but a lot that are not Overall it is a very short book  Im glad I finally read it
its only one hundred seventy largefont pages  What saves this book is the very good introduction
A classic truly a must have but this format sucks book is too thin and too wide for my taste
One of the best books I ever readbut it took me a few times to fully understand what Sun Tzu was saying The philosophies in this book can be applied to most anything
even compared to cliff notes  If you want a very simple gist of real book
Awsome book If you like learning about ancient civilization army rules and leadership this is definitely the book for you Dont forget this is and asian book which was translated to English The version is ok and the translation is awsome as well
non fancy version hoping to get into the material
a little on the small side a good light read but has all the good info
This book is packed with great information for life on and off the battlefield So many of its principles apply to sports and the business world Students if you need to write a paper on some military event in history
this book should be your starting point Use it to back up your main points or thesis and youll win the day
This give a stylized and sparse outline of some possible principles of was as it pertains to feudal times Very little applies to todays types of conflicts and provides little to no true advice about conflict resolution
I think this is one of the must read books everyone should read once in their lifetime  Not only does it give a good outlook on miltary tactics it tells you the logic behind them which you can apply to other situations or intances in life
Strategically wonderful  It helps you to uderstand the actual art of planning and executing any type of war think of it from all of its aspects  I encourage you to purchase this book
it is well worth its price
This was a good book,it was just more dry of a story than what I usually like to read I recommend this if you are more into the Buddhist culture,as it is centered on pretty much killing your enemies with kindness
Great job providing The Art of War affordably  Quality of printing is ok
I was very disappointed to learn that this was an outline of the book when I got it yesterday I was really looking forward to reading an actual book
there were way too many editing errors  I was expecting a wellthoughtout and organized expose on how to carry out a successful warsomething on the order of Machiavellis very astute and very clear way to obtain and retain power as set out in The Prince  No comparison
which is from the late th century
intermixes the text and the commentary  In a way thats good because its easier to associate the text to the commentary
but sometimes the commentary isnt all that good or insightful
The Art of War is famous throughout the world for good reason and is required reading by many business schools
This is a wellrespected and inexpensive book written more than two thousand years ago It can teach you many things
has some valuable information that can be applied to life
This is a classic text that I have never read before  It is so interesting to see the perspective that it offers and the applications and relevance that it has today  A book that is remarkable in its simplicity and expression of common sense  It makes me wonder how and where weve lost our way
present and futureBook was,is and will be as well as can be translated and acted in life in many ways not just war
I had been aware of this book for many years but always bypassed it  A mentor recently recommended it as an important resource for a different perspective on the business world  I found that this small volume spurred a lot of ideas for me  A great place to learn some tools for negotiation
but the actal writing of the book jumps quickly from one idea to the next
no to say the idea of such trait is not unlike a general commanding his army
or a idea or psyical thing Specializing in a singular idea
the facts on how to control and be victorious in a battle of metal or mind
I bought this for the kindle app It was free  I had read it once before in paperback form and loved it  It seems to be better than I remember it from  years before I think this should be required reading for everyone
The art of war is a great book Good for strategic planning
It was alright I mean its a classic so I had to read it but I totally think that are better books you can read about business or war the good thing is that is a very short read so you can finish it in less than a day like I did
The classic breakdown of how to gain and leverage an advantage Sun Tzu was mostly writing about military strategy but his principles can be applied to almost anything in these modern times Very interesting
Ancient Wisdom when dealing with battle and military might I guess I was expecting the wisdom to translate over into everyday life in the modern  corporate or civilian world It didnt  However after studying this book I have learned that strategy and taking your enemy into account in all its variables weakness and strengths is to have higher ground when accessing your attack plans Basically know your enemy inside and out then let them fall prey to your plans  I am glad this was a short book because it took a lot of strain to decipher this stuff It wasnt a fun read at all but I am glad that now I can say that I read it  Definitely a read for those with an acquired taste Otherwise a more compatible self empowerment book may be more useful
Not what I expected Did not like the format AT ALL Waste of money
great deal
Lots of great insight with this one
Bought this mainly as a required reading for myself  Theres plenty of books out there that parody this philosophy  Mainly I bought it as a reference  People may think your weird though if quote it all the time around the water cooler
Dont buy this its cheap and the translation is so bad You wont understand the meaning
This book was drab in some parts and interesting in others Some of the commentary was too extensive for the average reader I love how the lessons of Sunni are still relevant in modern warfare
I am retired military  years and have used this book throughout my career Now that I am retired and working in the civilian sector
Ive been meaning to read The Art of War for several years now Grabbed this translation because it was free The translator does a good job of comparing various other translations of the book and noting where they differ and what he thinks is the most likelyaccurate translation of a particular passage
I get the main characters point Great book and very informative Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer Characters and other plot
Very good insight despite being a centuries old document I wouldve given it five stars but the illustrated aspect if the book was poor on the paper white kindle
this is one of the very best books to read
Condensed version It took ten minutes to read the whole book The full version is better
interesting and helpful Great information and perspective on how to use your mind and resources to conquer all of your goals
This paperback edition was in new shape
and easy to understand Highly recommend this book for anyone studying the subject of strategy in relation to competitive business or in general
Very short reads less than  minutes but good information
It is a great reference
very good quality paper and binding Would definitely recommend this book
this is a nice Kindle edition  Im a stickler for formatting
the text is fairly accurate
This is the best Kindle version I could find among other badly formatted
One of the first kindle books purchased I enjoyed the simplicity of reading The structure of the book and the information made for excellent reading This book should be read by business people and leaders
A friend recommended that I read The Art of War by Sun Tzu and I had to look every where just to find an edition containing the words of Sun Tzu Other reworks were filled with so much commentary that it was difficult to actually understand what Sun Tzu was saying This copy gives of the work is clear and easy to read
it is extremely enticing and even though it was written more than  hundred years ago
it is probably more relevant now than ever before The introduction written by Steven Schrang is also enticing and gives great insight into who Sun Tzu was Great Read
movement of troops and completion of battle in various locations and climates  An excellent work
I have read a few versions of The Art of War This is my favorite version I will have to read it a few more times before I will be self satisfied by the teachings
or to teaching Overall an interesting read
Just horrible I couldve printed a nicer copy at home About  pages long and felt like a high school students summary of Sun Tzus philosophy
This is the highly abridged version Still some neat info
An excellent book as everyone knows of course A recommended read for all persons A true timeless classic A must read for any young adult or aspiring leader of menwomen
A classic of classics  The man who best understood war has taught generations how prepare and prevent it  Worthy of deep study and application in all aspects of life
Very misleading This isnt a real version of the book Its just a summary
Hubbarts letter is incredible and full of good sense The Art of the war
I think this is the cliff notes to the actual book
I have heard this book referenced in popular culture for years as something that provided lessons in war that were applicable to conflict and contained good strategy advise across the spectrum  I have to say
light and perfect for travel Not ideal as a gift  It is flimsy if you want a nice copy
Classic  be advised which version you buy This was a lot smaller than I expected Thats on me tho ya digg I recommend the shambhala dragon edition translated and edited by Thomas cleary Its got indepth breakdowns of the material that pull from multiple perspectives
This is the BEST book on strategy that has ever been written This book is timeless I have seen strategies from this book utilized in business and politics It does not take long to read
pages in mine were detached and some were cut unevenly even though its brand new
The Art of War is a timeless masterpiece of interaction of power and politics It is about war and not war This version is the one you want if you are interested in the simple
yet profound wisdom of Sun Tzu I have tried several other versions edited and commented on
Simple Literally Does provide good strategies
A great classic warfare book written by a man ahead of his time Very good read Book came in paperback and is skinnysmall
but looks well and is a highly recommended read for the price
Highly recommend reading this book  The philosophies behind the logic are practical enough for everyday use for example
I would recommend this book to anyone in the military or in leadership It gives great insight into strategic thinking
the greats never become out dated  the lessons in this book can be applied to most aspects of life have wanted to read this for years getting it on amazon finally made it possible
Great literary classic Good quality for a trade paperback Very fairly priced  Nice glossy cover
Since this great book now fits inside my phone it is not a bad app for the price I definitely do not regret my purchase and think almost everyone who gets this will feel the same way
If you need tips on handling situations in every day life you will enjoy this book People of all ages can get great advice from this read try it today
This version was straight to the point and not too long Not sure if other versions were longer Reads like an army commanders tips and tricks manual to running an army
This book is a classic and should be read by anyone looking to get ahead in life IT does not have to be about war as much as common sense about thinking ahead Good read
wise man said some basic wisdom lines about life and struggle of life human nature hasnt changed much so it is true even nowdays a splendid prospective for any strategy student today
The original Chinese might not have been perfect but the English translator could have done a better job elucidating on some of the passages  Many are just plain sloppy
The simplicity and straightforwardness of this book is why it had survived for so many years These truths in ancient warfare still hold true today Know your enemy Know when to attack to ensure victory These simple will get you far in life
I had to read this for a class and what I took away from it was the lessons have meaning in modern times and will be a source of knowledge for years to come
This is a nice presentation of an otherwise difficult read  The book is well presented and of course a must read for business professionals  just so you can hold your own when someone sitting across the table from Harvard Business School starts quoting it  Perhaps overthought Im sure their are better tools for getting its point across theres nothing like the original
Provides with logic and philosophy applicable to everyday life and business
great brain exercise Helps if you can use your imagination to apply it to your life
and simply not controlling my army effectively After purchasing
my victory rate has increased significantly
and I am a much more trained war general Very good daytoday read for prospective buyers who control armies
I bought this as I read another review which mentions this book as a better alternative Was not as thrilled as I thought I would be I have other books on the Art of War that are far more explanation and practical use driven than this one  The principles are easy but sometimes it was the commentaries from other military science leaders that convoluted the meanings and put their spin on Tzus philosophy While this is good for some
An excellent price for a classic book  Delivered promptly
I found the book most interesting in that the supposedly reallife author
the translations that survived are incomplete Chapters appear to be missing entire sections
and no annotations present in many other versions
its hard to make any sense of this vague and metaphorical ancient text I would advise against buying this version if you want a thorough understanding of this seminal work
All warfare is based on deception Quotes are applicable in all walks of life
It arrived with other items in a big box but the item was in perfect condition
Classic book about ancient military strategy  Many applications to military leadership but also to the business world  Take time to read this classic
all i need is my personal opinion of this product still need more words  this form is why more products are not reviewed
Great book that you can apply to your everyday life I highly recommend people read this at least twice That way you can get a better understanding of it
good read explains warfare up to today this is great know how for a lot of things in life not just warfare pick this book up if you even have half a brain
A if you want a basic translation For the price it was worth it
what time you need to kill a small amount of years and I have no choice but to be fair years and the green bay packers are not too much youre to the yard and got it from a bit late to
This is a great book  The art of war teaches us not to fight a war if its not a surewin  The philosophy behinds this is to reserve the scarce resources and human lives
diplomacy and negotiation are preferred  The original The Art of War in Chinese was written in th century BC
This is the best edition for easy understanding  Principles are still relevant in todays world  I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to read the Art of War
Outstanding book as accurate today as it was s of years ago
book in very good condition just like represented  thanks
this is a timeless book on successfully fighting and strategically planning battles
This piece has survived through the ages as a testament to the persistence of human spirit While long and challenging,,this book will enlighten you greatly Enjoy 
in great condition and quite quickly
Kind of a cut down version but still a good read I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesnt have a lot of time to read
The book is probably not as smoothly produced  edited as other versions of The Art of War  Compare the presentation of a couple of versions before settling on the one that suits you best
The concepts that are described in the writings of Sun Tzu work equally well in warfare and in business
I found large chunks of the book were missing in this format  At the time I bought this
It is written as a war tactic manual by a couple thousand year old Chinese dude Insert sarcasm after this point
Basically a quick summary gets to the point
it is rather written as hyperbole and generalities of situations not a detailed explanation of each battle situation  I really emphasizes deceit and distraction rather than actually just racing to battle  Preparation and patience are also much of the emphasis  It OK
Nice quality for a paperback  Glossy cover and easy read font size
Contradictory instructions for how to win a military campaign  Just about anything you do could be wrong or right  Translation could have been much better  If you are a military freak
Item as describedGreat price and great service
This book had tons of useful knowledge that I personally feel could be used in everyday life How you tackle your problems headon to how to avoid certain problems altogether Great buy to better enrich your life as well as your thinking
It is good quality but i think some stuff is missing from the original Also needs to be spell checked I found some grammatical errors
A interesting description of the oriental mind and how it crafted the outcome of various wars A primer for military students
Was pleasantly surprised when we got the book It got here  days ahead if schedule and was new  Bought it as used if it is used who ever owned it never broke the spine
Perhaps I have been spoiled by the James Clavell writing of this classic but I was less than impressed with this version it just didnt seem to have the feel I expected
It was in good condition and the shopping cost was reasonable The book itself was great Although it was a coffee table version
I love these classic books They are timeless and never get old Anyone can relate to the characters
classic book it iss a quick easy read and extremely insightful even with its age
An excellent book on strategic planning that can be applied to your daily life in work or dealing with people
This is an excellent edition and translation of this classic The forwards essay is essential to contextualize The Art of War and its philosophical context
If you want to study Sun Tzus philosophy this is not the book to order  The worst translation Ive ever seen
I should have checked but I was really disappointed that the book was so incredibly thin For the price
Solid advice that lasts throughout the centuries  unfortunately this advice comes from a monster of barbaric proportions
A very good version of the manuscript Sincerely
Great book I recommend it for anyone who likes to learn about the real world
The First Thus edition from Filiquarian publishing is a terrible translation I suspect they used Google Translate with a bit of help from a human They dont even list the translator As another reviewer pointed out
it reads like those terrible instructions you get in cheap Chinese products This book as with many historical books is difficult to shop for on Amazon Im headed to my local BN to flip through different translations
but i also like  laws of power better
Great vision of an ancient warrior While a number of his thoughts are common sense he has had the forsight to put them all into practice which has made him Chinas greatest General reat read
Great book to live life by You can read a page  a day and apply it to your personal and professional  life  situations
An excellent book that has application to the business world
Amazing book with great insight Thankful that I read it
Four stars due to the translation which was a little sloppy Otherwise
so I was somewhat disappointed Not that its a bad book I just expected something different Keep an open mind
   not like the book The CD left out too much information Too expensive for one CD
Great book No wonder its among the books that all managers have to read Absolutely recommended to anyone who wants to learn to rule their life
This is a work that changes each time you read it The text doesnt necessarily change
Just as applicable today if not more so as when it was written  years ago  Some great quotes throughout
I was hoping for something that was more readable and understandable I thought that this book provided strategies in short form but it does not
its cheap because it is some sort of reduced size reprint Guess it is nice to carry around as it is small
It is a really good translation
It came quickly No shipping with prime  The product was described correctly I would buy again A must read Useful for a lot of things in life
A must have for any book shelf Nice short timeless quips of knowledge
The art of war the best strategist book
A must read very political leader and military personnel and anyone interested in the logic of battle
This was the real deal unlike some other for sale on Amazon It makes a great gift for any history buff or any manly man
A very old book its content is taught in all our military war colleges
I first read this classic text in hard copy and purchased this kindle version to have as a ready reference  I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the editing and formatting of this kindle edition  This version contains no chapter stops and has numerous flaws including but not limited to inconsistent indentations
Incomplete paragraph breaks and the use of  instead of proper horizontal line breaks The text itself is little changed from the translation made a hundred year ago as I believe it should be  My negative rating on this book is restricted to the poor presentation on kindle and if it is fixed and uploaded to my kindle I would be happy to change my rating
smart man great wisdom for any country or marriage
Good read but needed to ask questions to get an understanding about his principalsStill growing lol
its been used in business for decades as the source for smart business leadership
Just buy it  Its that insightful and you can quickly apply its logical to just about any situation in your life
This is not the full book Its only excerpts  thats not what I was looking for For the price I expected the full book,
I like the way its laid out and seems like a very good reproduction of a classic text
Very informative and enlightening methods of war for that time in history
I found this book to be full of good advice that you can incorporate into your everyday life within reason
just dated a little and probable should only be used as a primer or beginning step The world may have changed a bit since this was written
interesting  Not a lot of depth  But clear wisdom gathered by mistakes
The real deal  Tons of good information to help you better understand what it takes to actually keep a fighting army in the field
I was expecting this to be much longer This is a series of excerpts If youre looking for a more detailed translation of the full book go for the one by Ralph D Sawyer
Very interesting for someone with military experience
classic book on strategy Everyone should have a read of this at least once
This is a classic and must read for high energy business people
One of the best books ever written
This is a very good read I can recommend this to anyone that would like to gain the insights of Sunzi
this is my favorite translation of the art of war
Standard reading in war colleges and always worth referring back to for understanding of warfare
or on the actual battlefield A great book showcasing how to be victorious
What is best way to learn How about from the master if its good enough for officers in the military good enough for me
This is not the actually book its just notes be aware
The information is awesome  The writing is stiff and requires focus and determination to read  A war bible for every walk of life
too much history and too many forgettable names I was more interested in the meat of the philosophy of Sun Tzu
when there are excellent alternatives  Received in good condition
A good read even if your not in business
This is not what I actually wanted and it is a bit childish but gets the point across Learn to be the enemy
it goes much further A real teaching on thinking Timeless A must
This is an absolute classic that any business man or woman should read
This book has lots of practical advice for any who have an ear to hear it  It is relatively short
Thank you so much for the timely delivery Thank you so much for the great service and great product A
if youre going to buy it no comment or review is going to stop you  Enjoy the book
great book and its great on the kindle  i love how the kindle makes the books so interactive  i definitely recommend the book
Awesome feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too cant go wrong get this doit just do it
The format is NOT the best Content is OK Id not buy it from Amazon again
great for business too
it is a summary A bad one Not worth the money
Essential reading for those interested in military tactics It reminded me again how tied we are to ancient ideas
and the ebbok format is very convenient
Cheap and arrived in a timely fashion The product is great and works well
Bit disappointing compared to the quality of the ones I saw at BN and Costco after the purchase
This book allows me to see things differently when it comes to handling small to big scale conflict
This is a satisfactory book but the translation could be more precisely done in English The book is good enough for general information but I felt a little more background would have been of help
I originally purchased multiple copies of this translation as a goingaway present for a couple of coworkers
and I was so impressed with the quality of the translation and the simple
unembroidered way that it was presented that I am going to order an additional copy for myself within the next week
Great read and relevant to todays world Excellent Kindle version making all of this work readily accessible  Thumbs up
Very wise tactical methods which stand the test of time
Nothing special here Just a good bound version of an already classic work For the price
this book is for everyone that wants to learn the art of strategy and organization Although written for war the book can be easily used in everyday business situations The only drawback with the book is it was written in Chinese so translation can sometimes seem a little confusing Some parts I had to reread twice in order to understand what was being said
but by the time it is completed it felt more like is was giving life lessons as well I thought it odd and inspiring in a way that the author could merge these thoughts rather the solely concentrate on how to kill your enemy Ill be reading it again
sweet and to the point  Very useful in business  I love the audio book and the written book  I would buy it again
Bought for my  year old son,he had to read it for school and he loved it He said it was the best book
criminal justice or even understand terrorism The Art of War was mentioned numerous times in my understanding terrorism course and is very helpful to understand techniques that guerrilla and terrorist groups have used from the book
An alltime classic on strategy  I found the new content to be somewhat esoteric and just skipped all the parts in the brackets
One of the greatest books I have ever read on strategy and tactics I really like it
Only  pages long Not the real book
not the real book just an over priced cliff notes bur it did arrive quickly
This is the bible on warfare and it is timeless Small but great book Im very glad its still available
Very nice read applicable to setting strategy and tactics whether in war
I have to agree with the review that I read before I purchased the book The author really does not know when to shut up  The Art of War and other works from Asia allow me to recommend Go Rin No Sho by Miyamoto Musashi really benefit from some perspective and discussion from the translator  I get that This guy has to interject his thoughts right in the middle of the source work Often his thoughts are many times longer than the text that is the focus of his ramblings But dont be dissuaded from taking on this master piece because of this
 go ahead and enjoy what our author has to share His perspective is not bad
good reading for the mind
This very condensed version of Sun Tzus The Art of War would be better as a pocket version for quick reference
I am kind of torn on how many stars to give this as the product itself the audio book is great
but the actual content is retarded Sun Tzu spouts off a bunch of useless crap like If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy
One of the greatest books of all time
How to win your battles well earned and spy on the enemy and is great for tactics of ying and yang
Do not buy the Filiquarian Publishing version  The translation is poor as well as the editing  It reminds me of reading unintelligible assembly instructions for foreign products You will not enjoy reading this book It is a great book but not this version
It is the book all business people need It show simple ideals  to simple situation for everything I recommend it to all
Came really fast and in good condition
Were currently processing your review and we will email you at c as soon as this is complete Good bye
Timeless classic for understanding the daily struggle of humanity otherwise known as life
The translation is nice
not much lost in the translation The condition of the book is great and fast shipping
Great book for a great price When you can find literature like this for free you cant help but download it
very good service and product
a must read alotta the tactics r already in place in our country with all the diversionary tactics in this book
spine broken
A wonderful book to learn from past ages strategy that is timeless My year old son asked for Christmas I guess college is helping
I made it through Thats all we can ask for from my very limited reading skills Have a good year
good book and story and best of all free what more could you want free everyone should read great for collage and military
great product
Most people go through life using tactics While Sun Tzu does give great tactical advice
he also show in this book that having an overall strategy is the key to success  It is a military guide
I enjoyed reading this simple and to the point translated version of the book The translated text of The Art of War means that the meaning of the words have further been interpreted for the English language It allows therefore the reader to interpret also the words for the modern day context of daily life
It was good reading Short and concise for the price
I cant get my husband to join me using this product with an e reader With the book its great
This is one of those classic must read books It has been around for ages and for good reason too
amazing price
A very insightful book that can be taken metaphorically as well as literally This books reads in a number format that simply gives tips on warfare
Excellent bare bones version of the classic  No commentary etc  Just the original book
he gives a general overview of conducting war I didnt care for the commentaries
the greatest military mind that ever has walked this planet I will read his over and over
how to do it A step by step instruction manual on how to wreak havoc and influence people If you enjoy war as much as I do
I though I was getting the whole book  Probably missed that in the product description  It still let me get a decent idea of what the book was about
 Cheap binding  Cheap paper  Poor translation  Typesetting looks like it was done in Notepad  Lots of grammatical errors  Paragraphs not laid out correctly I bought this for my father as a Christmas gift and was taken aback at the low quality of this product Seems like it was selfpublished or similar Would NOT recommend
Very good experience     would defintely order from Vendor again          
The introduction is the best part of this book I think thats the closest you can get to a biography of Sunzi
A Classic  Rereading it is always a gaining of new insights
I immediately realized the influence this book has said not only in military strategy but also in business The strategies mentioned in the book has been repeated throughout history and I enjoyed that the Chinese General was very straightforward in good descriptions No sugar coding
is all black and white and its up to the reader to form hisher opinion on it Im positive many corporate tycoons used the strategies for corporate takeovers and countries have used the book as a way to win wars and sack cities This can be pretty dangerous season in the wrong hands so I recommend anyone in a leadership position to delve into this short but concise book for a few hours
Great book and great price
Not complete works Not good for a school edition
Still a modern reference for the psychology of war
Good book to compare modern military theory to the past
Some great advice in here The whole book is literally aphorism after aphorism
I may have ordered the wrong version of this book because it was not at all what I expected
I received Thomas Clearys translation of Sun Tzus Art of War in a trouble free
for a great price  When it arrived
I found the book in excellent condition
I couldnt be happier with the purchase
The best damn tactics and strategy book ever
Very good condition book
Have read before several times and given away my copy  This one will Be kept and given to s grandson when old enough  The world is not all seashells and balloons and critical thinking needs to be taught
Very straightforward edition  Nice layout
One of the best books ever written
A stable in my collection  Well written and simple
Great epic book Great edition
What a great book of common sense and Long life lesson in daily lives  Makes me want to play chess
Got it in new condition
Love it There are so many good strategy tip use in life Very easy read
arrived in good condition
Great book download was easy price was right
good book would recommend this to anyone to read very interesting subject have read a couple times now hard to put down
This book is relevant for todays tactics The principles are timeless This book should be required reading for anyone in leadership
A very interesting read Can be a little stale if you arent into tactics on the battlefield Otherwise a nice treatise on the tactics used in war
One of the best strategic books Ive ever read in my life The lessons in this book are applicable to every aspect in life
An easy read with a lot of sensible information Helps to give insight for strategic actions that may be employed in both life and war
I was very surprised that the story for the most part is mostly intact  How hard is it to get the Art of war right  I did feel that some of the softening of the language was not necessary and I believe a strait translation would have gone a long way in bringing this book back to the iconic level it has enjoyed all these years
Printing quality average
to be used when conducting warfare Sun Tzu was thousands of years ahead of his time Anybody with even a remote interest in military tactics needs to read this book
Great read Should if it isnt already be required reading for all college students The Art of War is a suggestive manual on combat by Sun Tzu that can easily be looked upon as a guide in the world today
Is it only me who finds the translation of this book is nonsense I might have bought the wrong version
The book is a short version of the actual one
Its The Art of War of course its good and for the Kindle price its well worth it
Good but not the best translation
The worst part of this book is that the print is off center and lopsided like it wasnt printed correctly If youre like me then you can look past that and just enjoy the book
the book has no printing on the endwhich makes it hard to see on a book shelf Not that big of a deal to me because I know where it is and lets honestthats all that matters If however you are one of those pretentious douchebags that likes showing off just cultured you are
 timeless wisdom
Different from what I expected and loved the strategies Shows me that everything has to be analytical in business
I have study the art of war from a tv point of view never read the book from this author I did look at a page or so and I thinks any and everyone who deals with life can learn from this book and help them with life problems and situations if the book meet what I seen on tv it will meet my expectations  and more   thanks for reading my review and more
The first quarter of the book is all introductions and someones essay on the life of Sun Zhu The rest of it you have to suffer through the editors notes and opinions ever other paragraph I would rather pay to not have to deal with it than to get it free and suffer through it I expect it to be a good read and nothing against the book but those version is garbage
Hard read Great strategic planning when it comes to war planning
can be useful in so many ways outside of war Business
if you really think about it you can make sense of what the author was saying  I feel like a wealthy famous individual say said this book was great so other people said it was great which started a trend I bet if the Kardashians all the fashion bloggers in the world would post a pic with this book saying they loved it  Buy the book for looks
strategy is usable in all aspects of life and after reading this I gained a better understanding of how some things within the world work  A great business strategy guide
not as in depth as expected
good book with notes
and noticed almost immediately it was almost a word for word copy of Clavells edition of THE ART OF WAR  I sent it back the same day Amazon was great about it
This was a brief overview of the actual book The cheap price was due to the fact that it isnt the actual book
This is a masterful book and will provide sound advice for any battle in your life you might face no matter how big or small
although this is product was excellent
Very interesting ideas Its quick and to the point
and will leave you with lots of new knowledge that you can use in life
The strategies in this book can be used in modern life The author was an excellent thinker Great book to reference
Its an interesting book that was written in something like  BC  This is considered a loose translation of the original and has been condensed down into basic understandings about how to win wars  It would be a quick read  Its a brutal topic
Not its best translation  I felt something was missing
if only for the modern day references  The simplicity and common sense approach can appear boring until you apply it to other areas of your life
This translation isnt the best
but it definitely gets the point across for a low price
Very good book to learn strategy
A true classicapply it to daily living and winning strategies Short and simple
Good read Analogies could be drawn to various aspects of business and competitive strategies if read with some thought process
civilian business sector
Brilliant man whose ancient tactics still stand today and can be applied to many different arenas from business
Obviously a great collection in this book You can dispute the greatness of Art Of War Nothing I can say will add to its historical importancetoo many different philosophies
The Art of War audio book is read by BD Wong and Ron Silver  Ron Silver has a really calm yet serious reading voice
Sun Tzu often wrote about the importance of strategy and the wisdom that he shared is still extremely applicable today whether youre referring to business
easy to apply to present time Great insights about a great leader
cool super nice reader and easy ro to follow good translation into English I enjoy this book great book to read
This translation has many typos and errors Very sloppy Find a different translation for this excellent text
this is a good translation of the art of war
A must read for anyone interested in strategy Its a classic
What a great way to get books
this book offers succinct advice for military commanders It reminds me of Machiavellis The Prince
which offers succinct advice for rulers Both books are brief Both books offer astute and sometimes provocative guidance Both books derive additional interest from their historical importance But I found The Art of War by far the easier read part of a single afternoon
The Prince was hard going Two quotes to give a flavor of the book All warfare is based on deception Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting I highly recommend this book
but not this specific edition
which appears to use the Lionel Giles translation without bothering to credit Mr Giles deceased he may be
and the ninth chapter has been moved forward without explanation
Buy a different version The person who wrote this ruined the book Im still trying to find a better version
This is a great book that covers strategies for more than just warfare Very concise and top the point Easy to read
she said by the author that overwhelms Sunzi Many people have mentioned his sayings yet one has to pick through the bale of hay to find those needles of wisdom so delicately placed
Dr Giles translation is excellent for academics
and those attempting to Sun Tzus principles to endeavors unrelated to military purposes It is not as useful for the fields for which it was intended
however those being the military and intelligence fields Readers from those professions are better served by the translations by Griffith or Sawyer
who share more relevant insights than the less experienced Giles
Like the book just thought it would have more pages but an easy read
great for quick reading and reference
This book is loaded with lots of information All of it is thought provoking Worth the read if you have an extra couple hours
Fast and Flawless shipping Book is in great condition and I especially like the slightly larger fonts
The book The Art of War was in excellent condition and the purchase process was easy I would recommend this to anyone interested in the book
Should be mandatory teaching early on in schools
Not sure how to apply the information yet
i will probably buy another text with interpretation of the original
as i would like an opinion of how it applies to real life and or business life
and it is crap I read the first half of that crap so I can see why so many people are mad at it Just skip it and read Suns words
but its a good smaller version of the more detailed readings it summarizes well
Lot of ancient wisdom in this little book I will definitely refer to it 
this is more commentary than the actual Art of War Its remarkable how hard it is to find a simple copy of the Art of War
Very stragetic book good for the mind Recommend this book to friends and family like the book because it was straight to the point
you can get this on the internet for free but its nice to have it on book form
Great classic Sun Tzu was a military master
good deal
It is a great read Very useful for business and life every one should read this book and keep it handy
Great book and information for those of us that move strategically and think critically
introduction or extra frills of any kind For the dirt cheap price
The book was described in enough detail that I knew I was ordering the exact edition that I needed and the condition was exactly what I was looking for in a book Delivery was very fast and the price was the best I was able to find I hear repeatedly about how this book should be read if you are interested in the subjects of national security or simply to get an understanding of current world events  These recommended reading lists should be updated as there are many far better books on the theory or aggression
and theory of war  The complexity of our current socioeconomic arena and how the world responds often defies explanation utilizing historic strategies and theories
Great classic No complains since I got this for free Always a good book to have in your library for reference
Arrived in great condition
Pretty dry really Likely a good read for new andor youthful military enthusiasts
The military still studies this book today  To bad the politicians didnt have it during Viet Nam
this book is a self help of sorts that helps you to view different situations in life in general from a different perspective and in so doing help you think of ways to overcome andor cope with them This version
is smaller than I expected and the quality of the print was pretty good
It is easy to see why this book has become required reading for so many senior military officers  It has stood the test of time like none other  I highly recommend it for military and civilians alike
THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL BOOK I rated this five stars to help make others aware of a glaring issue with this product and to help project the voice of those who rated it one star and had this similar issue This listing fails to show within the description that this is the abridged version of the book
unfortunately I wasnt aware of that and for a quick summary of what the actual book has to offer this does the job but shame on the seller for not clarifying what people are purchasing
This book will change how you look at a lot of the situations that regularly drive you crazy during the course of the day
I love this book It is very simple and easy to read I can grasp the concept reasily Thanks a bunch
This book is straight forward and understandable A surprising amount of the advice can be applied today  to nonmilitary circumstances
Was a great price and was in perfect condition
and I havent gone as far as read the contents but the translation looks pretty easy to understand
the chapter divisions seems neat
The quality of this product is pretty satisfying It is very good price and the thing I liked the most was the speed of delivery It arrived  times faster than expected
This book is timeless and will always have reread value It came in great condition and without delay I would recommend to anyone who likes to read books that can be applied to real life situations
So good and informative I ordered this for a friend going into politics
And excellent guide to the basics of military organization and general life practices A must read work if ever Ive seen one
The commentaries in between each paragraph can be annoying to read through before the actually paragraph is finished It might be amazons ridiculous design that ruins the literature
because the original text is inspiring
each passage by Sun Tzu is immediately followed by several different interpretations of that passage  It is difficult to read because the book is so broken up by other translators  Very annoying
Great translation Very smooth and easy to read Recommend for anyone looking to transform an ancient acumen into a business advantage
Classic book came quick in great condition Excited to read Shorter than expected
but features several juvenile typos that lend a jarring immaturity to this type of text
Read the item description carefully This book is only  pages long and only highlights important parts of the book
The foundation of eastern strategic thought
This book is very useful if you are playing a strategic war game or planning on joining a military Not to mention that this teaches you useful vocabulary and tactics All in all great In my opinion
The person rewriting this classic piece of work adds in too much of his own commentary It makes for difficult reading in regards to when sunzi is instructing and when this rewriter is commenting It was like reading books
good edition
Every American war fighter should be required to study thisIts ancient wisdom
Great book for people who want a strategy book It has many complicated words and sometimes you have to think about what he means or is trying to say
good insight for leadership and influential people
years ago this book is fanatastic and eery but full of insight with wise perspective Highly reccomended to everyone
Highly recommended  Thanks to Sun Tsu I can deal with conflict from a knowledgable position  I look back and see some of my shortcomings and failures and see I could have been successful had I this information
Reading this text through the lens of Christian doctrine has shown that many archetypal beliefs exist among men of faith Within this text
war is the last option and not the first This ancient book of wisdom contrast with the practices of many modern world leaders The translators introduction often references the  Tao te Ching which might also be excellent reading for the man of faith who hopes that the can communicate his beliefs with others who have a background in Eastern philosophy  Corinthians  If sustained peace ever enters this modern era
the text states that the greatest warrior can win a war without fighting a battle Unfortunately
this text often is read by greedy
powerhungry individuals who do not seek peace and are misled by the title The teachings which I contains can be used for good or evil With this text
one can heal difficult situations or promote anarchy as the modern physician can heal or kill with prescription medicine This is a powerful text and excellent reading
and there is no apparent effort to make the ideas visually clear I would steer clear of this printing and invest in a betterpresented edition of the book
fresh commanders who are looking for advice
product came in very great condition
Or perhaps this is simply horse sense But refined by an acute mind Also a fascinating glimpse of a bygone period
Rating got of  because of the total knowledge that is produced by the original text How it relates to life in society as we know it
the size of the book was disappointing standard paper book
Arrived in excellent condition
but it definitely it the most powerful for its size  True insight and understanding of how to tackle and conquer any obstacle
recived them in a timely manner  good job on getting them to her in time for school
good advice for lifes battles in the work place Its interesting that his stratagem holds true in the st century
the strategies are excellent and reading was fast I would recommend it for coaches and salespeople
Excelent version of the classic Sun Tzus Art of War
Overall it was a good read but was a bit confusing with all the translations The format could have been better but its worth reading at least once in your life
Easy read Informative and insightful information
It was a really good book at a great price My daughter ordered it She liked it very very much
Basic and Brilliant About  pages Small and thin Took me less than  minutes to fully read Has different strategies
but lacks the examples found in certain other editions Also the text seems to be missing certain vital points
Has great business and organizational leadership value
The ending of this book clarifies to not always as a leader let your follows know the entire plan is finished until it takes place  The killing of spies is not an easy part of this book to swallow  Christ did say He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword
Another one of the greatest books of all time
my daughter needed this book for an assignment and it was very easy to purchase  Thank you very very much
Its a good book to be familiar with the concepts but its a pretty boring read  Like has been said about this book the ideas can be used in every part of life in general
just a basic OUTLINE reviewing key concepts and principles I do not recommended this product to anyone
i received it on time and in very good condition  it was a gift and he said he enjoyed it
Book in excellent condition
This book was easy to read with the notations and references It is also practical for everyday use in getting ahead in your career  especially in corporate America Just use your imagination
I didnt realize the book was just a bunch of quotes most of which you can find online for free Some relevant information you can use when negotiating
IT IS One of the best books I Have ever read it gives many applications for aspects it is A must read
A must for anyone owning a business You will have be outside the box and way out in to the limits of normal thought
Did not like the assorted commentary and a little obtuse translation
but it seems to be a highly abbreviated outline of the original Art of War  Still
The Art of War is a solid meditation not only on the nature of war
per the reviews I bought this one but it lacks in what we were looking for Very thin compared to ones we have seen so I must have misread the description Still lots of wonderful info
This is NOT Art of War but rather the bad version of its cliff notes Amazon should not promote this as Sun Tzus book No efforts was made towards basic editing or printing this book Its cheap paper with really bad ink The brown Amazon box it arrived in is far superior than this book
Apply to real business world
marketing practices and can be taken as the book on effective leadership Old but effective theory
but not an easy read for western culture folks Still worthile though
I have had this book numerous times and keep reading it until I need a replacement The strategies in this book can be applied to most any situation in business and has been read by every American President except the current one And it shows
Translator seems to be writing his own book about the famous book  Very hard to follow as it is became a very boring history book about a book
Basic text for understanding a classic
Many typos and formatting problems  The only good thing to say about this translation is that it can put you to sleep  instantly
A clear and understandable textbook of military science
find a free pdf on the net and print it yourself just  pages because sadly
Sun Tzu is taught world wide for a reason  The man may not have came up with these all by himself but he understood them  A winner  Sun Tzu not Hollywood is the great teacher about human conflict
great insights when seen from the era this was written true warfare wisdom for those times
This is not a work of fiction or a novel Its more a technical manual on the various components of war
there is distilled wisdom and many stories and dead bodies behind it No word is used meaninglessly
The alternative translations and historical background makes this my favorite interpretation
I bought the book for a friend Therefore I am unable to review the content
The philosophies of Sun Tzu are easily transferable to present time in the corporate world and in everyday business  I am grateful that my professor suggested that I read this book
a fantastic book that came in great condition that all soldiers should have a copy of
Good book Quality of book was good for the price Was delivered promptly
Useful in so many aspects of life One can convert the principles in this book to be objective in any social condition
I have heard about this book for years and I am glad to now have a copy  It is a simple translation but a clear one making understanding this thinking
It got delivered as promised and in great condition
The best daily version of The Art of War that I have
This is more of a review of the book than the actual book Very hard to read on a kindle due to all the names and annotations
This is the basic text of the ancient text
This is an thoughtful and enlightening book which the strategies can be transferred to be used on our everyday lives
Overall quality is OK great for the price which is free Reads good
but for free it cannot be beat and Ill stick with this version
What can you say  excellent book at an excellent price  I purchased five copies this time around for people I knew so they could read through the wisdom of this ancient leader and apply it to their every day life
I guess The whole book is a jumbled mess of hanging paragraphs   and stray indents that ruin the flow of the words  star from this casual English student
I guess i was expecting more but for the time frame the man was brilliant  I guess I was looking for more of an explanation of war in a more modern view  My rating reflects a more personal view
Bought it for a friend as a bday gift  I was proud to give it as a gift  High quality
This is such a great edition The commentary is fabulous  I have listened countless times and it never gets old
Very simple design and a good translation
As with any ancient text
translation matters greatly Fortunately
this version isnt fraught with errors and mistranslations
common in free ebooks The content needs no praise or introduction as it remains an influential and widely applicable text A recommended read
Excellent version of The Art of War Not much extra derails or commentary
but very good translation of the works
well written  A timeless treatise as has ever been
My recent purchase of the Art of War was Utopian Success The product was perfect I am going to order  more Thank you very much Amazon Paul Kuzinski  A very satisfied customer
difficult reading due to ancient text and translation
just very brief and cryptic translation that was meaningless to me Glad it was relatively cheap
poor translation
and not the full original  Wanted the full version
I suppose you can Sorta  But after a while it gets exhausting hearing about how you need to wake up earlier than your enemy know more than youre enemy be more rested than your enemy blah blah blah  Long story short
study hard  Work hard  Im glad I have quenched my curiosity
it reminds one of the old instrucktional books for the vcr The opening of the book is a sleeper I heard so many good things about it and then was greatly disapointed This is for file thirteen a real snoozer If you have trouble getting to sleep read this
not my cup of tea even though it offered advice on how to strategical fight a war
Dear Customer Service Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy  the teachings of one of the Chinese Great Thinkers and enjoy their rich history
I expected a bigger book what I received is like an abridged version
One of the best books to read
It is a book that you have to read over and over again to understand its content and relate the strategies to real world action Too much information packed in a tiny book
good information
The translation given to me had a ton of grammatical errors
good classic book Bit thin I think the chinese version is better Translation is a bit ackward in English
Not what I expected It literally talks about war I heard it was a philosophical book Fast shipping Good condition
amazing wisdom and utility Trump must have read this and is using it We had best learn it too
I was excited to read the art of war When i started reading it i was very dissappionted I think it is a very confusing read Tthe translator is all over the place and then includes his own thoughts Me and everyone else needs to find a bettercopy
Okay so I got this for a school project because it was the cheapest on the website under the impression it was a full  page book If you are looking for the full length book DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT This book is no more than  pages long If you are just using it for a reference book or something then its okay I guess
Great read didnt get first x I read but when actually get into to it it makes sense and is awesome must read Either this paper pack or that hard copy which like a bible has all kinda books written inside and hard copy well over  pages easily huge wanna good read get that one like  worth then read paper back explains the art and paper breaks it down like dummies for the art of war Im disabled long and short term memory y had read So much But I retained it finally well most part But if not into all that reading which Ive had over a ur and not even half way done get paper back it maybe or so pages Easy read Took me an  to read and I dont really read so easy to read over and over so I can remember it Something everyone needs to read regardless of life job or religion
If you think reality is just a series of bizarre coincidences
the ways of this have been around for a long time now we have the art of texing and tis a great book for centering the soul in battle i have used it many times in life
Excellent Timeless advice from a tactical master
is easily translated into the realm of corporate strategy A must have for everyone who wants to climb the corporate ladder
excellent price
popular apparently in business schools and elsewhere
I thought it was a poor translation
This is a beautiful edition
and is longer than ish pages like it says here Seems good though
This version doesnt have the best editing IX chapter is between IV and V
just i dont get the whole message because I need a modern translation and thats not this dvds fault
This is a real classic that all business people should read once in a while I am happy to have chosen it and it was shipped extremely quickly to me so I go back to reading it sometimes when I need a thoughtful advice
I had bought into the hype over how The Art of War is the greatest strategic document ever produced  I was expecting some fantastic insight and in reality
like most brilliant strategies
very simple and basic steps to follow  The trick is to not overlook the basics and keeping the discipline to always follow them The book itself was set up into a very long and rambling prologue
I will keep the substitute books because they are useful and different  Instead of sending me the books I ordered
clear and concise easy to read and reread to get better understanding
this book is placed in the Public Domain This version of the book is not the best quality you will get although it is very cheap
Not what I was expecting  A bad order on my part
to give to a young adult now moving out into the world
Gave me a different book in the middle of the Book Wtf I only didnt mind because it was vegan recipes
A classic and a perfect gift for any young person just accepted by one of our outstanding military academies  Not a good book for lefties
really disappointed waste of my money and this paper supposely book was fill with quotes printed papers stapled together wth
Highly applicable to business and other careers
This was a present for my neices birthday  she absolutely loves it The seller shipped quickly and the product was in great shape as described Thank you
Sun Tzu philosophy on war is nothing short of incredible Phenomenally written and simplistic at the same time
It was a photocopy with tiny letter type I was so disappointed as I was planning to give this to my boss This edition is aweful Spend a couple of bucks more and get a decent edition I cant describe how bad this is
The book was written a long time ago so it is difficult to enjoy it from my point of view because it spoke of basic routines in fighting aspects of war They are basic compared to how we wage war these days and they look primitive in nature
I have just downloaded the kindle edition The pagination is awful rendering the text to be almost unreadable amazon need to up their game and not charge for this abysmal level of quality of reproduction
good price quick sshipping
in fact midway through the book there are a our twenty plus pages that are out of order and from some other book Crap
I was under the impression it would be the full length book  This is a case of false representation
I would of left a positive review if i were to have received my product considering i purchase it nearly  weeks ago
this book is frequently listed as one one of the best business books on various lists it is okay but it is not a great business book
great advice
really good for the price I loved it
very good translation If you looking for the best translation it is The Art Of Strategy by Rl wing
Charging for free information
but the one I got is terrible The version with the black cover
but they are riddled with typos Pg  actually page  While heading the profit of my council The word is heeding Almost certainly an English as a second language translator who didnt run this by a decent editor Yeah
they know English better than I know Chinese
thanks for the bathroom material amazon
This did not mention that it was an abridged version
The translation is clumsy and needs improvement  Copy editing is sloppy  Numerous typos
and format errors  Serves as a cheap option
you are going to use the ancient art of war to deal with daily trivia or business critical things
in every chapter It is best to win without fighting Management of many is the same as management of few It is a matter of organization A leader leads by example not by force Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons And they will follow you into the deepest valley Speed is the essence of war And many many others Sound familiar Right They are used by everybody taken out of the context Especially by life  career  business coaches of all kinds Midlevel managers
not by military professionals I can hardly believe that somebody who has professional military education will learn anything from this book Its nothing more but a common sense Like do not fight when you can Cmon We all know that already Hide your weaknesses and strength from the enemy Of course Ill do Attack at the weakest point Sure
nobody wants to die in a suicide mission fighting outnumbering entrenched enemy And so on I can hardly believe that modern military commanders use Sun Tzus terrain
battlegrounds and positions categorization As well as any other typification from this book You can now bomb an enemy or send a drone Or a nuke Or a SEAL squad Infantry and cavalry lost some of its importance during the last  years passed The war despite war never changes has changed a lot since then Think about this the book was actually written by Sun Tzu for his master
state of Wu And the role of this book is clear too to summarize the knowledge available at that time So
the book cannot be used by its direct purpose nowadays  to teach military personnel
and it became popular in another roles to be a source of quotes for people who want to show others that they read smart books and to be used for inspiration
is nothing special but a common sense of yearold war practice
I began by reading an annotated version of the Art of War and switched midway to the original text because although the notes you can find in the free version on Amazon
it was a bit disruptive and I wanted to read the original text before digging deeper That said
this is a fascinating book to read simply because it makes so much sense for so many things For people in business
the metaphors are easily adaptable to a business model and no doubt this book has been read by many a high ranking official if only to gain understanding of what it takes to win The same could go for coaches and even lawyers Basically any scenario where there are two sides and both are seeking to be the victor can benefit from this But there are some interesting ways where you can adapt what is said in this book To mediate conflicts you can use many of the same steps and recommendations postulated within The main thing that is sought from the Art of War is to win with as little bloodshed as possible For many
avoiding all that is what makes the best general If you can position things to the point where engaging in battle is folly and thus surrender is a better option
theres another application I can recommend having this text be read by writers Conflict is embedded in what we write and for us who write fantasy and science fiction
battles on paper are common place If you want to make a battle believable
and the mistakes that are part of a believable scenario A rich read that will no doubt yield knowledge in its original and annotated versions
A very brief summary of most of the key phrases or quotes from the original classic Add graphic artwork  entertaining introduction to the classic  I recommend it  Buy the hard copy
not Kindle It is not the original full edition of the classic This Smartercomic is not intended to be the full text I read the Art of War or Strategy in college and several times thereafter I refer to it periodically The critics miss the point of this edition  an introduction and entertainment After reading this edition
A Overview The ancient Chinese military general Sun Tzu lays out a blueprint for the effective waging of war In his classic The Art of War
the successful war campaign largely revolves around two key elements deception and surprise Sun Tzu also describes the virtues that are required of effective military leaders
he gives wide ranging and insightful advice on knowing oneself
that he may grow arrogant I Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline
courage and strictness I Discipline among the Commanders and soldiers is the key to victory One can even determine which side in a war will be victorious by asking  Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law  Which of the two generals has most ability  With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth  On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced  Which army is stronger  On which side are officers and men more highly trained  In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment I  The Law of Deception The Law of Deception is summarized by Sun Tzu with these words All warfare is based on deception Hence
and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you XI  Law of Surprise Attack Surprise is also an important element in weakening the enemy The military is to appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend march swiftly to places where you are not expected VI
in immovability like a mountain VII Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night
fall like a thunderbolt VII  Effective Warfare The rest of the treatise focuses on how to wage war in an effective manner War is to be waged by first knowing oneself and knowing ones enemy Battle is never undertaken unless one is certain that he will win Sun Tzu outlines the five principles of victory  He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight  He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces  He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks  He will win who
waits to take the enemy unprepared  He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign III A successful war campaign is waged efficiently
for supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting III Few resources are to be expended in an effective war campaign The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy
neither are his supplywagons loaded more than twice II Sun Tzu also seems to hint at a metaphysical plane in which warfare is fought He writes
that the effective Commander wins his battles by making no mistakes Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory
as though war is first fought on some metaphysical plane before the victory and defeated is reflected in the visible
physical world B Critique Some of Sun Tzus counsel is outdated in the age of terrorism
and digital and nuclear warfare Some of it revolves around the size and numbers of the enemys forces and ones advantage relative to the enemy based on numbers Similarly
much of his advice is based on obsolete forms of land warfare that are rarely fought in the modern day He writes
will be fresh for the fight whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted VI This advice will rarely
be relevant in an age where most warfare is fought in the air or from long range missiles
with forces rarely clashing in land battles The advent of nuclear weapons also changes the entire equation of relative forces and makes the numbers of infantrymen almost irrelevant Similarly
the introduction of insurgencies that blend into local populations have been able to render even large armies of well equipped soldiers ineffective and unsuccessful Furthermore
the advent of digital and cyberwarfare makes the numbers of enlisted and commissioned soldiers largely irrelevant to foreign attacks Though the forms of warfare have changed over the ages
the laws of deception and surprise attack are still relevant and highly effective Furthermore
Sun Tzu outlines lessons that are important not only for the battlefield
is actually no bigger than a pamphlet If you are looking for a larger version
there are a vast amounts to choose from and can range significantly in page count depending on how much additional comments and stories they want to include If you just want what was written without all the filler
I began this book wondering how a centuriesold text could be applicable to twentieth century business negotiations  I finished it wondering why modern business books are so irrelevant  Rather than summarize
while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win   There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare   The greatest victory is that which requires no battle   When you move
fall like a thunderbolt   Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons And they will follow you into the deepest valley   Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across   When you surround an army
leave an outlet free Do not press a desperate foe too hard Sun Tzu combines a startling humility with a stunning sense of responsibility  He could not care less who gets the glories of victory  He would prefer to be called a coward and win
then a hero and lose  Sun Tzus chief aim is not to fight
body and spirit until they cannot lose In a world that prides itself on external victories
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is the timeless classic on the manners of warfare The book itself is quite short but the wisdom contained in it means that it is quite a dense book to read anyway While we may now read The Art of War and think that we know most of the things
I imagine it was simply a monumental book back then Even now some of the passages contain immense value and many principles still apply The principles outlined in this book are not only applicable to ancient Chinese warfare but many can interpreted in the world today While many of the principles regards itself on positioning and strategic decisions some other principles struck me as well Principles such as To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands
cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays are applicable to everyday life as well This arguably makes it one of the rare books which transcend the domain in which it was once written in and shows us something that is fundamentally human and gives us the opportunity to improve ourselves
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is an ancient Chinese military treatise The book
a classic within the science of military studies is only attributed to the high ranking general and was believed to have been complies during the last spring and autumn of the Warring States periodeither  BC or  BC I first heard of The Art of War by Sun Tzu when I was in the military I heard of the book in passing and read a bit more about it when I got home
whether external or internal I can certainly see how the advice applies to ancient warfare
you will be imperiled in every single battle Profound advice from a great general  one does not go into any competition without knowing the opponents Athletes do not step onto the field without spending house analyzing every available movie showing their opponents at play and generals dissect enemy strategies to tiny details before forming their own
I really enjoyed this narration It was easy and pleasant to listen to and the voices didnt detract from the information I was trying to soak in This would be a good book to have a hard copy of or to reread several times to master all the principles and ideas presented within it The Art of War was written by Sun Tzu
a Chinese general and war strategist  years bc It is a manual regarding war strategy and its main principles can be adapted for leadership
so that he cannot fathom our real intent  We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors  To obtain complete obedience and discipline you must administer ruthless punishment for disobedience on a regular basis Small sacrifices are necessary for achieving the greater good Yes
interpersonal conflict
I think it is most interesting as an actual treatise on warfare
and tactics as originally intended Comparing the tactics and outcome of various battles and wars past and present to Sun Tzus advice demonstrates that he generally knew what he was talking about and many most of his principles still hold true This translation made a serious effort to preserve the ambiguities present in the original
giving it a much more Eastern flavor than some older translations I cant vouch for translation accuracy since I cant read the original
but Cleary at least sounds a bit more authentic than Giles the classic English translation The commentary sections sometimes gave insight into how Master Sun was understood by others over the next few centuries
etc this is definitely a great read Next time you watch a war movie or play a conquertheworld type game youll find yourself thinking in terms of The Art of War
you will always endanger yourself The Art of War is the most prestigious and influential book on strategy that has ever been written Sun Tzu showed how organizations can thrive in times of conflict and chaos by mastering five things the way
business is like modern day warfare That always stuck with me
years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu It is a must have for military buffs that enjoy reading about the tactics of the most succesful generals It is rumored that Napoleon used a French translation of the Art of War to his advantage while conquering most of Europe
and he lost when he broke its principles The principles that are with in this ancient text can also be used in games of strategy
and the day to day battles of life Here are ten principles to give you a sample of the wisdom found in its pages Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance with out fighting If you know the enemy and know yourself
you need not fear the result of a hundred battles Spies are the most important element in war
because upon them depends an armys ability to move All warfare is based on deception The general who wins a battle makes many calculations before the battle is fought There is no instance of a country having benefited from a prolonged war The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy
the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak When you surround an army
fight not unless the position is critical Taken as a whole this is a book of wisdom and principles on how to win I rank it in my top ten books I have ever read It is a must have for any home library The is a very small book that is quick and easy to read
years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu
being a a timeless masterpiece of interaction of power and politics this book teaches many good lessons to anyone who will ever have to command a group of people
or on the battlefield The Art of War is an ageless book that teaches human nature and how to deal with difficult situations in life and business The lessons learned in this book can be allied to relationship
career and make you a more complete person in general I I recommend this book to be read by all those who wants to succeed in anything they do
and rational  The descriptions are poetic but to the point  Some passages are brilliant and selfevidently true
but the entire work is engaging and worth readinglistening to  One can see why it is required material for military strategists and why so many people have called it the most important reference work on the subject of war of all time  One of the most striking aspects to me personally were the apparent logical contradictions  Act honorably because the moral high ground is critically important to military success
yet you must remain open to opportunity and adjust your tactics accordingly throwing out the rules  This is not to say the lessons are false or difficult
as well as several of the anecdotal side stories of ancient battles and strategems Thoughts about the presentationexecution Apparently
the most common and best English translation available translates not just Sun Tzus original words
but also the work of an almostasancient commentator who interspersed clarifications and illustrative anecdotes throughout the main text  Note that this complicates an audiobook
a fundamentally linear form  Textually
deciding if and when to read the tangent  In this particular case
some of the commentary is truly required in place it just wouldnt be understandable to a st century American listener without it and some would best be read outside the flow of the main work such as the stories of ancient battles that illustrate one of the bullet points being made  I believe the producers made the best possible translation from text to audiobook
but moreso than other audiobooks this work would just fundamentally work better as text
This is a decent version of a classic text Its well laid out with a table of contents making it easy to dip in and out The ideas and strategies are individually explained in a couple of sentences
the timeless wisdom contained in this gem by Sun Tzu
has been utilised by many military and business menwomen for profitable advantage This Kindle version of
contains reliable insights and strategies that you can put to practical use in your daily life
readable format Colin G Smith
There are many translations of this work which has long been in the public domain This is the popular translation by Lionel Giles made even more popular by the introduction from the bestselling author of Japan epics
James Clavell It contains Giles commentary along with the translation The annotations give historical examples of the strategies in action Game theory is calculated strategy The Art of War by Sun Tzu is probably the oldest and most important book on game theory ever written It is the culmination of the development of the best warfare tactics prior to the th century BC It is considered the foundation for all military plans and is still used to this day It is most popular for its ability to win wars without fighting one Its application has shaped the world as we know it The Art of War can be understood as a breakdown of the chaos of warfare into components that can be analyzed and understood The tactics are mostly about controlled organization
recognizing environments and situations and the correct response to each one Organization is subject to change in competition The Art of War is essentially the strategy of responding to changing environments Response is thus relative to evolving conditions   Laying Plans The core message of this chapter is to calculate as much as possible before committing yourself Important themes include discipline
environmental conditions and assessing the competition Its about setting up the mission and evaluating the competition   Waging War The important detail of this chapter is to win as quickly and as economically as possible Prolonged struggle means wasting resources and undermining confidence When winning
exploiting opportunities and attacking tactics are covered Strength is about cohesiveness and is independent of size   Tactical Dispositions This one stresses putting yourself in a position where you cannot be defeated and waiting for the opportunity to defeat the enemy It is about recognizing the breaks and taking them as opposed to creating the breaks   Energy This part focuses on the power of deception to lull the enemy into a false sense of security and the use of spies to learn the enemys moves It also stresses the need to evolve in battle Its about building up war capability   Weak Points and Strong This chapter encapsulates all the previous five chapters into an advanced war strategy producing outcomes
potential dangers and obstructions Positioning is important   The Nine Situations This piece explains the condition of each terrain in terms of its tactical advantages and disadvantages and how to deal with both It is a very intensive chapter because of the number of complex conditions dealt with   The Attack by Fire Arson in war is probably the single most troubling weapon that an army could have inflicted on the enemy around  BC This chapter is obviously based on the most advanced weapons of the time which have since been developed It is about using the principle of creating disorder and chaos to win   The Use of Spies Without spies dont war War is won based on foreknowledge not by calculation but by direct information about the plans of the other side from spies Spies are managed in this chapter Even though the work is quite short about  pages or less with commentary it is complex enough to warrant several readings It is the equivalent to learning how to play advanced chess
a game which compliments this study There is a lifetime of thought within the pages Napoleon was said to have used it and lost when he didnt follow it The Art of War has become one of the most important self help books of this century popularized in big business as many executives have had recourse to this material because it offers a sound winning strategy Most readers come away believing that the books message finds it adaptable to many environments because it is all about adjusting to variations and so can be applied to anything and everything The Art of War is not supposed to be an exciting read It is a strategy book
a step by step guide to how battles are won and why they are lost It is more to be memorized as a set of responses
than to be understood The combinations of the responses are unlimited There is enough on the plate without asking why Understanding why would come later and the answers to these questions would come from a very sophisticated understanding of the theory It is an endeavor that remains open to the reader if they can come to terms first with the information that is here Even if the book is not followed up on by subsequent study it can still leave a long lasting impression with its tips on discipline and achieving goals It is great value for the amount of information contained in such a short burst It will get you thinking strategically and that is more or less its claim to fame
The Art of War by SUN TZU is not fiction  Its a Confucianist take on waging and winning wars and business It is important to compare this Eastern view of warfare with the western view as defined in The Prince and many subsequent titles The heart of Sun Tzus thought is All warfare is based on deception Thus
that he may grow arrogant Any football play has all kinds of people running around trying to fake the opposing team to going where the ball isnt Perhaps the best strategic use of the principles was Ronald Reagons Star Wars proposal No one knew if it would work But if it had
and because of their closed society they didnt have the young kid genius programmers that weve developed in this country Although there was an awful lot of complaining about Star Wars in the academic community in this country
sometimes its better to not engage than fight a losing battle or a costly war  That said
it clearly states that a person must be very well prepared The Art of War is an excellent guide on managing conflict Its message that resonated most with me was pursue peace
of the principles have changed,and if you look at any of the wars or battles over the centuriesyou will see that the forces who won the wars,stayed true to these principles,while those who did not follow them were defeated  Not only in warfare,but also in any form of contest from business,sports,politics,personal conflicts,etc,the same principles can be applied and the same results will occur  Of the plethora of books that have been written over the centuries,none has been better at outlining the principles of success and it would be well worth anyones time to read and follow the advice and wisdom found in this classic treatise
years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu It is a must have for military buffs that enjoy reading about the tactics of the most succesful generals It is rumored that Napoleon used a French translation of the Art of War to his advantage while conquering most of Europe
and he lost when he broke its principles The principles that are with in this ancient text can also be used in games of strategy

is still considered essential reading in the area of military studies It is more than just ways to win its a treatise on humanity There is not a single aspect of military positioning that Sun Tzu omits
something the Lionel Giles this is a reprint of his  translation expresses wonderfully There seems to be a frequent misconception that Tzus work is somehow an Eastern version of Machiavellis The Prince This could not be farther from the truth One passage epitomizes this again in pinyin gu yue zhi bi zhiji
but heres a basic translation one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not winning defeating the enemy without battling is the pinnacle of victory Whether youre planning on going into the military
This highly regarded and ancient work has been translated by Thomas Cleary with more subtle thought than other wooden stiff translations  In addition to Clearys introductory commentary
military strategists that followed Sun Tzu These commentaries were written over many years after Sun Tzu and often add depth and perception to the original short text  A strength of Clearys perspective is the relationship of this classic piece of literature with Taoism The secret of this book is that it is actually an antiwar book  Throughout the book Master Sun urges caution
which would make this book of great interest to the corporate world Master Sun advises on how to prepare for conflict
but if engaged in an unavoidable conflict
how to move forward with the greatest chance of victory  Make no mistake
Master Sun does not have a simplistic view of victory since he reminds us that territory defeated must then become territory held
and other methods of assessment are discussed  Master Sun believes that the more fore knowledge the general has
the better he can develop a winning strategy  This leads to a second theme throughout the writing of Master Sun which is the need to develop a strategy for action before taking any action  If anything
the book warns against anger and rash action
etc is no guarantee of success and that it is the cognitive aspects of warfare that can make the essential difference It is difficult to compare this book to that of Machiavellis The Prince since Machiavellis book deals with armed conflict but also with political infighting and the brutal necessities of ruling and leadership Because war is a dirty wasteful business
Master Suns book could be considered a great antiwar book since he warns against anger and revenge and places the center of warfare in the human brain
A common sense approach to war May it be with an army or interpersonal there is always a battle to be fought and won Consider this a short and handy reference guide to outwit your opponent
but I actually saw a number of parts that applied to leadership within my corporate work environment I understand that the translations to English are sketchy at places
but the fact that this edition had more footnotes and author commentary than actual content was quite annoying I skimmed most of that and just read the introductionshistory and the translation itself If I were a general in the armed forces
much of his advice seems pertinent today  And
the work is quite a window into Chinese culture and history  The Kindle edition I read was initially published in 
translated by and including commentary by Lionel Giles  Perhaps the oddest advice by Sun Tzu was for the general to keep his plans hidden from his own forces as well as those of the enemy the most annoying characteristic noted by Giles is the typical Chinese approach of dividing a broad category eg
This ancient book of military strategy has been followed by military men and businessmen for thousands of yearstwo notable ones being Generals MacArthur and Patton This work is attributed to Sun Tzu
and must be avoided whenever possible He felt like capturing an army or city intact was far better than destroying it His book outlines  chapters of military strategy
as other reviewers also note The elementary error on the Table of Contents page with Chapter IX  appearing between Chapter IV  and Chapter V  suggests no professional proofreader or editor involved  The other spelling
and content errors that appear in the text suggest that the material is a largely unchanged Project Gutenberg text file  All in all
the publisher should really release a second edition that fixes the myriad easy to find errors  Particularly since this book is obviously selling well and the publisher ought therefore have the funds with which to do so In the meantime
a comparable edition at the same price but properly proofread and corrected is the Pax Librorum edition which is fully downloadablepreviewable via a PDF eBook at the publishers website  Or just about any other one from more wellknown and established publishers
I am a high school science teacher After reading this volume of The Art of War twice over two years
I realized that my teaching employs Sun Tzus techniques First and foremost
but for the average Jane or Joe who wants the essence of Sun Tzu this is the volume I have given away dozens of copies to various students over the years that I buy used online I also sell my honey and produce at a local farmers market I tell my students that business is legalized warfare Again
pricing and grower reputation James Clavell was brilliant in this edition of a centuries popular text
Badly formatted Only a tiny fraction of the book is original source material the rest is verbose prologue and the editors own explanation of every single quote We cant just relax and read the original
an easy format to read  Every copy of the Art of War I have seen has different commentary in the back in my instance
the commentary had some valuable material
treatise a thoroughly enlightening experience Not only did it provide a rare insight into life back then through the eyes of a general
but it was not written as a historical record The general style feels as if it is simply giving you advice
I would certainly recommend reading this yearold military and political treatise
The last place one would think to get advice and strategies to handle an undesirable work situation The timing could not be more perfect for I fear
and often unwitty comments from an unmentioned coworker The battlefield is in an office space instead of a faraway country
They are just seemingly random pictures from ancient China and have no relation to anything in the text  The text itself is well formated if you want to read all of the annotations and asides and I found most of them quite helpful in understanding the various interpretations of the text and the choices the translator made when bringing it to English However
if you just want the translation of the original text without interruption
this may not be the version for you It would have been best to have set the asides into an annotation section and provide links to them from within the text as I have seen done in other Kindle versions If this is ever updated to do that or if the illustrations had more to do with the text instead of feeling tacked on for the sake of selling this as an illustrated version then I could happily change my rating to five stars
popular chivalry story based on the history of rd century China I think it is a wise idea to read this Chinese classic from Thomas Cleary Translation Had I encountered this from Archaic worded Japanese version I might not get so immersed into it Cleary translation is really understandable even to nonnative English speaker like me Also it is great idea that the interpretation of notables including Cao Cao comes after the Master Suns text Comparing interpretation is really a fun What I am impressed most about this book is it says that if you can avoid the war better not to fight And its idea of how to manage an army is really close to modern idea of organizing groups particularly business corporations Verdict Nice gateway to Chinese classics Rating  out of  Recommended for wide variety of Chinese literature and classic books fans
The original book written in Chinese is a great strategy book
the English translation in this version is so poor that it is obvious that the translator did not fully comprehend nor being able to convey the essense of these strategies Keep in mind that Chinese language must be taken in its entire context
not seperated into individual characters and then translated word for word What the translator has done in this case is equivalent to
the translator automatically translated into Today
it rained heavily Another version of translation published by Publisher Cloud Hands see Amazon amazoncomgpproduct  seem to do a much better job than this version So dont waste your money on this version
This is a welledited edition of Sun Tzu the only aspect that left something to be desired was the inclusion of illustrative anecdotes I would have preferred if they were left to the end of the chapter I can understand why this book was a fad in the business world but object to claims that the tactics described in this book are easily applied to business  This is a book about conflict
and there is much wisdom lost if it is taken out of its context  There is much excellent advice for analogous situations political persuasion and debate
the realm of cooperation in the sense that competing businesses compete to cooperate the best with their customers
even if it is a simple game of Go
and come back later to read it again gaining fresh insight
I boughtgifted this version for all my junior NCOs  I would give it to them on a Friday and I would have them brief me on what they read and how it could relate to them and all the way up to how it can apply to militaries as a whole  I must of bought at least  to  copies of this in the past  It is concise andan easy read  I also have  different versions of The Art of War through different interpretations  This by far the best  It would be nice if Amazon put this in Kindle format
read your history One of the best books I read after this one was about the family that Machiavelli consulted for and wrote the Prince for and about
was very happy to have spent the price it is worth There were two people on this page
or how to apply it to our life today You see philosophy isnt just books written to give you an easy path through life No Philosophy is meant to get the reader thinking and to take what was said and learned before and apply it to their life today Sort of like what Bruce Lee said
it doesnt matter to you I would recommend this book for those who are interested in Chinese history
Im not sure if this is the actual version I wanted to read
I was expecting it to be more In depth and deeper but Found it to be short and even though it is illustrated I am not so sure if this is the go all end all for The Art of War Maybe since my little hardcover book is a Compressed and Abridged or shorter version of the translation I am not sure but either way I found it insightful but certainly not what I was expecting The foreword to my version talks about Fidel and Mao who used the art of war among many others,I dont know why this evil is mentioned,All in All not what I expected
I feel the preponderance of business books has built up the original too much in my mind It just felt very dry Very boring No
This edition is not an abridged version This is the FULL
COMPLETE  ORIGINAL text Apparently another reviewer wasnt too familiar with this work as it isnt overly large but thats the way the complete version is Go complain to Sun Tzu  This edition is exactly what I wanted Its the complete text
it is today more frequently used as an invaluable guide for business strategy Highly recommended
Each section is profound and applicable to almost any endeavor The context and translation is illuminating to an otherwise inaccessible text
Just buy Sun Tsu  Still a good read and does quote Sun Tsu But if on a budget this will give you good quality info
Not the best version of the book
I got this particular edition of Sun Tzus Art of War at a strategy course for sales I already had a copy of it at home
but this edition is so nicely done that I gave my old copy away and kept this one The introduction of James Clavell is a nice touch It is amazing to me that this book is not read in high schools or colleges in favor of Machiavellis work The Prince or The Art of War Sun Tzus writing is clear and to the point Unlike the popular Book of Five Rings by Musashi
this is also a good book to know I mentioned some of the classic strategies while giving a course in China
and gave me many examples from recent Chinese history where Sun Tzus strategies were employed This book is close to their hearts
Sun Tzu was given the task of organizing the emperors many concubines into an army Sun Tzu lined up the concubines and set the two favorites as officers at the head of the columns He gave them a simple set of orders to march and drill eyes front
whirled about and drilled in perfect order  The emperor appointed Sun Tzu general
Few of the classics have that timeless quality that a reader finds enduring The Art of War is one of those
and commonsense advice on how to avert disaster This book has long been a favorite of business executives and entrepreneurs
and I highly recommend its wisdom to anyone in the present day who is trying to make their way in an uncertain and unpredictable world economy This is an easy to read book suitable to people from any walk of life Arm yourself with it and use it wisely Pam Harrison    Tags strategy
but has room to store up to  CDs Product itself This new version gives readers spectacular ambience with the reading  There are  voices within the reading BD Wong I believe is the younger sounding voice
his reading adds a little bit of Asian highlights giving more life to the books reading Ron Silver I believe is the older sounding low voice
clear understanding of the language and tone of the book Both readers do a very good job The other two voices read commentaries
quotes and questions Stefan Rudnicki has a rugged voice deeper low voice Shauna Zurbrugg is the only female voice and gives something different from the male voices There sounds like a th voice at times
but no other reader is mentioned  There is subtle music in the beginningend of chapters it would seem to be an Asian decent lullaby  There is no static whatsoever
Id suggest this one if the price is the same or very close as you will be happy and satisfied If a price is substantially different go with the cheaper one as most readings are very similar for this book in the two readers I have come across
and even the basic vocabulary is lost If you want an idea of how much proofreading was done prior to release
The first time I read this book I found it amazing Sun Tzu was an extraordinary master of the topic Many world leaders of the past and the present have found inspiration throughtout these pages This book has transformed the vision of many people
even the common citizen If you want to gain knowledge and manage art of living facing every day inner war The Art of War is yours
Difficult to read  But very insightful  The strategy of modern warfare  Discussed by Asian warlord a thousand years a go
following the advice of this book The biggest military conquest is to win
this book contains a great deal of useful wisdom  This information is presented in short sentences and statements
so do not expect lengthy dialogue and is most likely a cliff note version of the original but still worth a few dollars  Some of it is obvious and commonsensical whereas other points may be obscure or not obvious to the reader  Regardless
for those who have interest in warfare and strategy it is worth reading
This is a great book for learning  the tactics of war from the eyes of a general
it is one that needs to be taken slowly and in short bursts in my opinion Since the wisdom has transcended time
An excellent way to come across as a learned individual without actually having to obtain a degree in literature The perfect vehicle to aid you in exploiting western societys fetishisation of people who can rattle off seeminglyprofound quotes or make obscure literary references Are you a STEM PhD looking to match one of those Englishliterature majors in displaying a facade of cultured sensitivity This is the book for you
You can easily overlook the depth of this work as it is quite a short and simple read However in terms of symbolism it can be related to many aspects of life and strategy applied past the battlefield I think given the knowledge return on investment for such a quick read
which tells me it was done deliberately  I am likely going to return this item and find a copy that has everything in the correct order
A definite must have for anyone in any field or curriculum
Classic book about the mental and tactical aspects of battle Great read
This book is a must for history buffs and students of life The  year old principles still apply today The concepts touch on how to think like a leader and apply strategies for life and war Sometimes the two are the same This large print edition is a condensed primer that will enlighten you while helping improve your own strategic thought processes
what a classic piece  i ordered this through my kindle for 
the price was perfect  honestly
the content herein can be applied to even peaceful efforts  i highly recommend this book for every cadet in the academies and junior officers  everybody else with an interest in the strategies and tactics of competitive engagement also would benefit from reading this  i give this a solid A
my expectations were high  The Art of War is praised as an alltime classic equally applicable today as when it was first written a philosophical insight into all manners of conflict
I found a brief and simple outline of various battle tactics and tautologies
usually on the level of the field general This is not to say that this is worthless
and for a few insights that are not strictly obvious
or romantic victory over a rival
that some of this depth lies more in the creative extrapolations of the reader than in the work itself
If youre looking to unlock the arcane secrets of modern warfare
this is probably not the book for you Much of the information in this book applies to ancient chinese warfare and general strategytactics
Great and quick read It is a bit of a rough translation but for the most part you get the message Id heard a lot of this book and glad I finally gave it a read
I checked out the free sample and its a copy of the free edition already available through project guttenberg and is free through Amazon So why would anyone pay even a dollar It says its an updated version
it was exactly the same as the free copy I already hadexcept for the jacket cover which with my kindle is utterly useless I wouldnt pay a dollar also on principle
I am going to talk about what is The Art Of War for people who has not read it yet Other reviews on the same page says enough about the edition and publication The Art Of War by Sun Tzu is a precious material to study for military theoriees
this text will give you the tools to make things go your way The text would teach you how to make a plan for anything in daily life and usually that plan would works if ur are basicly smarter than your opponents You can consider yourself as a nation in the text
which makes your move in your work become the army in the text Also socially relationships would be like politics or diplomacy in the book However
knowing which will be a great help on understanding The Art Of War further
I think his most influential work responds only to an era that no longer exists and an era that we shouldnt keep on reviving We must embrace a new system of thought or more applicable political theory
The Art of War has in recent decades been applied to such modern day problems as politics and business  really anything where conflict can surface  It was also suggested reading during my entire time in business school  So
I finally pulled the trigger and read the original or at least the most wellregarded translation The Art of War  The most impressive thing to me which is explained in the introductory material is how well the Chinese recorded their history  My only complaint about the introductory materials was that most great Chinese historical figures have multiple names  this makes it hard to track who is who in some of the commentaries  The actual strategies themselves are full of guidelines on determining your opponents weaknesses
exploiting them and achieving victory  Not exactly full of moral or ethical advice
so I cant use much of it  Im glad that I read it as it gave me a great look into Chinese historybut its practical use in my world is limited
In a time when competition is at its highest
its even more important to go back to a time when the battle was for life or death  If youre in SALES
and to win more when you win  The art of peacefully coexisting will help your clients win and with better results  When your clients know that you are in it for them and willing to coexist with your competition
Amazon handled the exchange of the two books I had to return promptly As to the The Art of War itself
it is of course the most important work on military philosophy ever written at least thats what my husband told me to write I am plowing through the other deluxe edition I received instead of this one with the errors
years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu It is a must have for military buffs that enjoy reading about the tactics of the most succesful generals It is rumored that Napoleon used a French translation of the Art of War to his advantage while conquering most of Europe
and he lost when he broke its principles The principles that are with in this ancient text can also be used in games of strategy
and the day to day battles of life Here are ten principles to give you a sample of the wisdom found in its pages Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance with out fighting If you know the enemy and know yourself
you need not fear the result of a hundred battles Spies are the most important element in war
because upon them depends an armys ability to move All warfare is based on deception The general who wins a battle makes many calculations before the battle is fought There is no instance of a country having benefited from a prolonged war The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy
the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak When you surround an army
fight not unless the position is critical Taken as a whole this is a book of wisdom and principles on how to win I rank it in my top ten books I have ever read It is a must have for any home library The is a very small book that is quick and easy to read
I have read several translations of The Art of War and Thomas Clearys version is by far the best It is a book to be read and reread
concerted and rich in understanding the nature and expression of resistance and conflict Regardless of whether you are interested in deep confrontation
this excellently edited edition will have something of interest for you Published primarily for use in world philosophy and studied at military universities and academies around the world
diversion sampling from one of the most important theorists in the field
this book will continue to be a highly informative source of information for leaders and citizens for years to come And for those who are looking for a more methodical approach to examining our relationship with the world
Basic learning when it comes to tactfully maneuvering the business world
Very inspirational Allowed my wife and I to learn more about psychology and how often many play a victim versus the threat Also goes into detail about being focus and it allowed us to have a better in site in other people behavioral patterns Plus its just an awesome novel
this is a amazing book ,hard strategies but easy to understand   Sun Tzu is a genius and was a great GeneralThis free edition comes with everything includeda great read and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good book to read
I could relate to this as a strategy for family and relationship disputes and business decisions
remain faithful to the mission
This is an awesome book and a great gift idea However
Sun Tzu begins his treatise by saying that The art of war is of vital importance to the State A matter of life and death
expenditure Sun Tzu says that all warfare is based on deception The objective of war is victory Sun Tzu says that if the campaign is longdrawnout
the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain Sun Tzu says that there is no instance of a country benefiting from prolonged warfare Sun Tzu says that there is no merit in fighting and conquering Merit consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting Sun Tzu quotes the proverb If you know the enemy and know yourself
but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by a mistake on the enemys part Security against defeat implies defensive tactics
and the ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive Battles are won by committing no mistakes Sun Tzu says that in war the strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won
whereas the one destined to defeat first fights and looks for victory afterwards Sun Tzu says that in war the direct method may be used for commencing battle
but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory There are only two methods of attack  the direct and the indirect  but in combination these give rise to an endless series of strategies Sun Tzu says that one can be sure of success if one only attacks places which are undefended weak points On the other hand
the safety of the defense can be ensured only if one holds positions that cannot be attacked strong points Sun Tzu says that if one knows the place and the time of the coming battle
one can marshal ones forces from afar Sun Tzu advices the general not to repeat the tactics that have gained one victory again and again The way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak  like water
taking the line of least resistance Sun Tzu says that maneuvering with a disciplined army is advantageous
but with an undisciplined multitude most dangerous An army without its supplytrain
or for the cowardly to retreat alone Sun Tzu says that it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy
nor to oppose him when he comes downhill Sun Tzu says that the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemys not coming
but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable Sun Tzu says that five faults must be avoided Recklessness
A false sense of honor and Over concern for ones troops Sun Tzu says that if fighting is sure to result in victory
then the general must fight even though the ruler forbids it if fighting will not result in victory
then the general must not fight even at the rulers commands The general must advance without coveting fame and retreat without fearing disgrace Sun Tzu says that rapidity is the essence of war And that the army must be kept continually on the move Sun Tzu says that a spirit of enterprise must be cultivated if one wants to succeed in the attack and win the battle Otherwise
and the dead can not be brought back to life For those interested in the study of war and war strategy
Cheap edition of a classic text The information is all there
Ive read several interpretations and translations of The Art of War Although this is not the most famous presentation
This book is red by almost every officer during his or her life It contains so much valuable info about war strategy and life in general
and it for that very reason that this book is everlasting Also recommended The  strategies
Wasnt what I expected but informational and to the point Makes me want to fight lol
Having read about a half dozen versions of The Art of War most with extensive footnotes and difficult translations
perhaps most of this wisdom is simply common sense dressed up in militaristic metaphors I know that some of the popularity behind this book stems from the fact that plenty of its readers usually male are hiphop figures
and budding entrepreneurs Im sure the occasional gang leader took some leadership cues from Sun Tzu was there really a Sun Tzu and this probably created an almost cultlike devotion to an ok book I believe its not quite one of the best leadership books ever
then delve into more modern tomes by folks such as Seth Godin or Guy Kawasaki if youre looking to start a business in todays world In addition
Its a classic that you can read in under an hour One of the best books I have read Simple
and a great strategy foundation I refer to it all the time Great book from a historical standpoint
but certainly is a great asset in business
Sun Tzus writings can apply to all aspects of life and it certainly has helped me I can only imagine how effective this book is for the military
This is well known as the classic text on the subject of both war and business  Theres much wisdom here and you dont have to be a corporate psychopath to appreciate it  Tony Morphett
but The Art of War was just less interesting in my opinion  The most memorable part is early on when Sunzi demonstrates his leadership by training the kings concubines to obey the orders of a general  That story is definitely worth a look
but it is especially good if you want to win at something It doesnt have to be war Anything that requires strategy It has much wisdom I do have complaints though In this print of it
there are far too many notes one fellow said that this was the footnotes That is not true There is a ton of notes put in at the beginning
The translator decided to spend most of his time creating his own content and offering a self serving history lesson rather than just letting the text work as it has for centuries
and every aspect fo day to day living This is deep Taoist philosophy
This is a great book The advice is timeless and not always what youd first expect It has stood well through time and most translations
The book is really presented in a beautiful format Nice Book For Library But
If you know anything about the Art of War its from quotations taken out of context that seem to say something and seem to be profound  The idea is that actual war is a metaphor for the conflicts that one encounters in life and that the advice and tactics are just as applicable Not really This is a book about medieval Chinese warfare and by and large most of it is about precisely that
maybe ninety five percent  If you want to find out how to get good at business
maybe get a selfhelp book  If you are mostly interested in the history of the era
Some translation issues in this I think but you still get a good sense of the book I have read it in  other versions and this is not my favorite
Concise and accessible version of such the famous and prestigious jewel of Oriental and military literature Certainly
Seriously They list this for sale Shameful  Accidentally clicked on it Accidental purchase  Awaiting refund Why would anyone buy this book when it is freely available in public domain with free quality downloads everywhere  Title The Art of War by Sun Tzu
it seems this book would be better titled the art of mastering your ego cultivate the wisdom your aggressor cannot
I enjoyed reading the philosophy about how to be an effective leader and the mindset to succeed in battle and in life
I was disappointed when I started reading this book and onlyd turned two pages when the book ended I was angry I hadnt wasted any money
Those who love this book should now read The Art of Non War  by Kim Michaels The art of war was written from an UNBALANCED state of consciousness  the state of consciousness which states that we are separate beings
our life experience and the life of the planet its self is based upon the interaction of the various energy systems Sand storms in the Sahara desert find its way into the Amazon jungle AND northeastern states in the US  along with all the pollutants emitted from bombs exploded in the middle east and transported to the Sahara by the jet streams in that region
thus affecting weather conditions WORLD WIDE So think twice before we support nuking anyone in that part of the world and  or using munitions manufactured from spent nuclear fuel there is NO art in waronly death and destruction for ALL
not alot of pages also chapter  the army on the march comes right after chapter  in place of chapter   I will probably end up donating this version and purchasing a better edition for my collection
Lil bit confusing but the chapter regarding grounds is very useful The chapter about converting spies also makes sense Nice
the way this type of book should be Substitute tanks for chariots and guns for spears and the book is easily adaptable in todays modern world
I read the hardcopy of this book from cover to cover It is true that the book is celebrated as a classic written over  years ago and still on the Amazon Best Seller List Negotiation category  WOW Probably the Bible alone was more popular And it is also true I checked that this book had influence on mostly Chinese and Japanese negotiation styles in the later part of the th century today  not really
with all due respect to Mr Tzu The Art of War is about  newsflash  how to battle your wars better as in REAL wars Tzu was a proclaimed Chinese General from the th century BC His book gives the best advice to the audience he intended it to be for combat Generals He addresses issues like how to seize a fortress or city
in that order The answer is that the book DOES give several tips that  IN SPIRIT  apply to negotiations For instance he discusses the importance of preliminary preparation before going out to battle remember
The Art of War is a great book for military strategy and tactics  as in West Point material In modern business
then the ancient Chinese might not fully know what to do in warfare But now this book as well as too many other books tells us only what to do
does not tell us how to do The issue of how to do is perhaps the most difficult point in any activity
The Giles translation of Sun Tzus classic is available for the Kindle as a free download Click here This is the Gutenberg Project publicdomain text
I agree that the translation can be a bit clumsy in places but if you overlook that you can fiind some real gems inside this unusual little book I love the relevance of so many of the concepts and every time I flick through I find a new lesson or a new way to apply the same lessons in a different context Only fight your battles after the victory has been won Loving it
There is a reason this book has survived for centuries One of the best strategy books ever written
and Sun Tzu describes perfectly how to win every battle
seems as this book lacks any logical order and as such offers nothing but a fuzzy,messy
Sun Tzu is poetic in his description of war tactics It is interesting that his tactics developed centuries  ago are applicable and relevant today Hence
an enlightened ruler is needful and a good general full of caution This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact
then read a book by Robert Greene Robert Greene is a great nonfiction author and makes history interesting by deriving from it the best behaviors to achieve specific objects
book was in great condition when it arrived to my home Love the book easy buy
I would have to say this book makes one of my top ten list as the best books of all time
This is a book of strategy for psychological warfareit helps you tackle the battles you face every day One of the biggest themes is how to win a fight before it actually starts If only our current government and military leaders had followed the wisdom of The Art of War
I feel ripped off the book is like  pages long  I could read that in an hour  That really isnt even fair to classify this as a book  A real book you dont even get into it until after  pages
This book is a classic  I bought and read this book out of curiosity  It seems to me some of our recent contemporary US commanders should have read this book before starting the Iraq war and taken its advise This book is filled with strategy regarding conflict  Some of the content is obviously way outdated
The Art of War seems to be a classic piece of Chinese philosophy that is easy to translate into a mediocre work  Ive read a number of translations of Sun Tzu that are clunky and have none of the wit of the original text  Now
but when a Chinese philisophical text reads like a manual for a microwave
you know something is lost in translation On the other hand
interesting introduction written by the translator which I found very helpful in thinking about the Art of War
This is a magnificent book that tells as much about psychology as it does military strategy
This will go down as one of the all time great works by the human race Excellent insight to the tactics in war and life This needs to be a mandatory reed for kids in high school
This book is required reading for anyone interested in military history Its very short
The content of the translations themselves was fine
but I found the formatting difficult to read The translator also interjects thoughts into the middle of sentences which disrupted the flow of the text even further Other versions may be fascinating
I have enjoyed the book  It has interesting ideas and concepts that I would have not understood about the warrior mind  It was helpful for my own research  I find it interesting that a current reality show uses this text for its show members
I expected a full length book
This is a magnificent book that tells as much about psychology as it does military strategy
the book isnt bad for a quick read to get the basic idea of Sun Tzus writings
One of those books everyone who works in a competitive environment needs to read You can apply the teachings of war to circumstances in the work place
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is an excellent book especially for those people who are in the military or law enforcement  The language of the book refers to ancient and not modern times  Based on my readings the author seems to be an aggressor
The Chinese had warfare figured out  years ago War has not changed enough since then to make this work irrelevant
Written by a military strategist in ancient China
This book is great If you have a enemy you want to take down or a solider about to go to battle
The books construct bored me However it does have insightful information
One of the greatest books on strategy ever written Need I say more
I only tried the sample on my Kindle Would have been a  loss since the text seems to be hardly edited and incomplete The layout on the Kindle is terrible Dontt buy this Shame on Amazon for trying to sell such a flawed product Id rather go for a free and complete edition by Project Gutenberg Or look for a different edition
better version Dont make the same mistake
My only complaint is that commentaries are interspersed within the text a bit disruptive  However it is free and Im glad to have it in my collection
trying to find the best Or at least the one with the best reviews but they all have the same reviews Word for word the same damn reviews Is this just people with too much time on their hands Could someone please leave a helpful review that hasnt been posted on every other version of the art of war
I seriously doubt anyone read every single version WTF PEOPLE
The Art of War is timeless information The rules are a plus in business and personal outlook I recommend it
Came in great time Russell Simmons has me thinking Vegan already only  chapter in I also watched his interviews about this book on YouTube before buying very intriguing
The greatest chinese strategist immortalized his ideas in this book about war strategies and tactics amazing books 
just like new Product was received in a timely fashion I am very pleased with the service i received Great job Kristin
incorrect chapter order
and apparently not full original text Dont know how Amazon allows this
but it is nearly impossible to read the Kindle edition I bought No spacing between the words
Not very interesting I did not like it Sunzi did a bad job writing this book Not made for kids or adults I hate it
This is a good reference guide for the teachings of Sun Tzu Straight and to the point
one of the chapters was out of order Im speculating that the publisher didnt know how to read roman numerals and therefore placed the chapter incorrectly
I ordered my normal size and probably couldnt have worn it if I lost  lbs
combative male psyche and primal need to dominate rather than cooperate which is still fostered and rewarded in business today It explains why women do not get ahead in business after countless years and many decades of demonstrated ability and superior management skills  The masters house will not be destroyed with the masters tools This book is a sad reflection on life
its hundreds of years old and in the public domain
Sun Tzus the art of war is one of the most overrated books in terms of content It is not that the writer is wrong about most subjects though a lot is hopelessly outdated The problem is that any  year old who has played with toy soldiers enough
relies more on logistics with the battles being just a small part of war So if you are completely ignorant of battles and war and simple logic you can read this book and be satisfied However if you are truely interested in the art of war then read the book with that same name from Machiavelli
Arrived quickly and in perfect condition  Great price
This is not the original writing Someones notes sold as real The cons of amazon ratings
some twenty odd pages  unfortunately the advertisement does not state this fact
Please notethis is not the full version of the book but a very heavily abridged version of approximately  pages in very large print To read from cover to cover takes about  minutes The seller does not make this clear In my opinion
The Art of War the book itself needs no further presentation by now as a beautiful example of the art of printing Very happy with the hardcover
Of course that is a classic I have to say that I feel a little uncomfortable with the concept of always thinking about winning the battle I can appreciate the benefits of mastering those principles for anyone engaging in battles politics
I prefer to engage with others thinking winwin I will certainly read that book a few more times this year and in the years to come As a classic
I didnt notice this was the chump change edition aka the abridged version I got it in hardcover as well Can you imagine a hardcover pamphlet  pages Its quite funny Not a total wast of money
but not what I was expecting as this information in not apparent in the item description
The kindle version has some formatting issues but forget about that The key here is that the rules of war are set very well In essence
they are unlikely to attack Such an interesting read with great examples from history Recommended reading
The Art of War is the surprisingly succinct classic of military literature attributed to Sun Tzu No one knows exactly when The Art of War was written but it was collected around the th Century CE Regardless of your interest in military strategy
this short collection of proverbs and idioms is worth the time it takes to read The lessons can be broad and universally applied to daily life
this book was great i am currently using some tactics learnt from within the book against a brand named pro rep they have a product which i would rather have received a bag of cow feces cow feces doesnt give cancer to children
but it doesnt get old The advice it contains is wise and can be applied to modernday life including the workplace It is not just a book about war and warfare
The quality is Brilliant and i will definitely recommend this to my family and friends to enjoy
in that it advocates diplomacy over conflict any day Very interesting indeed
this one feels far more substantial and the leather a bit thicker Sewn pages and thick binding make this feel great in the hands This edition is definitely my favourite choice of the Art of War
This edition is for children I guess  Its a reprint and the entire importance and it being an ancient manuscript is lost with its font and general print should always recheck the edition before purchasing
The formatting for this Kindle version is terrible and the academic narrative jumps from one thread to another
characters and time frames involved It really did not provide me with what I was after a clearly contextualized narrative of The Art of War Thankfully this purchase was cheap
In case youre expecting a thick tome
or a novel its basically a superthin
its riveting Each lesson makes you stop and think
Just as expected and well packed Arrived three days later than predicted but it is Black Friday week so not surprised Interesting treatise on strategy of war
Very interesting as to the mind of someone who seeks every possibility and prepares for every eventuality when war may ensue
I bought this expecting some large thickness paper back
but its only mm or so thick with a typeface more akin to infant school readers
Having heard about this work many times getting a copy has pleased me a lot you will understand that the work needs interpreing to your situation and this can be sales management planning  All the way to child care and relationships  people havent changed that much reading through you will find your boss  mates  partner  they are all there and laid bare possibly even you  cant recommend highly enough
this is a very brief book compared to the original one should be specified better in description as the text in description box references  chapters quite alot for a  page book I sent it back to get the full translated version
Short version of the book but worth the money
split into easy to read sections and although it was intended to provide strategies for success in battle there are people management techniques that apply today
a must have classics if your life goals are world domination This book set the base for modern EQ theories
but it does state the obvious Impressed that this was written so long ago and still have value
however I personally would not The book is too focused on actual battle and very high level tactics It would seem that many of the other similar but more targeted books in this category would do a better job for what I was looking for
Very good with good explanatory notes by the compiler
If youd like to gain some more insight into this famous book buy this Its a little straight forward more like bullet points than an instructive book worth the price
Inspiring read filled with lots of strategic advice
It might just help you in your day to day life to win your own wars in which we all fight each day The translation is loose but your mind gets used to it K RADNG numbers and letters together You get to grips with it
if only for the wisdom imparted for life  Readers should not contemplate war on reading this easy to read
This book is very easy to quote and has lessons that extend much father than the world of conflict This is a must read for everyone
Somewhat philosophical in places but an invaluable insight into the Chinese mind  Very interesting once you get through the heavy bits
As good as new Very good quality The translation is very good I liked it
totally worthwhile read just for the philosophy still valid today
It is a short book written by a successful Chinese general from thousands of years ago I finished it in just one day Even with its terse content
it is hard to summarize in a short blog post due to its diverse structure Each of its chapters provides bulletpoint lists of militarygrade advicegood advice no doubt
its a must read Definitely up there with the  books to read before you die
Good read Im not really someone that makes war and this was useful for me as well I found the chapter on laying plans particularly good
a good book broken down into good sized chapter for some great light reading it is good for those small journeys
Interesting to look at the knowledge and tactics used at such an early moment in history Worth reading if youre interested in early Chinese history
Very easy to read and thought provoking when dealing with politics within your business or personal life I have really enjoyed reading this book
Great A classic for any military student jh
Hugely insightful and full of common sense ideas that still translate into the modern world Would recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a quick think about strategy and leadership
Delivered in timely manner and good quality
Great read Teaches discipline could easily save your life having read this book
Interesting  Still relevant to modern warfare  N B  Blair  bush simple  but clear  worth a read thats all B
I always love this book there is nothing to doubt about the content absolutely almost the same like the hardcover version like i used to hve
Very informative book for military colleges and officer training schools explains how to become a military leader I recommend the book if you are curious about military runs
Have had a previous version and wanted to read it again Very applicable methodologies and techniques for the current business world
A good piece of classic literature that considering when it was written is still surprisingly relevant A few mistakes have been made in this translation nothing huge though
Reasonable price and fast delivery A very good read
This is a faithful adaptation of The Art Of War very readable and incredibly relevant even now This is one of those books everyone should read
work You can translate it all into success in business Excellently written and full to the brim of amazing references One I shall definitely keep revisiting
recommended for any body keen on deepening their understanding of basic principles
Good read in the main Liked it to dip in and out of randomly between other books Plenty to make you think
The printed MRP is  and I got it at  Delivery from Amazon was as usual good Now talking about the book I think its the most overated book that I have read so far  So my suggestion would be not to waste time on this It is written point wise that also for me seems a little childish It talks about different tactics of warfare which is completely irrelevant in todays time One atom bomb and all your Art of War would go in vain I though of giving it  stars but the reviews that is there on the cover of the book is so very good that it made me give it  star Also comparing it with Gita is complete insult to human civilization Rest I would say if you have a lot of time and want to waste it and get angry after few days then I would suggest you to go for this
deserving of its acclaim A must read for the contemporary master An echo of the past resonating true to the modern application of force and subterfuge
I know feel that I posess the tactical knowledge and the logistics of warfare to help me conquer my neighbouring province Heil Sun Tzu
Out of all the books involving philosophy this is the most interesting one
I was expecting as indicated in the free miniafter purchase version of the book
a conversion of the tales and events of Sun Tzu and his tact But was highly disappointd to see that this was nothing more than a bland version of do this Do that in a war scene Timely delivered Timely returned Dont understand why it has such high ratings
Its the nd Gita Quran  Bible Granth Sahib whatever is yours And if you want to be successful in any field then this book will fire up your mind But let me tell you one thing Its a book that basically gives you instructions
power on your creative mind and try relating each instruction to your everyday use I bet its going to be a brainstorming session and whats more Youll love it
When you start reading it it looks brilliant It appears Sun Tzu was brilliant strategist But these idiotic mental war fare and win a war without actually fighting it
just makes an army lazy This book is the reason for China losing almost every war after SUN TZU eralost from Mongols Europe divided China as a Mellon And lost from Japanese
Book looks and feels cheap but the translation is very good The choice of words is precise yet predictable and is neither archaic nor new age Each passage is translated in such a way to make the message directly accessible in English There are no footnotes which is something I wanted but there is a very good and lengthy introduction
Received the book in bad condition The front cover was crampled and there were dents over the cover and sides as well Quality was not adequate Moreover the book original price was INR  and not INR  as claimed This the discounts stated was also not correct
and well safe to say its full of gems Im not a very manipulative person by nature but have had many run ins over my short life span with people of this nature
which has very much contributed to myself being trod all over Reading this book really put into perspective many aspects of human behaviour and well quite frankly highlighted the characteristics of a narcissist and potential methods to counteract it There are many scenarios in the book which I dont see myself using however being new to the business world
take this book with a grain of salt and interpret it as you wish but regardless of the extent to which you relate to it  simply learning of the true essence of war makes it an interesting read nonetheless Also regarding the product  it is quite thin and condensed
and a book of this sort definitely needs annotation  but it did arrive fast and as pictured a steal for the price
concise and one seating read which can at max take  hours Insights are good but somehow translation seems off the target If you are familiar with war terminology and scenarios then definitely go for this book but if its your first book in the domain of strategy building and decision making then go for the book with explanation of each tactic given in simple language and analogy
many of these books are available on Amazon itself
and there is a very good reason for it  Written well over a thousand years ago Sun Tzus tactical guide to war is still used and taught in military schools
and it is reliable information  If you use a bit of thought then you can apply the teachings of Sun Tzu in your life
and those who want to be one step ahead of the game  Ultimately this is the classic for all
and hopefully can help you in unforeseen ways
The book is great and there are some amazing tactics that can be used in our everyday modern life However
few points are very contradicting to the actual meaning in the book Its a must read book but not worth the hype people have created  stars because of multiple contradictory sentences maybe the actual meaning could be lost in the translation Thanks to Amazon and the seller for quick delivery and reasonable pricing
This is probably one of the best versions of the Art of War ive seen anyway It basically gives some analysis and goes into depth on what Sun Tzu means
using some ancient Chinese commentators as references and examples to better explain the teachings I would have given this  stars but its layed out strangely Youll find pages with  sentence that seem continue on the next page
but its tolerable given the depth which the researcher explains things I have  different versions of the Art of War One is a thin  page pamphlet
the second has some artwork included but this version includes more than just Sun Tzus teachings on certain topics As a result its more enjoyable to read than a list of bulletpoints
I would like to thank Sun Tzu for giving the world a masterpiece to apply techniques that will give you success to achieve higher purpose in life Though this book is about war strategies Sun Tzu mentions war is not good for nation at large and we need to find out way to win without a fight Should we apply that to our lives we are mostly bogged down by little things that upsets us unnecessarily all we need to do is move ahead and move inch close to our vision each day
The book has been written in a clear and easy to understand bullet points format Each statement carries a weight to it and needs to be thought over before proceeding Highly recommended to those who are involved in any kind of competition
A great book but I thought initially about it would be a self help book but could not get to the point as expected but one can relate the points mentioned in the book with ones life when he or she tries to see life or simply challenges of life as just enemy otherwise the book is mainly focused on war stuffs like that of army and all
The kindle version of this book is absolutely unreadable So many OCR errors
I cant even come close to getting in to a flow counted  or so on a single page Even if free
Really great book Good book to learn about Strategy Simple and quick to read Strategies are written point wise
so it is easy to read and learn All the necessary strategies which are required to know
you can throw out all those contemporary books about management leadership  Book was a excellent condition  Brand new
Very glad I purchased this book Its actually  books in one Very good condition and a very attractive book One of my faves and a important book to have in your library Not only does it contain ,The Art of War
Excellent read I got to know about this book from the infamous movie Wall Street starring Michael Douglas as a charismatic business leader in which he quotes Sun Tzu Every battle is won even before it is fought A definite on must reads
This book by sun tzu teaches a lot about ancient warfare and is quiet interesting But it not only tells about that
it tells how to understand and control the actions of other The way to influence them and to use advantages efficiently It is a fun short book with a little bit of history and philosophy
easy on eyes Almost error free too so if you want to read this book can go for this print version
The work of Sun Tzu needs no endorsement  it is a timeless classic  This print itself is quite good  Its a small pocketbook with good paper and good printing  Priced very reasonably
A bit dated I bought this based on many reviews which said that its still relevant today I am not sure if I picked up the wrong translation but there are not many words of wisdom that I found which is applicable today
May be this books is amazing for people who are in defence services but i wasnt able to connect to it This book has war lessons in form of quotes and reading them feels like there is no link to those quotes and your life
This book is still the demograph for all armies today the fascinating ideal however is its use in day to day life the use of mentalism and not only knowing your enemy but also weighing up daily trials
The book contains Only tips and instructions You have to use your mind to understand it in modern context with your examples You need to think The quality of pages was good but the page color is yellow I bought the fingerprints publishing version
especially at this low price  I couldnt go wrong  Very interesting Very compact and complete  A book used through the ages  Most insightful
Even though this timeless piece is a dedicated guidebook to waging war
and understanding human nature  A great short read
This pocket book is great for a quick read The entire book is in the form of notes with bitesize pieces of information Quite an easy read
organisation of topics is also poor It feels boring to read and kills the interest of reader very quick Go for some other publication
San Tzu is really a genius who knows whos who of the war The art of war is a bundle of knowledge which is necessary in the contemporary world It is not only meant to deal a war but to deal with your day to day situations You will find an opportunity in every crisis after reading this book
This is a very good book Its recommended for reading in military academies all over the world But  years after it was written
it is a small book with great deal of knowledge if one can absorb the content well then heshe can easily surpass knowledge of present leadership books inmarket
This book is one of the real classic old time book which invokes the reader attention especially if one is interested in military
The content is great but the quality of paper couldve been better
An absolutely wonderful insight with a age defying knowledge A must read for people from all walks of professional life
With all due respect to the great author
English interpretation not up to the mark Not worth a read
Very disappointing for the price  The book is A and the cover is not the quality described  For  I expected something of higher quality  not a notebook equivalent
the timeless masterpiece of work and mind power to achieve success and a higher level of peace of mind this book is based on old strategies and methodologies which are timeless and can be implemented in present and future aswell highly recommended reading this SUN TZU  you genius warrior
awesome book quality pages
this translation is easy to understand In my opinion
as opposed to other translations out there where the contents of the chapters are poorly structured  are mixed along with some comments made by someone else
Its not even a book its look like a short notes for the actual book dont get fooled by the price
Its a little bit on tactics to win a war in ancient time I dont know if you can use it in todays time But nice and easy read It was cheap so I bought it
Ive redR the book which is must for indians keep inspiring all time and book is short simple like hand book cheap at its information Before waste in some other novels waste it for practically possible way
Doesnt look relevant in todays contexttranslation to english is also problem
Its just the plain translation of manuscriptonly  pages most of the verses as literally translated do not hold any meaning in English Worst  rupees ever spent Wish i can sue amazon for this stupid book Please please do not buyDue to this i have lost trust on online book buying
Waowreached one day earlier before delivery date thanks Amazon didnt expected wonderful and also product is in awosome condition light weight and good quality material and printingi recommend it go for it
Very good book to understand the todays world form this old theories
shorter than I expected but I am not sure if that is just the book or if this is just a short version
Just what it promised The art of war is still aplliacable to warfare as well as anything competitive Like in corporate ladder climbing
A Classic book about Military Warfare Thanks to Amazon and Fingerprint for the low price Nice large texts
Overly concise Avid readers may not like this compressed version
Its interesting that Sun Tzu understood human nature so well
Nice read Good ancient tricks n tips Not of much use in present form of combats But felt
but getting through the disagreement without the massive collateral damage that goes with conflict is a much undervalued approach Sun Tzu offers insightful advice to help master those anxieties
manage your resources towards peace of mind and to end disagreement in the most decisive and holistic manner possible so that life can return to its normal routine of tea and cake He may be cunning
the format of the book looks cheap and not being looked after
language is easy one can easily understand it
one of the best books written in history
Cover and paper quality is good The book is amazing
Really satisfied Fast delivery and great quality
Its too small and concise expected a better version of art of war
the quality of pages is abysmal Dont buy from this seller
Received    June    as  promised  In  new  condition  A  good  read
 it doesnt have deep explanations Thats left for the reader to interpret For the price
A must in todays competitive world
I am getting the old edition of the book ,so i returned This product is not shown on image
The content was not what I expected but the audiobook is of a high quality The reader does an excellent job
This book has multiple layers of meaning to it Read it thoroughly and try implying the strategies in real life
A nice book Even applies to the present world The topic of Spies is very nice one
Good to understand war techniques of ancient times Nothing or not much useful for modern timesOne time read for history buffs
paper quality is not good but everyone must read this book  So helpful
received in good condition
Book quality is good But it would be better If you bought the edition with explanations
It maybe ancient but a great artwork  philosophybattlecraft stratagemIts application means  blending them into modern  battle designswhichever quotes serves the purpose
In dire need for explanations Seriously this book is not for people who have less understanding power
This edition is worst Paper quality is too bad Quality and quantity is also too less Its only summary of the original book
content is good book  is thin and small quality is good price is very reasonable
Small book but quality content Must read
the book was in perfect condition and it was like guidelines written with minimum explanation worthy read if u can understand it 
Item as described Book in great condition with a couple of used book stickers which were easily removable Thumbs up
Delivered on time and in good condition it was slightly folded but nothing serious The book itself is in a point form
chapterwise It is comprehensive and to the point
not at all what i expected Not even a good translation
small in size but light when carrying Nice for everyday reading ,though the fonts size is a liitle smallGood for daily  contemplation
I was blown away by the simplicity of the thought process  Super simple and great for planning any attack or counterattack
A handy booklet for every reader
Amazing book and excellent delivery as usual from Amazon One stop solution for all the books 
Book came in very good condition Pages are good too
It is a very interesting view of peace and war Have not we learnt anything during the last  years
good print,font size is also reader friendly
I bought this book by considering the discount price but comes with thin and small book
No words to describe the amazing skills and mind of Sun Tzu He was a master and this his masterpiece
The very useful book to fight against the problem of life and how to perform our move against the enemy
Excillent Strategical guidlines simple presentation of military strategies
but as I have not read it personally it is difficult to give a better review
Not worthy for the money paid
excellent strategy book
Boring book Just like a notes of a special topic
Amazing read and awesome wisdom shared
The page quality is really bad Not worth the price I think its better to pick up from roadside stand than this copy
Great one in order to not get tired and still have something to read just to have filling of shall you still go for a heavier one
Great book in great condition for reasonable price
Its an easy edition everyone must read
Product quality is very poor Poor quality of pages
Just a quick reference guide
Extremely good book for the price the hardcover is amazing for the price
Not worth the money
One of the best books on strategic thinking However
the printing quality is cheap and can be improved a lot
Looks like some cheap translation from Chinese English is of poor quality
A simple Plain Translation Would have been happy if it had made the reader understand the meaning with an explanatory note
Old words of wisdom that still holds true in the modern world  Every work or project is like war
Very relevant even thousands of years later Helpful guidance dealing with daily challenges
Very good condition
being a teacher I find this volume the most essential text on pedagogy When I first started my campaign against unruly classroom behaviour I found that although I would win the occasional battle the overall war was being lost But now I command my room with absolute certainty getting to know my pupils and in the process of doing that I have come to know myself I need not fear the outcome of a thousand battles
Too complex not leading to a specific point
Book is in great condition Love it
Faulty translation and many errors resulting in an unreadable text no sources or introduction Theres a better version online for free
True content to the original piece of art Excellent theory to apply both in the past
Excellent paper quality and printing Very good book
its quite easy to follow and its split up very nicely into small chapters and the chapters are split into bullet points I found myself reading a chapter whenever I had a spare few minutes
Good read worth the price
Its a copy version of the original bookbasically summarizes in bad English the teachings or theories of sun tzuits not the real book as written by sun tzu
even in our modern age
This is a decent version of a classic text Its well laid out with a table of contents making it easy to dip in and out The ideas and strategies are individually explained in a couple of sentences
the timeless wisdom contained in this gem by Sun Tzu
has been utilised by many military and business menwomen for profitable advantage This Kindle version of
contains reliable insights and strategies that you can put to practical use in your daily life
readable format Colin G Smith
A must have book for all the book enthusiasts out there This edition is having the genuine translation by Sun Tzu without any interference editing by other authors I would recommend this book only as there as various editions available in the market Prompt delivery by Amazon and the quality of book is also top notch I would insist amazon to include bookmarks with all the orders of books made from their site
The title says it all A work in translation I suspect much has been lost in translation
so it may be dated now Im not sure as Im not a military person and so may not be the best person to review this book I thought it would apply to business Some very clever points in it
go ahead  purchase this book I promise that you wont be disappointed Hats off to Finger Print Publishers This is my third purchase with them after  The Three Musketeers   The Great Gatsby
And Im an happy customer  a huge fan Thank you so much guys My heartfelt gratitude
the points lack punch and not clear sense can be made out of the book I bought the book for  bucks which was a cool deal D
This book is a complete package for enhansing life skills Dissapointed that the selling price in amazon was more than the MRP tag on the back of the book cover its clearly written as Rs  but bought it for Rs  Overall its a useful product
I was given this book to read as part of my black belt preparation and u st admit that it is one of the hardest books I have ever read along with The Book of Five Rings I did not like the way this book was written as it it set out in short bullet point paragraphs
however I can understand why this book is still used in modern times as a lot of it can be adopted in other ways other than martial arts I am glad I read this book but the way it was written has made me award this book only  stars
and the pages have many weird
distracting ornaments on the sides I would recommend a different version of the book eg by Penguin This book is ideal for someone who just wished for a hardcover version of this text
and the book cover  stars for the great source material and the okayish cover
The book was delivered on time The quality of paperback is ok The book is filled with aphorisms related to war It would be difficult to imagine the entire meaning of the aphorism and relate it to the current times I would not recommend this version of the book to people who are looking forward to learn some incisive principles of challenges in life that are analogous to war
but lots of typos and amateurish layout Size is bigger than A size
Its all about strategy Be it war or rat race of the modern world
chatpers are point wise like in chaper  there are say  points likewise there are no paragraphs so there is limited explaination may be its the way original book is written  now this is both poistive as its succint with clearly stating the point but sometimes one seeks more explaination in depth to certain points Quality of book  its good at this price point  while i am being more demanding and want to have price lower than  because its thin book but knowledge in those pages may be worth more but i am looking from no of pages 
ink needed to print from that point of view it can be sold lesser than  also  comment i guess a commentary book or essay book on this book or critic book on this book needs to be read to gain the indepth meaning of the points discussed in book so that tactics used in the book can be used in other spheres  without actual war on land  final words must buy  read and gift 
Not what I had expected Print quality is poor as well as the content seems to be pirated
in case you plan to command a medieval army someday
great price
with  pages less from an unknown author I ordered for the book by Cleary Thomas and got a rubbish I ordered a mass market one but got a hardcovered one with CD but the author and ISBN is not written anywhere
Im sampling all the Kindle versions of the  Art of War to pick a readable translation Like buses that all seem to come at once
this is YET ANOTHER version of the Lionel Giles  version without the rather heavy original footnotes or the mildly useful Giles introduction Its actually in quite readable English for the date
and seems reasonably understandable in the st century Ive no idea on the accuracy of the translation Opening line from other Giles versions Sun Tzu said the art of war is of vital importance to the State It is a matter of life and death
AND I can always read the original introduction by getting a sample download from another version Simples
but will focus on the translation  This book is the first volume of a fourvolume translation  This review covers all four volumes Any translation of a literary work
is an exercise in compromise and cleverness  A particular sentence in Chineseeven a single phrasecan be rendered in numerous ways in English
which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader  That is the compromise  The cleverness comes in the insight and deftness with which the translator crafts and arranges those choices into a coherent whole It is said that one should always translate into ones A languagethat is
the language in which one is most fluent  But Dr Anthony Yu was a native Chinese speaker
and although years of teaching in the United States made him fluent in English
it was still not his primary language  It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this
that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped
and other cultural allusions for them to be adequately captured in a passing sentence  So Yus translation is copiously endnoted
and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place  Included also are scholarly citations that justify
with a degree of rigor that will probably be overlooked by the average reader
Yus study has even found errors in the original text The first volume of this translation adds an introduction that describes the textual history of this story
biographical sketches of the real people depicted in the novel
the way that he did  These additions admirably fill out the narrative and setting delivered to us so seamlessly by Yu  Other translations may have quainter charm or somewhat more fluid English
but this one provides such a complete perspective on the novel that it presents itself immediately as the de facto standard  A must have for the dedicated reader
The Journey to the West is a lengthy th century novel
regarded as one of the four great classics of Chinese literature The author of the book is uncertain
plus extensive notes and a ninetysixpage introduction by the translator
Anthony C Yu I found the introduction a difficult read
I often found it such The narrative is a fantastical retelling of Xuanzangs pilgrimage to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures
a pilgrimage that took place roughly a thousand years before The Journey to the West was written In the retelling
and a plethora of epic fights There is also a remarkably large amount of poetry
and it put me to sleep Reading the complete work is a labor of love for a scholarly person deeply interested in sixteenthcentury Chinese culture and its integration of Taoism
Buddhism and Confucianism The four hefty volumes offer a mythological and allegorical version of Xuanzangs journey to acquire scriptures in India Ordeals along the way illustrate the stages of spiritual transformation Xuanzang and his disciples are manifestations of the religious seeker Dealing with the ordeals reads a bit like a detective story Investigation reveals that the demons are often escapees from heaven According to my husband
the series is a fabulous exposition of Taoist internal alchemy and Chinese Buddhism
every few years for the last decade or so now Its wonderful
the Kindle version is a bit of a mess The Chinese characters are FAR too small to read theyre smaller than the smallestsize font
and some of the important concepts hinge on the characters used This needs to be fixed Id say
I am only halfway through this book and I love it  The story is so enticing that I dont want to put the book down  The introduction was very boring but helped in better understanding of the story and should not be skipped  Journey to the West is one of the top four books from China  This book is worthy of every bit of the reputation I have heard  My only regret is not having read this book earlier in lifeas the saying goesbetter late than never Recommended reading
I read the fourvolume revised Kindle edition of this book
translated by Anthony C Yu The story is the fictive rendition of a journey made by a th century Buddhist monk
nearly two decadelong pilgrimage in order to study Buddhism and acquire original Sanskrit texts of the religion from India When he returned to China
he translated many of the original texts to Chinese
thus leaving a decisive legacy on Chinese Buddhism Some of the pilgrims original scrolls are saved in a pagoda inside Xingijao Temple near todays Xian The story starts with the mystical events of a creature becoming the Handsome Monkey King Through various twists and turns
he acquires great skills and a variety of supernatural power which he will continue to use throughout the book Some mischievous acts in Heaven land him in trouble but upon the departure of Xuanzang  in the book also called the Tang Monk or Tripitaka after the Three Baskets of Buddhism that held the  original Buddhist scrolls  from the Emperors palace
the Monkey King is given the opportunity to become the disciple and protector of the Monk In the first phase of the long journey Tripitaka is granted two additional converted vicious monsters as his disciples Eight Rules who has the appearance of a pig and Sha Monk who has the look of a water buffalo To complete the mystical traveling company
a water monster is enforced to serve as the replacement of Tripitakas deceased horse The bulk of the story is the description of the groups arduous traveling through impenetrable forests
and fiends who invariably want to devour the guiltless Tripitaka This enhanced interest in the Tang Monk as a culinary delight roots from his purity that is thought to guarantee extremely long life to the cannibalistic food connoisseurs With his boundless ingenuity and smarts the Monkey King leads the three disciples to defend the Monk For the contemporary reader
not the least of which is the length of almost  pages In the book one will find numerous repetitions where the four main heroes tend to recite some of their earlier adventures in various situations when they meet new characters The reader is already fully aware of these events and they tend to slow down the flow of the story One can skip these paragraphs however
without losing much from the narration For some readers another obstacle could be the numerous poems and songs throughout the book In my rough estimation  of the text may well be poetry The poems are enjoyable and usually provide finer details of
the main story As such
they are more functionally part of the book then in another classic pillar of ancient Chinese literature
the poetry in the Dreams of the Red Mansion In that book the poems and songs are highly transcendent with the purpose of providing insight into the characters inner selves I skimmed through many
but not all poems Others may decide to skip the poems altogether but those who decide to read them in even greater details
will experience an enhanced overall literary beauty of the book Of the four characters
the Monkey King is by far the best portrayed one and the main reason I gave not  but  stars to this book He is an absolute riot a perfect timeless embodiment of a bad guy turned good who has a curiously complex psyche with a mixture of selfadoration
a great sense of humor Typical of him is the name he has chosen to himself early in the story The Great Sage Equal to Heaven Among all the fictive characters I have encountered in my readings
the Monkey King has become one of my all time favorites for his colorful and likeable temperament and for the exquisite perfection with which he has been portrayed Although the Tang Monk is formally the leadhero of the story
spiritually pure individual imaginable who is singularly driven by his unshakable convictions and principled Buddhist mind Unfortunately
he is also gullible to the point of annoyance and this brings a copious amount of trouble to the poor Monkey King Eight Rules is a secondary character whose personality is also drawn with an expert pen He is stupid
yet quite capable in many ways His loyalty to the Monk never feels solidified
however he seems to function perfectly well under the critical tutelage of the Monkey King and the exculpation of the highminded Tripitaka The character of the third disciple
is far less complete than the previous three and doesnt deserve particular attention in this review Overall
the book in its full length is not an easy read I recommend it mostly to those tickled by a potential glimpse into the spirituality of an ancient world
namely the late Ming Dynasty What a rare privilege to enjoy such a treasure An abridged English translation is also available for those curious readers with a more tepid interest Additional information The book has served as inspiration for multiple movies
in no way should be considered a faithful presentation of the original story Ive also read the Ultimate Journey Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment
moderntime perspective to this ancient story
For anyone into Chinese culture and Eastern  spirituality  This is a tale which I believe is nonfiction like everything else including the leprechaun where you can compare yourself to the main character Sun Wukong and evolve with it
see yourself as a forever evolving leader This monkey was not always godly but after learning lessons through pain you see the evolution of his character This journey has many subcharacters too and I recommend you read this with patience and excitement both Its a good laugh
Very interesting story  The intro was as well
but educational The book came in good condition
A great translation
perfect for beginners just learning the story of the monkey king or for advanced students who want to study the text in more detail This book helped me learn about the role Taoism and Buddhism in ancient Chinese culture
Having read Waleys abridged edition Monkey
a good amount of these opening chapters were familiar  Nonetheless
Yus translation reads differently enough and the complete series of events is captivating enough
that I had no desire to skip straight to Volume   I wish I had had the good sense to just read a complete translation the first time  I even find Tripitaka ever so slightly less awful thanks to Yus introduction which offers some historical background I thoroughly enjoyed the volume
The book contains a lot of helpful footnotes explaining some of the lesser known cultural references The story itself takes a lot of time to get going
I bought this for myself after watching some interesting videos about the journey to the west I am super excited to read it and learn more My only dislike so far is that the package came bent in a corner and caused a bend in the book corner too
and reading the actual story wrote in the  century is an Awesome experience The introduction is a lil long but necessary to understand all the history and allegories that the story has
Buddhism  Confucianism So isnt a children story as a lot of people used to see itbut a a TRUE literary work
i read an english abridged version of the journey to the west it enjoyed it
when i found out that a full unabridged english translation of it had been completed and available to purchase this year  I bought all four volumes of this immediately on my kindle and I felt so great having the complete novel on my kindle
who i read spent  years translating this novel  I am so thankful  Thank you Mr Yu And thank you Wu Chen En for writing this marvellous tale all those centuries ago
This is a very readable translation of the Chinese classic
much better than a translation I attempted several years ago Not knowing Mandarin
Great edition of this classic book
I have many translations of this Chinese classic
as well as the original Chinese version  If you want a real feel for this story
you cannot go wrong with this version  Yes
This is a quite stilted professors translation of a classic work of literature I cant read the original
and I regret the purchase I find it unreadable The good doctor is to be commended for his exhausting effort to translate the entire work
which Waley did not undertake But Yu has merely a good students grasp of English
and writing literary English is beyond his powers
The best English translation ive ever found This masterpiece contains a lot of meaningful cultivation practice principles Totally worth reading
I always get pulled in the beautiful world of this fairy tale legend Highly recommended
engaging story Good read for fantasy and mythology fans In some parts language is a bit archaic but overall very good Just started Volume 
the critical introduction is what makes this issue valuable
Great happy with product and service
I read this translation together with the Chinese original
the authoritative Renmin Wenxue Chuban Se edition third edition
the translation lacks a little of the brio and fun found in Waleys highly abridged Monkey Yus somewhat slavish adherence to the original text yields dividends
yet at the same time sacrifices a bit of the verve I found myself preferring to read the Chinese despite it being more difficult a feature of the somewhat abstruse vocabulary Another point to note is that the original writer has a very wide vocabulary
which isnt that noticeable in Yus translation he tends to tone down some of the more difficult words Nonetheless
Yus version must remain the best translation of Journey to the West
though I wont say its definitive like Moss Roberts Three Kingdoms version for Sanguo Yanyi What is really splendid about this edition is a lengthy and scholarly introduction which helps lay readers understand the Daoist and textual background of Xiyouji
Years ago I spent twoandahalf years reading this and the other three volumes of this novel aloud as a bed time story to a lover who had listed it as her next birthday present At the end of close to 
Im never going to have to read another novel because nothing out there now will ever touch this work of art After perhaps an year novel reading hiatus I picked up the habit again
I really dont know if it is worth the time and money Over time those volumes slipped away as onceread books tend to do and so I bought this
just to keep them close and occasionally read a chapter or two at bed time to my wife
The book cannot be enjoyed without the reader having a basic exposure to Chinese culture and history
great is it awesome it is cool it is good it is very great book it is very much great job i like super much best book ive ever read
its deeply popular in asian culture Ive seen  different tv shows about it If I had read this book before watching those shows
I wouldve thought Journey to the West was awful The translation is extremely dry I think it wouldve been better if the author took liberties and wrote the story himself rather than do a direct translation If you are really interested in this story
Reading Journey to the West is a fairly mammoth task It is long Ive seen the statistic that it is twice the length of Tolstoys War and Peace Be prepared to navigate your way through the tricky to translate metaphors in the poems
characters who use a wide variety of names and a narrative structure unlike anything a present day Western reader is expecting Also be prepared to discover endearing characters
beautiful word use and a sense of humour and fun that defies time and cultural divides
accessible and beautifully written translation by Anthony Yu When I wasnt too engrossed in the story
the footnotes at the back provided an excellent explanation of what various turns or phrase refer to and lead me to learn so much about Chinese mythology and history While I expected that it would be a long slog to get through the first volume
Very good edition
A good introduction to the Chinese classics
this book is so good Im definitely going to e getting volume 
This was probably the most difficult read of the year for me Just getting through the introduction
If you like a bit of Monkey madness Arthur Waley translation and want to understand better the religion
history and philosophy underlying the original Journey to the West and Chinese religion in general then this is the book for you A really enjoyable translation with lots of footnotes for those interested Oh and still plenty of laughs If the Chinese stare at you when you start laughing out loud just say XiYouJi and it will be laughs all round The kindle version was very easy to navigate
its just amazing Beautiful poems
This is the second volume of Anthony C Yus fourvolume translation of the Chinese classic
and a generous helping of poetry The narrative is episodic and repetitive
but was often tempted into more Although there is a great deal of violence
I didnt expect a Chinese classic to contain a scene where three of the heroes pass off their piss as holy water A radical concept literature is allowed to be fun
This is a classic series of stories that every child in China knows  The characters are very popular  I can now understand some comments made by Chinese speakers and TV news commentators that make allusions to this classic  This is one of the four volumes translated by the author  The books are heavily footnoted and suitable for serious study by English speaking persons interested in Chinese culture  The main issue I have with the series of books is that there is a lot of repetitionbased on how the stories were told over the ages  A minor issue is that many footnotes refer to other volumesbut the Kindle edition does not give an immediate link to the other volumes
phrases to western readers The Bad Deus ex machina resolutions
the incidents are somewhat repetitious Yus translation is an easy and enjoyable read  On to Volume 
A must read book for all avid readers around the world  Brought the whole series from this authors since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West  It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me
I wanted to read the other  JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book  of JW  Amazing story telling
I have many translations of this Chinese classic
as well as the original Chinese version  If you want a real feel for this story
you cannot go wrong with this version  Yes
This is part two of one of the four great written masterpieces of China
the closest English speakers will get to the original Chinese text  Occasional awkwardness of wording in the translation is unavoidable as this work has gone from its original to a greatly contrasting culture Do not let this discourage you as you read
they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book  I recommend this
to anyone interested in the culture
This translation of the classic novel respects every single detail like the poetry on it
what makes this worth the money is the references and context notes by the translator
One of the greatest stories ever written in the category of fantasy fiction  Highly recommended
This translation of Journey to the West is awesome  Ill admit that I havent read other translations
they say it is a great translation of the book
This is a great story not just this volume
I really recommend these books to be read by anyone it has everything that a great great story need Prepare yourself for a great journeyread the story
Great happy with product and service
I could hardly put it down  The subtle comedy and the continuos action is perfect for anyone above  years old  I LOVED it
this book and other volumes is a must As this is considered a very good translation of the original
a curious reader or even a Dragon Ball fan
This is the second entry in the  books and is equally interesting Same as the first one some poems are just amazing and beautiful and lovely And of course the story goes on
I hope the translation ist ok
but I knew I was dizzy with love for this th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown
dizzying is the best word for this wonderful book The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest
and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life Its all sofascinating It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I havent been in a long
to be honest The story just saunters and putters around Even the central love triangle between Daiyu
What can I say about Story of the Stone that hasnt already been said It is truly one of the greatest masterpieces of world literature and I have spent nearly twenty years of my life reading and studying this incredible book
it should be said that David Hawkes translation of the first three volumes if exceptional While I dont agree with every decision he made as a translator
he always had a reasonable explanation Ive also seen his translators notes
which is available in book form from the Chinese University of Hong Kong Press or available online for free For example
and he makes a very good case for it What makes this translation truly exceptional and the reason it is so much better than the English translation by Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang is because it can stand on its own as a work of literary art Hawkes masterful prose makes the reader feel like the book was originally written in English despite the content letting you know that its a very different world because of how smooth and stylish it is He is able to not only convey the words
especially with something so complex as Story of the Stone He took some liberties with the translations of some of the poems of which there is a lot in this novel
but they flowed naturally in English while still retaining
not to mention his ability to handle nearly yearold Chinese humor and playfulness of word games and subtle foreshadowings David Hawkes is clearly one of the most exceptional if not THE most exceptional translator of Chinese literature into English that I have ever encountered His Introduction in Volume I is also one of the best overviews of the novel ever written Of course
translation aside
ability to engender so many different and genuine feelings in the reader
all of the ups and downs It could be said that Cao Xueqin writes like a painter His insane attention to detail and description makes the reader feel like they are really there
you have to read it at least five times I would also strongly suggest that those who fall in love with this novel
spend some time looking for other scholarly books and articles related to the novel
and you may even find a greater sense of closure particularly if you dont read the last two volumes
not written by the original author of the first  chapters
This story in Volume one revolves around several upper class families and shows the high level of etiquette required among family members  The English translation is seamless and becomes beautiful in the way poetic couplets of two or more lines are presented One meaning of the book is that it is a remembrance of the past This seems to refer to the lives of various princely families in Nangking during the early th century before they were punished by the Emperor The Chinese author was a member of these families The original in Chinese was printed in January of  and has become one of the most famous pieces of Chinese  literature A knowledge of Chinese culture and history would no doubt increase the readers appreciation for the quality of this book
Thisthe whole volume setremains Chinas greatest novel
and possibly the greatest novel in any language  It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China Red Studies
however   Im currently reading it for the rd time I have also read the abridged translations
and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader at least
Caos characters are sometimes quirky
and always individuals and characters This is of course a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature   The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do
and identify Caos characters with people they know Cultural psychologists take note   First is the stunning level of social commentary here
but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation  Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women including being corrupted into notsogood women   Cao was humorous and gently ironic  The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Baoyu survives largely because of his infinitely caring
alwaysthere maid and lover Aroma  Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses   Nobody in the Englishlanguage literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement  The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin  Cao would probably have known their work  They had the same socially critical stance  They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women
American readers  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers you know they have servants yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff  Cao is way ahead   Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal
open writing about love that Cao managed so well  There is a wonderful translation of one of Zhengs more painful and personal love poems in V McHugh and C Kwock
Europe it might be a chore to get interested in this book The pace seems to be a little slow but that is because the details of daily life in China days past are different and they might just slip right past you If youre interested in how life was lived in that part of the world
it is a riveting and interesting read Especially useful for someone who is keen to have a better understanding of Chinese culture and literature Highly recommended
One of the masterpieces of Chinese literature  Five volumes and hundreds of characters Has a modern feel
despite being more than two hundred years old Fascinating book
Rank and privilege in th century China The family compound Relation between relatives and the pecking order The state loses meaning at extended family level which tend to have their own laws and customs Subjection of women is rife
but not without protest This book about customs is worth more than a history book in order to understand how people lived  This is not a history book
Have not completed the book Great introduction Four stars just because the translation cant express the exact details and feelings from the original Chinese version
This book is one of the celebrated classics in Chinese literature The English translation here is very good Even the poetry is well done
The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone
but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me Until I read Cao Xueqin
I had no interest in China or chinese literature These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the th century I have spent the last year reading everything I can find from  and back
and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman
this is kind of unusual I think Although the main character is a young male
the books are primarily about the women
the books have layers of reality and dream Truth and fiction There is double meanings in almost everything I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer And David HawkesJohn Minford are the cats meow for translators  I find Pinyon names much easier to read
Excellent novel with great view of the Chinese culture of the time
but that didnt prevent me from thoroughly enjoying it  Its hard to keep track of who the characters are  I read it on Kindle
and only at the end did I see there was a key to the characters
Ive read  our  translations of this classic novel and this is by far the best Ive reread it about  times Its like travelling in time and space for a vacation with extraordinarily interesting people of a different culture
great translation 
I am not sure what to say about this book after reading only one volume It is an exquisite blend of history
riddle and of course Chinese philosophical witticisms There are more than  characters in The Story of the Stone and many with very similar names You must get familiar with at least  of these characters because they are not bit players The plots are intricate but not particularly hard to follow and the pace of reading is quite brisk and easily understandable That in itself is an accomplishment since the story takes place in China around  years ago and revolves around lifestyles and customs that I would imagine that most Westerners are unfamiliar with I actually read a review where someone compared this book with Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann I dont know about that
and the character listing with description are well worth it  Other translations are incomprehensible
I loved this classic novel  There are extravagant descriptions of the unbelievably lavish lifestyles of those favored by the emperor
This book is first of a five volume English translation of a Chinese classic
and the setting of the story is early in the th century This book was selected by Great Books KC group as our exposure to nonwestern literature for the year  At the time Dream of the Red Chamber was selected for our schedule we didnt realize how long the complete work is The Story of the Stone 
pages of actual core text not including Prefaces
Our group decided to limit our discussion to the first volume as a more manageable reading assignment I have no intention of completing the other four volumes any time in the foreseeable future Its my understanding that the complete story is about the beginning grandeur and eventual decline of the aristocratic Jia family clan As indicated by its title
this first volume is focused on the beginning prosperous years The book provides a detailed insight into wealthy Chinese cultural life of the time and the storys narrative includes frequent use of poetry But this novel lays out a sprawling story line with numerous characters with names impossible for western readers to remember or pronounce This is combined with excruciating details which at times can be beautiful
but overall becomes a heavy forest of words for the reader to slog through Frankly
David Hawkes English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far Item arrived in reasonable condition
but I hope she will get the following volumes too I myself have enjoyed this book in the original Chinese edition and have loved it since I first read it Highly recommend
It is a terrible translation  Only buy it if you must
A great novel
the price is good too
This particular version and translation of the novel is very enjoyable I find it hard to understand since i bought this book for a college Asian literature class
the condition of the book i received was new and I was very happy about that
It is fantastic As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a  understanding of the Chinese culture and history I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel
Not too much to say Dream is amazing and Ill leave my commentary on the actual novel itself there David Hawkes did a good job
but his translation is lacking in many ways Dream is full of puns and other languagecharacter specific nuances Much of the deep irony and symbolism is lost in limp and at times flippant name translations and confusing reproductions of titles that can easily leave the reader scratching their head His choice to translate from a combination of texts provides perhaps too many opportunities for translating to become editing and revision Still a good buy if you have no investment in Dream as anything but a cool novel someone told you about
it would be best to at least have a Chinese version at hand for comparison
The Story of the Stone is an absolutely delightful tale I only wish I could secure volume  since there is so much anticipation at the end of volume  The translation is musical and the appearance of the book itself is lovely
This is a contemporary account of life in thcentury China  The author is a very intelligent observer of daytoday life in that time  As he goes through his daily routine he encounters eunuchs
which he accepts as facts of life  The days when these manifestations of the human condition would be viewed with horror seem far away  This book would be of great interest to students of history
If you are going to buy this book make sure you get Vol  as well Or it would be better to buy another book that has the complete story 
as most of the reviewers seem to be  My only experiences with Chinese literature heretofore are Ezra Pounds translations of poets such as LiPo and other much older poets from the Tang Dynasty period  Thus
my approach to the book has consisted of that of a lover of Western literature dipping his toe into what all seem to regard as THE masterpiece of Asian literature  Im sorry if my review disappoints or rankles the devotees of this book  On the other hand
it was my experience in reading this first volume and the review remains truthful to it First
I actually found his Introduction much more interesting than the book as a whole  He goes well out of his way in both the Introduction and the Appendix to make things as easy on the English reader as possible  Nevertheless
being a native of England and a lover of its literature
or whoever wrote the first chapter as this seems to be in scholarly dispute anticipates my reaction to the book
from which I quote in part I do not claim that they are better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time I am only saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more effective antidote to boredom and melancholy On the other hand
limpid quality to the characters and the setting  There are even some pearls amidst the paste in the translated poetry
such as In vain we roam Each in the end must call a strange land home Or Heaped charnelbones none can identify Were golden boys and girls in days gone by But
granted but its still mere milieu I am full willing to grant that I may be missing something due to translation
how this work can be considered great literature
I was involuntarily compelled to read an abbreviated translation of this novel Dream of the Red Chamber I remember how surprised I was to find that I enjoyed the experience Life went on
it struck me that a reread might speed me back to health How lucky I was to have stumbled on this fivevolume miracle of a translation
which is just worlds and galaxies and universes richer than that first version Id readand a whole lot longer
too Ive laughed and cried and puzzled and wondered my way through it many times since over the intervening  years Reading it is an immersive experience on so many levels
and I am always amazed at how fully the author realizes his characters
some of whom are capable of making me admire them on one page
and yet still love them as human beings whose motivations Ive come to understand intimately Only a very few of the worlds greatest authors can render their characters in such glorious complexity
Cao Xueqin is one of them The author is as charismatic as they come If youre not yet a fan of Buddhist poetry
youre going to drop that prejudice somewhere toward the end of Volume  And if you think its silly to cry buckets at the end of a novel
This review applies to the first three volumes of this story This is a typical Chinese fable  involving hundreds of characters It follows the growth and interactions of a large well to do family and its branches This in itself makes it difficult to keep track of each one but it is made even more difficult because each character is referred to by more than one name Their given name
their relationship name  Auntie Xue and their nickname Aside from that the storyline is rather mundane and does not move along at a satisfying pace But the biggest complaint is the translation
I have read other Chinese fables and have found them a satisfying read however this translator seems to have written his own tale And it is done more as an English Victorian tale in words and phrases rather than a Chinese fableAnd in his lengthy introductions he admits he has taken liberties with the earlier manuscripts and translations His language is not at all reminiscent of other Chinese translations in use of words or idioms  While there are more volumes left to read I will not go beyond the first 
This book is probably the best translation from Chinese into English The choice of archaic English words and phrases preserves the tone and style of the original Classical Chinese texts Even the poems when translated into English are rhythmic The translator has a profound knowledge of Chinese culture
subtle feelings within characters are stunningly preserved The main character Baoyu and Daiyu jumps out in front of you
This magical novel portrays a traditional society turned upside down a boy whod rather be a girl
where realitys as hard as rock but stones can talk the authors interesting philosophy is presented with admirable wit and humility
and scandalous Yet sophisticated readers will marvel at Caos expressive art and soaring lyricismand David Hawkess English translation is superb in its life and immediacy The protagonist Baoyus object of desire
and the volatile relationship between them is beautifully rendered Born with a shimmering piece of jade in his mouth
I spend a lot of time wandering through bookstores  One particular book has caught my eye over the years
and the other day I bought it  Volume  of Cao Xueqins eighteenth century epic
this is wholly unlike anything Ive read from the era  It bears structural similarities to the Laurence Sternes Tristram Shandy and Sentimental Journey
Caos attention to actual life experiences
along with frank dealings with human relationships and sexuality makes The Golden Days much more than any quick summary of style or content can relate The Golden Days begins in amusing
this stone has magical properties
which is also selected for incarnation by the Fairy Disenchantment  The stone and the flower are incarnated as the novel begins in earnest
are the centerpieces of the novels action  Like the big house fiction of the English eighteenth century
and servants mingle and interact constantly  Cao marks himself as a remarkable author by the way he handles a massive cast of characters
as well as the forms of etiquette that determine their relationships  Another terrific facet of the novels construction is the almost stream of consciousness style Cao employs  as characters pass in and out of the immediate action of the novel
the narrative seems to choose the person its most interested in and follow them for pages at a time
making historical China accessible to even st century readers  he reduces people to their human concerns Cao Xueqins novel is also remarkable for what I can only call its protofeminist tone  While we are reminded by certain characters that male lineage is of major importance to the structure of the society
the narrative consistently shows the power
says he is more comfortable around women  that they are like water
unclean  One of the main characters of this volume is Wang Xifeng
is quite obvious and important to the novel If you are like me
and know tragically little about Chinese literature and culture
Cao takes care of that too  there is a heavy emphasis throughout the novel on the cultural productions of China  The book integrates a wide range of poetry
and mythology as a central part of Baoyu and Daiyus upbringing  One can sense Caos insistence in the novel that education and cultural production is of vital importance
The Story of the Stone is an impressive and fascinating tale that incorporates otherworldly magic and mysticism with the saga of wealthy Jia family  The fivevolume story chronicles the familys highliving glory days through their bitter decline
all the while immersing the reader in rich details of daily life in th century China  I completely agree with the following quote from the Times Higher Educational Supplement an astonishing book  It recreates a world that would otherwise be utterly lost  Anyone even mildly interested in Chinese history and culture will be enthralled by this glimpse into the privileged world of wealthy th century Chinese Author Cao Xueqin was truly a creative genius  Story of the Stone is multifaceted
and superbly crafted While reading the first chapter of the first book Dream of the Red Chamber
I was struck with how utterly clever and imaginative the story is  You will instantly be aware that you are reading something that has endured almost three hundred years for a very good reason  The story is populated with dozens of wonderfully threedimensional characters  many of whom are woven in and out of the story making for a most interesting read  Most notable is the spoiled and curiously effeminate protagonist Jia Baoyu
magical item that I wont reveal here dont want to spoil your enjoyment of the book All of the elements that make traditional Chinese literature such a joy to read are embodied in Story of the Stone  Elaborate settings
and traditional symbolism with a healthy dose of humor and bawdiness create a beautiful and riveting story that will keep you wanting more  I highly recommend reading the entire book series  It is impressive that a work can stand the test of time as well as Story of the Stone has David Hawkes fine translation is excellent  Although some have criticized him for using too much slang
I feel that his translation is effective in expressing the characters true sentiments
in my opinion anyway David Hawkes has done an amazing job translating this brilliant thcentury novel into colloquial modern English I have read all the translations this is my favorite novel
and this is by far the best version for an English speaker who just wants a good book I can imagine that a Chinese reader could pick holes in this translation
as I could nitpick at a translation of Shakespeare the wealth of the original is impossible to transfer whole into another language and culture If you want a wordforword translation so you can use this as a study guide while you read the Chinese
maybe the wooden Beijing Languages version could help you But I have a hard time imagining any new translation being more vivid and fun to read than this one Yes
it is littered with sometimes annoying Britishisms That is the price of a colloquial translation Its true that Hawkes does not explain all the references that would be another book in itself  And I am sure he made mistakes I help a French translator occasionally and even though he is very wellversed in English
it is so easy for him to miss something that only a cultured native speaker could pick up But this translation is ALIVE Until that perfect translation comes along one day
The Dream of the Red Chamber The Story of the Stone starts off as an immensely long inscription on a miraculous stone which was copied out by a visiting man and taken down into the world for publication Volume  gives the account of the magic stones origin
mystical overtone Once upon a time a piece of stone that was unworthy to be used for repairing the sky possessed magic power and ended up in the mortal world The unhappy stone incarnated and lived out the life of a man before finally attaining nirvana and returning to what Buddhist refers as the other shore Jai Baoyu is the incarnation of the stone The name baoyu means treasured jewel and was named after the wonderful incident that the only surviving son of the Jia household was born with a piece of spotless jade in his mouth Lin Daiyu
which the unhappy stone once conceived a fancy that he took to watering everyday so the flower was able to shed the form of a plant and became a girl The consciousness that she owed the stone ensued her to repay him with the tears shed during the whole of a mortal lifetime if they were ever to be reborn as humans in the world beneath It was no wonder when Daiyu first saw her cousin
the first volume of The Dream of the Red Chamber depicts a fairly eventual record of a great Manchu household Qing Dynasty under the tutelage of the Imperial family in early th century China Its the picture of daily routines in the life that emerge most vividly from its discourse The Jia household is genuinely disguised as some highborn aristocrats whose ancestors were ennobled for their military powers This first installment of five parts
when they were still nested in the protecting shadow of the ancestors and the readily accessible wealth The familys decline and fall constitute the general background of the novel With over  characters
and even murder constitute to the pages of this Chinese epic that evokes Remembrance of Things Past and One Hundred Years of Solitude The heart of the novel is the predestined relationship between a semiethereal entity and magic stone under the context of the Buddhist understanding that earthly existence is an illusion This meeting
he could scarcely make out of what he saw Nature might have endowed him an eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton How does one expect a yearold scholars deem him to be  throughout most of the book to recognize and seize his destiny The fairy showed him not only his life cycle but also the romantic passions
heartbreaks of duststained human world Baoyu was destined to mingle with girls around him The ancestors thought Baoyu had inherited a perverse
intractable nature that rendered him eccentric and emotionally unstable Exposure to the worldly illusions of decay might hopefully succeed in enlightening
and transforming him Daiyu seems to know Baoyu more thoroughly than anyone does She is able to nail his problem despite her occasional tiff with him over trivial matters Baoyu always complained about peoples getting angry with whatever he did
and verses in the novel hint at his friendlessness in the mortal world and the incessant debate over the depth of his relation with Daiyu The roaming back and forth
sink and soar between sorrow and elation between the two incarnated cousins constitute to the understanding that earthly existence is indeed a transience but karma determines the shape of ones life and the life after This idea of life being a dream from which one eventually awakes is a Buddhist tenet
but the incorporation of it into the novel becomes a poetic gesture to demonstrate that the main character Baoyu is indicative to the author The Dream of the Red Chamber in Chinese has the connotation of being rich and grand The title can refer to a dream of the vanished splendor and opulence The frequent use of dream imagery implies the possibility that the luxurious world of the authors youth
had vanished so utterly at the time of writing The story of the Jias closely accorded with fortunes of Caos own family
which attained its height under the reign of Kangxi But the exact relationship existing between characters of the novel and members of Cao family is uncertain and discreet Baoyu is assured to be authors selfportrait
whose struggle towards emotional maturity was delineated with an affluence of nuance Other characters could be compsite of several family members over different generations for the purpose of disguising facts
Im surprised that I had never heard of this novel until recently Covering five volumes and over 
it was written in the eighteenth century and depicts the life of the aristocracy in ancient China  The first volume introduces us to many characters
I found it quite easy to submerge myself in the story  Perhaps the translation is to be credited
because although the tale is set over  years ago
I never felt as though the characters were anything but recognizably human  I intend to read the remaining four volumes  Quite absorbing and unique
I just finished a class devoted to the study of The Story of the Stone aka Honglou Meng
Dream of the Red Chamber and feel completely awed by the complexity and skill of Cao Xueqin This novel thoughtfully and naturally weaves together several timeless human themes If you enjoy literature which requires analysis at several different levels simultaneously
youll love this book Two notes for those who dont speak Chinese Learning the characters names is difficult even for those with a background in Chinese
but the translator does do readers a favor by translating servants names into English equivalentsapproximations while leaving the names of the main family members in romanized Chinese Keep in mind that two of the most important families are named Jia and Zhen
genuine respectively This is just one of many iinteresting and meaningful messages inevitably lost in translation Also
its interesting to compare the ways Gao changes the story
the set is a marvelous translation of a great classic The Story of the Stone is a novel that should be included in any true curriculum of the great books There are sequences that are emotionally moving and powerful This is the most complete translation in English I am aware of
be prepared to read the other four volumes The story is difficult to begin with
but because of the complexity of Chinese names for the western reader The book is  provided with a useful list of characters for each volume
all becomes  clearer for the remainder of the book The story itself is a fascinating  picture of life in th century China
and portrays the development of a  young boy who has otherworldly origins The western reader needs to view  dispassionately the Buddhist theme which pervades the novel
the philosophy underlying the novel is both charming and  practical in its own way I found the book addictive
it forms a wonderful introduction to classical Chinese  literature
and those similarly addicted will find it leads into many other  books of Chinese prose and poetry
Story provides an engaging peek into the lives of an upperclass family in feudal China The story takes a little patience at the beginning due to the large number of characters But the reader will soon realise that how the characters are related to one another is not crucial to appreciating the book Rather
come to feel for the characters in no time and look forward to finding out how their lives evolved in the later four volumes David Hawkes translation cannot be faulted The writing flows easily and the flavour of the allegories and poetry are
 A NonChinese reader should beware of the fact that no matter how good Dream of Red Chamber is translated into English
to the degree that author is capable to densify and enliven a whole paragraph in English into several sentences I will take some examples later  Cao was born from a noble family
thus the gamut of knowledge and references cause huge problems not only for Western Scholars which are very few
but also Eastern StoneScholars  The vissicitude of Caos family is unimaginable to a modern reader
emotion and situation in which the author wrote this book render more subtlety than modern readers can fathom and writers alike to apply  Too many puns
word plays and moods of Chinese poetry are heavily distorted by both English and translator
and the names Cao gave to the characters always imply something Jia BaoYu implies precious jade
green color or the the material women used to draw eyebrows
of course its an extremely feminine Chinese character for women Xue BaoChai implies precious hairpin
Etc I am distraught by the fact that the translator never mentioned on this  I will take one paragraph from Chapter  in Volume II
her eyes full of tears It had already been dark for some hours when she finally lay down to sleep Our story passes over the rest of that night in silence Next day was the twenty sixth of the fourth month
I think the most important quality of this piece of literature that qualifies it among the alltime classics is the layering of progressive ideas within traditional Chinese philosophy and structure The oppression censorship required Cao Xueqin to disguise all relatively innovative and rebellious themes under apparent themes of acceptance the current political and cultural status quo The strict censorship also explains why the final editors toned down the material before publishing the novel and the last  volumes fail to remain faithful to the true gold of the first  volumes  All good literature questions society and the individual
a skill in which Cao Xueqin proves to master I highly recomend this book to any patient readers If you struggle with deciphering the complex web of Chinese philosophy
This book was fascination not only for the cultural review of s in Manchu Qing Dynasty China and aristocratic households of the day
but also for the introspective look at family dynamics and confucian practices in the time  With the tragicromantic form of writing one feels a longing to understand how different life was in those times and places  I also got a great feel for what the writers intent was and the criticisms of political changes through the translaters appendixi and annotations  Great reading for thinkers
I wouldnt call this an exciting story however it is fascinating to see into the way of life of the very rich
including this one I am enjoying reading it and will continue with the next book in the series when I have finished this first novel in the series
enjoyable funny insight into a world that nolonger exists 
but every character recognizable in their flaws and failings and all the more loveable for that fact
I thought Id sample some Oriental literature and decided to dive into this epic family saga Having read this first volume and the second volume
I am very happy with my purchase It is tough to familiarise yourself with all the different characters in the book
but very soon you realise that the abundance of people within this one family household is one of the delights of the story Theres always something going on
or the frettings of the vast array of maids Dont expect anything dramatic to happen every twenty pages otherwise youll be disappointed This novel moves very slowly But it is meant to be realistic and this again is part of the charm Through reading its pages you learn a lot about Chinese culture of that time and this is exciting in its own way I read the first volume and fell in love with the characters so much that I could not conceive of not carrying on with the remaining four volumes I think that is a testament to how good the book is and
will be a perfect foil for the long evenings during the Covid lockdown period I started reading in earnest on May  and finished it on May  The th century saga
maps the rise and fall of two closelyrelated noble families The characters
profligate by nature
and often times find themselves on the wrong side of the law Imperial authorities confiscate the family properties once their misdeeds come to light After much tragedy
the family is eventually restored to its former position by the Emperor And inbetween all this fateful happenings
cultural and spiritual life of the time The Penguin translation was titled The Story of the Stone based on the novels frame story in which a sentient heavenly stone is sent to earth to live out the drama of human passion one of the main characters
is born with a jade in his mouth thereby suggesting that he was the sentient stone sent to earth by two enigmatic Taoist and Buddhist priests I still wish the Penguin had gone with the title Dream of the Red Chamber instead of The Story of the Stone I think the title Dream conveys a better sense of the underlying theme than the Stone The novel has some spectacular supernatural elements Volume  has some good dose of the supernatural
all those supernatural elements feel real like how one would feel the happenings in a dream as real That is the big success of this novel When the going is good
you can observe that one by one slowly falling prey to many superstitious practices This is a great insight into peoples psychology of clinging on to a sense of certainty and security as the world around them crumbles None of the characters can either be classified as good or bad in binary terms Each one has their good side as well as the bad side Perhaps this is the great strength of the novel as it lays emphasis on the shades of grey when it comes to judging a persons actions Often times
you can justify a characters actions from his or her point of view but cannot be justified from the others persons perspective One can spend a lifetime researching this novel Dont hesitate to enter the dream world created by the good old Cao Xueqin
Tremendous achievement on David Hawkes part Very good this is available on Amazon Kindle
Slow start and must be confusing for the Western reader who are not familiar with Chinese culture  Lots of names and interrelationship between the characters to get to grip with Book    is all about the good life lots of eating
partying and generally having a good time  The translation is good and I think its a great idea to leave main characters names as it is pronounced in Chinese but the maids etc are translated into easy to remember English names  Overall
la roman a une trs belle couverture avec la culture chinoise forte et attractive  cest la meilleure version anglaise que jai jamais savoir
I have long sought to start reading this six volume story  a classical Chinese story and I find a reasonably priced copy in USA  order it  Lo It is delivered efficiently  good deal Great
although it does illustrate the weird formalistic and ritualistic lifestyle and etiquette of highup Chinese in the th century
when coming up with the right poem at the right time seemed to be the key to advancement Good as an insight into this strange lifestyle
The book arrived on time and in a pristine condition
preserving the verse and as well as the prose sections of this classic work  One of the great pieces of Chinese literature along with Dreams of Red Mansions
philosophical leanings and even comedic elements that give this classic a timeless feel  For all its flaws there really is no better translation into English
The funny stories present in the first two volumes are almost nowhere to be found in this one there is one Moreover several of the stories revolve around sun wukong simply not bothering to inform his allies of the opponents special items and abilities The good settings and cultural differences between the human regions are well written  The stories themselves are varied in plots  Anthony Yus notes are invaluable for readers who are not eastern culture buffs The bad  The demons vary very little exept for in appearance One demon sounds and acts almost identically to the next  Tripitaka is still very annoying  When sun wukong finally comes across a worthy challenge a bodhisattva is almost instantly introduced to resolve the situation  Characters become feeble or genius level tactician and super slueth to fit the needs of the original author
I have many translations of this Chinese classic
as well as the original Chinese version  If you want a real feel for this story
you cannot go wrong with this version  Yes
Its not what youd imagine from a journey novel Challenges are overcome less so with violence and more with good ol trolling Fun to read
This is a wonderful translation of one of the Chinese classics Dont be intimidated by the length
they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book  I recommend this
to anyone interested in the culture
This is the third volume of Anthony C Yus fourvolume translation of the Chinese classic
The Journey to the West The story continues to be fantastical
despite its episodic nature
surprisingly compelling to me I was reading the previous volume in parallel with Ken Lius The Wall of Storms Once I started this third volume
I decided to shelve Ken Lius book in favor of Tripitaka and Pilgrims continuing adventures For a Chinese classic published over four hundred years ago
Even a fart is additional air I am now impatiently waiting for Amazon to deliver the final volume
this is Chinese culture If you know Sun Wu Kong you know Chinese people This edition is scholarly and brings the Jenner edition up to date
great novel
A great book Ahead of its time  Author did a magnificent job
A book worth reading Although reading the whole series in order is advisable Enjoy the endless Wisdom offered
all four are very good read Very entertaining and kept me occupied for a long time Written in very simple English
The Journey to the West I plodded through the lengthy but valuable introduction by the translator
then set off through the hundred fantastical chapters of the story   It is not a journey for those who like their fiction in small doses Nor does it fit the mold of most of the fantasy that I love True
but of the two main characters
supernatural monkey
puritanical monk Moreover
partly because it frequently breaks into poetry Perhaps the biggest departure from typical fantasy tomes is that the book is largely episodic It journeys westward without much of a dramatic arc While individual episodes have their battles and resolutions
the characters and the situation change slowly
the episodic quality more common to television series than to novels I liked the lightness of tone
the sense of fun Most of all
I grew fond of the characters
as I think the author was fond of them I wanted to spend time in their company
Im paraphrasing my husband in this review or trying to The Journey to the West was my birthday present to him  and he loved it He read a couple of pages to me
and it put me to sleep Reading the complete work is a labor of love for a scholarly person deeply interested in sixteenthcentury Chinese culture and its integration of Taoism
Buddhism and Confucianism The four hefty volumes offer a mythological and allegorical version of Xuanzangs journey to acquire scriptures in India Ordeals along the way illustrate the stages of spiritual transformation Xuanzang and his disciples are manifestations of the religious seeker Dealing with the ordeals reads a bit like a detective story Investigation reveals that the demons are often escapees from heaven According to my husband
the series is a fabulous exposition of Taoist internal alchemy and Chinese Buddhism
the second longest Ive taken but I am very glad to have read it  Despite a lot of repetition this epic of Chinese literature held my interest through all four volumes and I think I learned a lot
This is a translation of classic Chinese Buddhism tales  The writing appears faithful the style of the Chinese stories and old styles of telling stories  It is worth reading to get a better understanding of tales virtually every Chinese child learns at an early age  The whole series helped me in my appreciation of Chinese culture
Very readable translation I dont know how accurate it is
the poetry seems to be almost too good
I have many translations of this Chinese classic
as well as the original Chinese version  If you want a real feel for this story
you cannot go wrong with this version  Yes
or had it read to me It was extremely fun and entertaining This was the first time I had read the novel  I had seen a few movies that lead up to or were a truncated version of the actual story  Finally learning who the Handsome Monkey King was enlightening and aided my comprehension of a Taoist text I had read that discusses the monkey mind frequently  While the acknowledged hero in the story is the Buddhist monk who is sent on the journey to the west to retrieve sutras from the Buddha
the real hero is Sun Wukong
the Handsome Monkey King Hes the wildest hero Ive ever read about  It takes a while to get the actual journey by all  pilgrims but I enjoyed reading how the Sun Wukong became the Monkey King and created such a ruckus in Heaven Anyone who ever created a comic book or animated superhero must have read or heard of this story and used a variety of Sun Wukongs powers to create their hero  this will be yet another novel that Ill read at least once per year
they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book  I recommend this
to anyone interested in the culture
This non abridged version is much more enjoyable than an abridged version I read previously
prosperous place and the unjustly condemned souls will be rescued But the journey is fraught with difficulties and deadly perils In the end it takes  years in the process the four pilgrims meld themselves into a potent
so its an entertaining introduction to those folks The tone is lighthearted even the constant threats to the Tang priests life
as monsters try to capture and eat him thereby obtaining eternal life by consuming a piece of his pure flesh have a funny side A lot of humor is provided by the irreverent Monkey hes incapable of very much humility and constantly violates social conventions
including being immortal and having the power to work all sorts of magic
but his hubris often leads him astray This is pitched as a childrens tale  although the occasional sex and almost constant fairytale violence might make it an older childrens tale  and the characters reflect childish impulsiveness and disregard for ceremony Its a fun read
hes really loving it The story has all the appeal of a Martial Arts novel
and a Buddhist philosophical treatise blended into a thoroughly entertaining tale for all ages I previously read Adventures of Monkey King ISBN  to my son
and while the language was much more appropriate for a young child
the story was overly abridged
and a lot of the detail that makes the story fun and interesting was lost This edition tells the beginning and the end of the story very well
because that makes it easier to go back to the full version of the story Journey to the West Volume Boxed Set
the actual journey itself is the smallest part of the story  Its all about setting up the characters and reaching Inda  In the fulllength version
and how it changes the characters This version is very good for those who want to get the flavor of the characters and find out what happens
but the full version is best for those who really just want to enjoy reading about the Monkey King doing what he does best
the full version can drag a bit if youre hoping to actually see the plot move along I have heard that the book MonkeyFolk Novel of China ISBN  best captures the comedic aspects of the story
so thats what I plan to do The story is that good
The only book out of dozen different authored ones Includes the story of the monkey from the beginning  most books only start from the monk  written in plain English as English books   translated or not  should be  some books are written for and understood only by students and scholars 
its alright overall but leaves a lot out  Consider it a good primer for readers interested in the whole folklore of this legend
The book is difficult for most Western readers
because some of the language is so fantastic in its description of all the different spirits
etc  But just stick with it and by the end of the book you will have an increased understanding of the mythology that works its way into a lot of Chinese Cultural opionions I initially started reading this
and I was born in the Boar Year  The  main characters of the novel are Monkey
which were the best part of this classic
I have read the printed version of the Journey to the West before and thought it would be nice to have the eBook version for my Android  Its like visiting old friends when I read about the Monkey King
there are peaceful solutions to anything  A delightful read of wisdom
The Journey to the West is a classic and its great read Classic Chinese literature is poetic with life lessons all in a great adventure tale The scene descriptions are hyperbolic but should be read as a tale being told to an audience
I had to read this book for an Asian religious studies class and it was by far one of my favorite readings from the class Im a slow reader but I managed to finish this in the course of just a few days The plot and characters really pull you in and its an easy read
This is a solid translation of the work
embarrassing misspellings For example
etc While these do not generally impede your understanding of the book
It was probably the longest book Ive ever read and Im a voracious reader Growing up in Chinese martial arts with a Taoist Si Fu and Buddhist Si Mu
An interesting story
one of four classics of ancient Chinese literature gives insight into the cultural outlook on self improvement with charm and humor
epic tale If you saw the TV show in the Eighties youll love the book It brings Monkey  all your favourites back to life
It is an amazing story with a lot of interesting characters not found in Western literature If you want to understand Chinese religion
characters for a Westerner seeking to better understand the Chinese psyche
Outlaws of the Marsh and Dream of the Red Chamber and accordingly contains much that will on the one hand provoke
entertain and inspire the modern reader while also containing much many are likely to find infuriating The basic plot is simple and wellknown and easily researchable on Wikipedia and other web sites An emperor of Chinas Tang dynasty
and the horse Pig and Friar Sand were heavenly Generals who messed up and were put into the bodies of animals The horse is a dragon who is working off a sin by being in the body of a horse Monkey was born of stone and is redeeming himself after having caused considerable chaos in and even revolted against heaven
for God This is based on a true story wherein a Tang emperor really did send a monk on a mission to bring back Buddhist scripture
and also gather information a Lewis  Clark type exploratory mission Its a long trip accomplished on foot and for the monk
the length of the trip is the least of the challenges Again and again and again the party is beset by demons many of whom want to eat the monks flesh in order to gain eternal life something that is said to be possible given the monks purity Unlike other famous fictional voyagers
come from the nature of the adventures quite varied and imaginative and perhaps more important
and between Monkey and the other disciples The monk is the prototypical whiney nerd As mentioned
and most powerful lots of magic powers sidekick in all of literature East or West So youd think the Monk would revere and trust Monkey
Monk gets so angry at what he perceives to be a bad attitude on the part of Monkey
but a distant second behind Monkey Im not sure why the author fusses about the horse and Friar Sand Neither has any discernable personality and both seem to be there just to carry stuff And this is where we begin to get into things that may annoy a modern Western reader The practice of the art of fiction here is not what were used to The epic relies a lot
and I mean A HECK Of A LOT on a fictional technique known as deus ex machina which translates literally to God out of the machine Its well known in ancient Greek theater The author sets up a fascinating plot conflict and then finds himself unable to logically solve it
so an actor playing one the Gods is lowered to the scene from a set of pulleys the machine to sort everything out The Greeks get away with it because the conflict is usually more important than the details of how its resolved
conflict and escape are paramount
it bombards you again and again and again time after time after time in the same epic to the point where it becomes tempting to skip ahead once the conflict is established because you pretty much know whats coming In fact
or something that was cobbled together from a lot of separate adventure stories I have no idea what the answer is
the end implies it is a unified epic and that the crises were orchestrated from heaven to enable the Monk to become worthy of receiving the scriptures But again
I cant swear this wasnt grafted on at a later time One of the things that leads me to wonder about this being a unified epic is the way the Monk fails to even start to come to grips with Monkeys merits until the very end To a modern Western reader
the underdeveloped characterizations of Friar Sand and the horse lead me to wonder if they were developed in other segments of the story that got lost
and how reading it feels as you get beyond the chapters of introductory material Clearly
the most intriguing character
and the one that makes the whole thing worthwhile is Monkey His evolution from literatures most potent ahole to its most potent protector is riveting and addictive Its a fascinating object lesson to anyone who has occasion to deal with difficult but talented people The end of the story implies the monk needed to suffer to earn the right to get the scriptures We modern folks
Lost too much stuff including some most core stories The pictures do not fit their descriptions The worst version I have ever seen
only with a mean streak and a propensity for fighting and drinking and stealing and causing cosmic mayhem  is a folk story dating back to the sixteenth century Its an allegory of the struggle we must all face before a spiritual transformation is possible Like most great spiritual journeys
Monkey is spurred by a desire to become immortal Given that he was born from a magic stone fructified by the seeds of Heaven and Earth
but that point is lost on Monkey He sets out to learn all the secrets
and elders and spiritual leaders and demons and dragons The list is so massive
and most of the cultural references were completely lost on me I wish there was a cheat sheet of characters to provide context because the significance of the Moon Goddess and Jade Emperor and Dragon King of the Western Ocean was obscure Still
Kherdian gives delightful dialog to his characters
especially the Monkey King The Handsome Monkey King  A reader feels that he has probably met someone  this brash and outrageous in real life  The plot moves quickly for lively reading  It is more engrossing and even more exciting than recent film treatments of the story A good introduction to Journey to the West
a Chinese classic novel  Hopefully the reader will want to find out more about the story
I thought this story would be heavily involved in Eastern Philosohpy
the magical transformations used monkey growing to  feet tall
This is one of my favorite books that I will very seldom recommend to people The reason for this is that while I found the long tangents
quirky characters
and great length of the book to be fantastically entertaining
though there was enough variance in each story to keep me interested The book also can be rather longwinded at times
This is a decent telling of the Chinese story
but it doesnt deliver on its own promises Kherdian says that he includes more episodes and more of the spiritual aspects of the story than are found in the famous Arthur Waley version
he does no such thing especially in a crucial and famous scene toward the end Kherdians version is certainly readable and enjoyable
Kherdians version may be better for younger readers than Waleys as
ninja type themes The original text is
the reason for the depth of philosophical thought which the series contains I have no idea whether the philosophy goes into kids heads
but they seem to love it and the book makes great bedtime reading for children who love the series
and provides significant insight into Chinese culture and thought patterns
past and present The story is easy to pick up and follow in episodes I will confess that I skipped over some of the flowery and lengthy descriptive poetic sections
but this is a good read This edition is marred by having no good navigation system
This translation of the classic Chinese novel is not nearly as good as the previous Arthur Waley edition
also available from Amazon  This edition has the advantage of being greatly simplified
and therefore may be more suitable for young readers  Fans of the Waley edition might also be interested in this edition as a source for a few slightly different stories selected from the much longer original  However
this edition eliminates much of the texture of the original and is overall much
much shorter than Waleys  Most readers would be far wiser to choose Waleys classic edition  This is a poor substitute at best
and I have to say that this version is definitely the most readable of all of them That being said
I did find the story to be a little light on the Eastern wisdom it was meant to deliver However
if youre looking for a fun story based on some Eastern principles to read to your children
If  you are a huge fan of the Journey to the West do not purchase this abridgement
buy the whole  volume set also available on Amazon  Otherwise the translation and abridgement here is fine for a quick
Its a great read but thats just me because I love Asian myths and things of the sort But few know that this book is the basis of the incredibley popular anime Dragon Ball Z Yes thats right
the great king of the mountain is ox king If you are a big time DBZ fan like me
I downloaded the sample for this and found the TOC worthless Chapter  to Chapter  are listed But they arent even hyperlinked Any other decent sample book Ive tried has a hyperlinked TOC I deleted it then and there Found a free copy elsewhere on the web with hyperlinks and even quick chapter summaries That ones a keeper
so I decided to read the actual book and events and I have enjoyed every single page so far Sometimes a little hard to grasp but I get there eventually well worth it for any Far East lover or Monkey fan
it also sends the message of peace and tolerance in the form of the Buddhist monk Sanzang known better in the West as Tripitaka set in a time of great upheaval
and its the same wordforword  I point this out as there are a few abridged versions available So
initially produced in installments  For those of you familiar with the Japanese TV series Monkey
and subsequent dismissal from Heaven  The next part of the book introduces the rest of the team Triptaka
Pigsy and the Horse  Then the book goes into the adventures the team have as chronicled in the aforementioned TV series The formatting of the Kindle version is very good and I have yet to find any of the infamous typos and poor format found in some Kindle books  The formatting is not as good as the print version the chapter subheadings appear to be continuous with the text of the book but then again
I am delighted with this purchase
and I would recommend this version to fans of the TV series who want to learn more about Monkey and who enjoy a good read
Its hard to know how to review this one It does indeed appear to be the Unabridged edition of Journey to the West translated by WJF Jenner
which is in copyright and published by Foreign Language Press in four volumes This edition certainly has some errors of the kind consistent with OCR and suffers from poor formatting and a lack of a table of contents  which for a work of this size is badly needed It also lacks any copyright information
and doesnt include the extensive introduction of the FLP edition It is published by an unknown publisher called Monkey King So
but my daughter isnt She has heard about the monkey king from us and was interested in hearing the story
so we ordered this book The translation is slightly awkward
especially the inconsistent translation of names some are translated by meaning
such as Piggy and some are phonetic translations of the Chinese name
such as Xuan Zeng I find myself frequently making changes to the translation or adding explanations to make it more understandable or interesting to my daughter That being said
I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be to translate this particular story into English and abridge it for young readers
so I was looking for an English version to read  This gave me the basic story line
The quality of the book is very good
the content translation is very good
I became interested in this book after watching Forbidden Kingdom The story of the Monkey King is thoughtful and entertaining  The Kindle edition was a no brainer at  cents  The translation is fantastic and it reads like it was written with English being its original language  Highly recommend to anyone interested in the Monkey King
Journey to the West has truly stood the test of time A fun read hundreds of years after it was written
I bought it for my children as I absolutely love everything journey to the west since growing up loving the TV show monkey The pictures are great and the story well put together Love this thank you
plain language and images to foreign readers to understand the Journey to the West story
The Journey to the West is one of the Four Great works of Chinese literature  Kathryn Lin retells this story in a format accessible to young
and very young children  Each of the  pages of this book is richly illustrated with numerous
for  parents wishing to expose their children to Chinese language or culture at an early age
the author intersperses common Chinese characters along with pronunciation and a concise definition The character of the Monkey King is reminiscent of Curious George Or
Amazingly well done and beautiful art Great intro book for little ones to learn about the monkey king and his story
bright The length of it was also enough to be a good story time book Good addtion for a childs library Would recommend
providing parents the perfect opportunity to expose their children to a culture different from their own How clever of Lin to write this story Bravo
Wukong  This is a great retelling of story  I love the illustrations  I am buying a copy for my nephew
Love the book The story is interesting and fun I bought one for my niece as her birthday gift She really enjoys the story and learns Chinese words Highly recommended
Now for the diatribe  This is the nd translation I have read For the westerner all the Chinese names can get confusing One approach is to imagine an Asian coming to America and all your friends names are Smith
the Three Kingdoms has been much more enjoyable Sometimes history is just better than the the most creative fiction Now
this is a romanticized version of a piece of early Chinese history almost  years ago Every so often
an event in actual history regarding some actions by Cao Cao that is
and a very dark stain to Chinese history OK
so there are some serious stains in Scottish and western history   As a westerner
I wish the story of our founding fathers could be half as exciting Have fun and good luck  Dont try to read it on the bus or during your lunch break You might get fired for no showing up to work
Moss Roberts translation is absolutely fantastic Much more alive than others Take the opening sentences Here begins our tale The empire
tends to divide This has been so since antiquity Or Hegels Empires wax and wane states cleave asunder and coalesce Its really no contest Roberts prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout Hes that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes and there are a lot are at the back of the nd volume
heavy books I dont know if there are other highquality printings of Roberts translation which might improve on this issue
I first encountered Moss Roberts translation in a greatly abridged version which I took with me on my first trip to China  It greatly increased my enjoyment of the trip  Now Dr Roberts has completed his translation of the whole novel  It is much more readable than the only other complete translation in English
Timeless classic  Very nice paper binding
good job
I found   and noticed a lot of similar names  I played it and it was FANTASTIC  I thought I was fulfilled in my living of Chinese mythhistory until my mother bought me this four volume set for Christmas  I was dumbfounded and immediately tore the plastic wrapping off and started reading  They were all there  All my favorite characters in my favorite games were all there and now
they were people on the page in print living out the digital approximations I had loved so much  Watching the formation of the Kingdom of Shu lead by the virtuous Liu Bei and Guan Yu with insurmountable strategist Zhuge Liang as the Prime Minister seeing the powerhungry Cao Cao usurping the Han Emperors throne the brilliant but always foiled plans of Zhou Yu to kill Zhuge Liang this wonderful story woven through each volume is PURELY RIVETING  Play the games  Buy the books Live the adventure
it was pouring with rain and the packet contained expensive text books Had they not have been urgently required for an academic thesis I would have returned them However the need was great and half an hour of careful application of a hairdryer  allowed  the pages of the uppermost volume to to separate and thus be read Amazon is a convenient way to buy textbooks and other goods but the regularity of of crass stupidly by couriers who leave expensive items on the front doorstep and so visible from an adjacent footpath
solid state electronics left exposed to the elements  and even albeit boxed  jewelry resting against some outer door Risky
and positively the act of the indolent and those who speed rather than adhering to the instructions recorded against the delivery advice EMail
A long read but possibly he best and most engrossing book Ive ever read  A massive cast of characters fortunately theres a list of characters to refer to at the back of the book  Footnotes help with the context but are out of the body of the text so dont interfere with the flow of the story  The writing style of the translator makes the book very readable and it cracks along at a fair pace
I highly recommend this outstanding two volume set
to anyone interested in the classic literature of China Terrific in terms of both content and shelf appeal
its a must have for avid readers of great works
This item arrived quickly and in good condition  I hope I have purchased that right Part  as there were more than one book with the same title but nothing to indicate which book comes with
excellent value There are no notes nor explanatory matter If the great number of characters is confusing you can find maps
Great story Well made book Fast shipping The print is tiny to the point of being too hard for these old eyes to read Invest the extra money for a legible print size
Excellent book about the Romance warring era Just wish the print was a little bigger Tons of characters to keep track of too
This edition of the Chinese classic has print thats unreadably tiny  The print margins are nearly nonexistent and the prints uneven on the pages  I had to send it back
The problem Im having is distinguishing numerous characters from the locales mentioned  There is very little basis to differentiate people from places as the names are so similar in spelling and the characters are many
 words Suggestions for more enjoyable reading are at the bottom of his review Ive yet to run across another book that has done a better job of integrating combat action
tactics and politics  In spite of its length I never got tired of reading it  It leaves an impression the further you readas I progressed through the book I noticed that I began to think more strategicallylike a chess player This is a historical novel
not an authoritative history text  The history text of this period was RECORDS OF THE THREE KINGDOMS and like many works of fiction based on history
prophetic dreams some of them horrible nightmares
is probably as close to a peyote vision as most of us will ever get  But it also presents us the enigma of powerful men  Cao Cao was a great military leader and political ruler
but Cao Cao cant give up his earthly power and his yearning to defeat and dominate other mortals  In spite of that
powerful men are also hungry for supernatural powers  They need to see the future and science only takes them so far  They also have to dabble in religious thinking because everyone down to the humblest peasant takes the mandate of heaven very seriously  Its so serious that it starts a civil war in China
possibly the hardest country in the ancient world in which to wage a civil war due to its massive geographic size This is also the story of effective military leaders and advanced military technology in the ancient world  There were great strategists and generals like Cao Cao
The Shu army suffered a major setback because of one bad gully  Combats involved not only swordsmen but also messengers
disguised as livestock  Even tribesmen had metallic carriages  This is one of the best novels Ive ever read  stars Suggestions for more enjoyable reading  The first third of the book is essentially background The story of how the Han dynasty became three separate kingdoms will be told here The problem for you if youre a Westerner like me is that it is chock full of Chinese names In the course of the book youll become familiar with Liu Bei
make a cheat sheet with what I would consider to be the most important names along with a small bit of biographical information on each  Try to limit this information to their rank
you can find decent maps on the internet  I found two or three maps that were useful  I found the most useful map by googling Map of the Three Kingdoms and then downloading the map with the white land mass with the word WEI in blue
SHU in red and WU in green  The problem is that this map is huge  What I did was to use my graphics software to cut this map into smaller pieces  The best idea is to cut them centering on the borders of the kingdoms because thats where the battles will be  I printed the JPG as a PDF document  Then I found an online utility that converted PDF to MOBI format and put the maps on my Kindle or did I just put the PDF on the Kindle  Try both to see which works  It was a bit of a pain to keep leaving the book to look at the maps
I cant finish all my compliment for this book in this short review You are not gonna believe it is such a splendid book until you read it yourself This book is a saga with so much wisdom and humanity It is as good as ancient Greek epic with all repect to Greek if not better The wisdom in it is uncommonly plentiful Trojan horse looks childrens game after you finished the book Romance of three kingdoms is a part of Chinese lives and now becoming popular in the world Many Japanese companies make this book as a mustread for management staff Read this book and I garantee that your time will be delightfully spent
A very precise translation of this book Excellent for students
qui plaira aux rudits ou  ceux qui parlent  ou sentraine  parler  les deux langues  pour la livraison  ne pas mettre de protection antichoc autour  des livres a provoqu un plis visible sur la premire centaine de pages du premier tome
and as described I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend to others
If you are going to start reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms then you should start with this book series This edition is more coherent and well put together with footnotes at the bottom and end of each chapter There is a character list in the beginning with brief descriptions The names and places are spelledpronounced more accurately This series is a MUST for any fan of classical literature
Best translation that I have of the series I have  different ones Very happy with this book
culture and even its politics Very excellent translation bravo
It makes the great classic available to readers who are more comfortable witj English
yet retains the feel of the original language This is especially evident in the translated poems
My year old LOVES this book Hes read it twice already
victory at the Battle of Red Cliff against Cao Coa and then gone on to capture important cities
thus vastly increasing Liu Beis military power with additional soldiers and control of wealthy cities and provinces Liu Bei dies in Vol  leaving control of his kingdom to his son Liu Shan Cao Cao
seeks to take advantage of Liu Beis death and inexperience of Liu Shan Cao Cao comes up with a cunning scheme to attack Liu Shans kingdom from five directions I was anxious to read how Zhuge Liang was going to deal with this new threat However he reclused himself in his hut and would not come out Finally after  days
Liu Shan goes to Zhuge Liangs hut to hear what plans he has in mind Zhuge Liang has brilliant plans to thwart each of the five attacks He will himself lead the attack again the fierce Man tribes In his fight against the Mans
after the battle he releases their leader on the faith of his good word that they will not fight again This happens six times that Zhuge Liang battles and has victory over the Mans
the leader of the Mans was so humiliated that he agreed to have a peace alliance with Liu Shan and have peaceful cooperation in the future The Three Kingdoms story is truly one of the great classics of literature This translation is easy reading The footnotes were not only helpful
the footnotes at the bottom of the page made the flow of the story more meaningful
these can be a difficult read from the perspective of so many historical figures coming and going
particularly later on in the series  I have pretty extensive knowledge of this era of history
its just not very interesting in terms of what happened near the end of the period especially in comparison to they first two volumes  The figures of the later part of this time just feel flat as compared to their predecessors There are some editing errors
etc and some odd word choices considering the context hubbub
NOTE This is a review for all three volumes of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms I had been aware of this epic of Chinese literature for many years
I would strongly recommend watching that aforementioned TV series prior to reading the books This may sound the wrong way around
it would have been considerably harder without some preknowledge of key characters to anchor my progress Having some understanding
certainly makes getting through the book a mite less daunting Another warning for those considering embarking on the Three Kingdoms if you are not interested in military strategy and take no pleasure in reading about the minutiae of war
often in quick succession While war itself is not the core of what the Three Kingdoms is about
it is nevertheless the medium through which many of the storys messages are related This is a fictionalised account of a very real historic period in Chinese history After the fall of the Han dynasty in  AD
the country fell into a state of civil war
as rival warlords fought one another for superiority  each claiming to be the rightful successor to Han Gradually power consolidated around three separate kingdoms Wei in the North
Wu in the South and Shu in the West Each was led by its own charismatic leader  Cao Cao
and widely recognised in China as one of the greatest books ever written For me
this book is about much more than just a historic narrative Still less is it a book merely about military tactics  although they certainly feature prominently throughout Rather
each with their own agendas The ruthlessness of Cao Cao is tempered by his intellectual brilliance and his ability to exercise power without ever openly admitting to it The virtue of Liu Bei
and the relationship between power and those who would shape and direct that power is fascinating Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi both stand out as impressive figures in their own right
the legendary fighter who keeps his honour to his very last breath Another lesson the Three Kingdoms teaches is that for all the struggles and grand designs
winning or losing may very often lie in the lap of the gods A rainstorm at the wrong moment or a change in the direction of the wind can make all the difference Illnesses strike down otherwise undefeated veterans
just as ultimately the collapse of the three kingdoms ends up owing more to the dissipation and idleness of the rulers successors than to any great military victory Power is ephemeral
and it cannot ever be taken for granted There are so many stories and subplots woven into the fabric of the Three Kingdoms that it would be both infeasible and futile to assess them all here The best I can say of this book is that it is a joy to read and its many pages a wonderful place within which to lose yourself It is long
and there will be times when you may wonder if the battles will ever end with one siding achieving anything close to a significant victory but stick with it and you will be rewarded
I find myself rereading some sentences But its a great read for history buffs and fans of the Dynasty Warriors games
I think this is the third different Three Kingdoms version that I buy on Amazon and I really like it The novel is awesome just check wikipedia for the plot
One of the four classic books of Chinese literature An epic journey to an age of heroes
Not a review of the book but rather a review of this edition It is filled with grammatical errors and typos Awful and unreadable and Im really disappointed that I both the entire set of the books since they seem so poorly done I read  pages before giving up Almost unreadable if you care about grammar at all  there was an error in the first sentence domains tends to unite
This version is horrible The translator paraphrases so liberally that it actually takes away from the story Other reviews mentioned that there are tons of grammatical errors and they were correct These two facts make it a pain to read  not to mention the size of the books  they are heavy and huge  and mine had almost  margins along the pages
with text on about  of each page This made the book unwieldy I would say Moss Roberts version is far superior in every aspect
The book is a good read for people who wish to learn Chinese history or have some understanding of Chinese history Its pretty hard Anyway
both books arrived in excellent condition and on time Thank you
I began to suspect whether it was even editedproofed by someone fluent in English Then I went on to Amazon to look for another version of Romance of the Three Kingdoms from a reputable press Tuttle Classics
bootlegged text I havent gotten around to getting a better copy and reading the story
get a real translation
There is no denying that Dream of Red Mansions Hong Lou Meng is an important piece of Chinese literature However
I did not really enjoy this book I found the characters to be frustrating and the pace slow Although this is the abridged version
it is still extremely long and not an easy read I cant imagine how long reading the unabridged version would take Although I did not enjoy reading this book
it is a critical piece of Chinese literature The book moves slowly through various episodes in Jia Biaoyu and Lin Diayus life
demonstrating a new type of novel  the chainlink novel that could be read by the masses The book also gives insight to Chinese culture While not my personal taste
this is a good book for those studying Chinese literature
This is a must read for every culture Beautifully written novel based on Chinese history during the end of the Ching dynasty Difficult to set down once you pick it up
This translation conveniently comes in a complete set of  volumes  The cost per book is great
at a little over  per book vs the  per book for Penguins volume series Each volume is quite thick  The entire series is a little over 
so itll take a long time to read  I find the translation to be satisfactory
especially of the poems  The story is engrossing and keeps me turning page after page  I often go back to reread beautiful passages  Occasionally there are some illustrations There are some areas in which the book could improve The multitude of characters and relationships makes it difficult to follow sometimes  There is a family tree on one page
I wish that the aesthetics of the book matched the beauty of the story more  Its slightly unfortunate that they just put the title in the Impact font on the spine
The Foreign Language Press has also translated the other  greats of Chinese literature  Journey to the West  Outlaws of the Marsh  Romance of the Three Kingdoms I have read all of the previous  and been favorably impressed in the quality of the translations as well as the comprehensiveness of including the full novel Other translations I have tried to read had more flowery but less accurate prose
then dont look anywhere else and get this version of the books If you have tried to read these before in a different setting but been unhappy
then give these a go  This is as good as it gets and you owe is to yourself to reread them in a correct translation Yes
the pages can be thin at times but thats a minor annoyance compared to the quality of the translationtext
This is long and very detailed and discusses chinese life at a time in history
the size of the books and just tge general feel of them  I truly enjoy reading and I have a deep desire to learn about other cultures and their stories
and this one is simply excellent Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate
and the style more than satisfactory
Im sure The story takes place in old China
his rich background
the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page
the gardenscenes which get names in the form of short poems not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems
probably inspired by this Chinese tradition Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of  years ago
the other world mixes invariably with this life
making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth
each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style
I found that it was difficult to follow in spite of being very motivated It may be a cultural thing so I am going to try to donate it to the the Asian history department of my local university
This is a wonderful translation I have read both the Hawkes before
he also takes far more license to create his desired effects This translation is far more faithful to the original and allows more of the multidimensional layers from the original to come out
I have read several different translated versions and this one seems to cover the most in a very condensed paper back The Original book is over  pages I think and that is before the follow up author took it upon himself to finish the  original unfinished work Les put it this way there are several movies the most recent with English sub titles is  episodes each an hour and a half long
This is the story of a great Chinese family in decline  It is told mainly through the lives of the women and servants of the family and a boy who loved the company of the maids who surround him  The attention to every domestic detail is delightful  I think the story takes place in the th century  I dont think it can be read in a hurry  One needs to be alert while reading so it is not a bedtime book Allow a year or so to enjoy it  I return to it again and again
Not a good translation and hard to follow I wish the translation was better into what is a classic book with many meanings
This Chinese classic still has the power to surprise and delight  This edition has good footnotes and good translation
and it was in very good condition
Totally engrossing  The reader becomes enmeshed in the family and their day to day events A great read  Reads like a diary
I am able to enjoy and visualize the story better The other book does have nice prose However
good book long on some chapter lots of explain but still good
Not a great translation
This book is like Anna Karenina in the following ways Both are masterpieces of epic proportions Both are considered contenders for being the greatest works of fiction in their respective languages Both deal with large
an unusual child in his early teens who is temperamental and spends most of his time with the girls in the family mansion and Daiyu
sensitive and yet witty and extremely clever girl The two grow up as children and live in the same mansion but the family does not hurry to marry them off as they have other plans for Baoyu This is the main thread that runs through the novels amazing  chapters The other sublots are very numerous  there are hundreds  but none of them are sustained for the whole book The main part of the book is the set of characters Again there are hundreds but a few main ones which become the most interesting in this drama Theres the conniving Xifeng
jokes and poems which was where I think the translation failed the most as Chinese poetry rendered into English seems to lose the plot It contains moments of great sadness but also wit and quirkiness Theres been controversy with the amazon reviews of this particular translation I dont speak Chinese so cant judge it but reading the text
it seemed fine I guess if I saw another or the original it would change my mind but this one isnt too bad The novel deals with so many topics that you really get an overview of what life in th century upper class urban China was about It is VERY long but its amazing how in relating heaps and heaps of seemingly trivial incidents you grow to love many of the characters Its like most novels are like meeting someone and hence only seeing what they want to show while this novel is like living with them And trivialities aside
its very moving A must for all interested in Chinese society or who dont mind persevering through  pages to read a one of the worlds unusual and amazing dynasty chronicles and love stories
unabridged translation of the greatest Chinese classical novel of manners Dream of the Red Chamber  One is the Penguin classics version translated by Oxford doyen David Hawkes and his soninlaw John Minford
now available on paperbacks in  volumes under the alternate title The Story of the Stone  The other is this China Foreign Language Press version made in the late s by Chinese translators Yang Xianyi and his wife Gladys With all due respects to the Yangs
their translation just isnt on par with the Penguins  The original novel is a paragon of how the classical vernacular Chinese language should be written Yangs version is stodgy and halfhearted and captures none of the elegance and depth of the original  Their English borders on paraphrase at times and they dont appear to bother about stylistic recreation
much better The Yangs works could be serviceable as in their decent Lu Hsun but this version of Dream of the Red Mansions is embarassingly outclassed by a far superior and more idiomatic rendition David Hawkess version is simply unparalleled and a labor of love Given a choice between the two translations
obdurate settlement of her debt with fate and her surrender to lonely circumstances of death Events in this despondent installment afford layers in increasing intensity of poignancy that presage Lin Daiyus death and Baoyus erroneous marriage to Baochai at the insistence of the Jias The volume begins with an ailing Lin Daiyu dreaming a bad dream that confronts her pentup fear and fevered mind Like a rope on a pulley Daiyus hopes and fears spin up and down with sighs and tears Her health takes a huge toll and deteriorates drastically The critical nature of her condition both alarms and frightens the maids who for fear of Baoyus lapsing into delirium decides to conceal from him While Daiyu harbors an acute sense of insecurity being an outsider in the Jias mansion and broods about being at the mercy of the Jias
the family deliberately reconsiders the auspicious match between jade and the golden locket Baochai is crowned with praise for having the aplomb of someone twice her age Her virtuous disposition finds favor in the eyes of all the ladyships As the Jias frantically prepare for the wedding without Daiyus knowing
the delicate frowner happens to eavesdrop the news and plunges into utter mortification The prophecy contained in her nightmare is to be duly fulfilled after all Bitterness and grief overwhelm her to the point that she conceives the only way to escape is death She is determined to undermine her health and seizes her fate The marriage between Baoyu and Baochai is an unfortunate mistake It is an unexpected outcome of an incidence that should have otherwise favored Daiyu and spared her death The sudden disappearance of Baoyus jade
nullifies the bond of gold and jade But little does Daiyu realize that the loss of the jade on which Baoyus life hinges causes the Jias to panic The family resorts to hurry the wedding between Baoyu and Baochai to turn Baoyus luck and rally his spirits This paradox of the lost jade expounds the mysterious vagaries of destiny
there hangs the consistent reminder of some transcendental existence Somehow the cycle of life is totally out of our calculation and grip The wheel of karma is what inevitably governs the cycle of life and the human soul is only playing out a predetermined role Life doesnt end at death for death is merely dispersion The bitter end of the tragic story of love between Baoyu and Daiyu throws the former into a delirium What follows would be a significant theme Cao Xueqin intends for the novel
One of the great classics of world literature Having read both this translation and the David Hawkes five volume translation of this novel
I personally prefer this one Although the David Hawkes translation is smoother and more literary for the English speaking reader
I find that the Yang translation better conveys the atmosphere of th and th century China and the complex relationships between the various members of the upper class Chia household and their omnipresent bevy of slaves and servants I even greatly enjoyed
the sayings of Chairman Mao inspired introduction to this translation Im now ready to embark on my fourth reading of this book in about as many years
Even though some may say that the translation is less then brilliant I still enjoyed the story very much I was quiet sad actually when the story ended It made me feel like no other book had ever made me feel Ive always cheered on the good guys like in Outlaws of the Marsh or The Three Kingdoms
but this time I really cared about these characters Shakespeares got nothing on this story The charcters expressed the way they felt through poetry and music I was in the room and I knew these people It accomplishes everything every other story never could Im just afraid Ill never have that same feeling again
This is book tells the story of a clan which is in the rundown It is centered in a young man
and all his sisters Dont expect a story in the traditional point of view
just daily life in the Rong and Ning mansions Do not expect either a very deep story or characters
it is kind of superficial in fact although there a lot of characters and their whereabouts and machinations are told It gives an insight though into what might have been the life in that land and in that time
keep in mind though that this still a book An overall enjoyable piece
OMG Second thought Not the best story line so far
you must read it If you want to enjoy the great Chinese culture
you defenitely must read it The translation is also the best one I have ever seen But if you try to read the original Chinese edition,maybe you will be more agreed on what I recommended
or english educated you will have difficulty in pronouncing chinese names of places and people romanized by the pinyin method the pinyin method is only immediatelyinstinctively useable for the chinese speakingreading person tongued with foreknowledge to a nonchinese speakingreading person pinyin is pinyinhell because you never know how to say it in  or  different ways even if you have heard how one pinyin name is correctly pronounced you are still guessing when you come across names spelt similarly then
before embarking on reading pinyin books these rules are quite unnatural or to put in kindly  foreign  to the englishspeaking tongue here are a few taken from the web q  Consonant ch as in  cheek u  Vowels oo as in  too ue  Diphthong as i in  ship ui  Diphthong pronounced as  wee v  Consonant used only to pronounce foreign words  The Chinese have great difficulty pronouncing the V w  Consonant as in  want x  Consonants sh as in  she y  Consonant as in  yet z  Consonant as in  zero zh  Consonant j as in  jump most pinyintranslations do not provide such a list of rules or coach readers in this matter
means to scold did that clarify the rules or compounded the difficulty frustrations runs high and runs often everytime a pinyin name comes up i cringe which is like every other sentence for the casual reader
how close or by what degree it agree with the original language is hardly the key to successful reading or its enjoyment if you seriously want to learn all the subtle tones i suggest you take up mandrin reading and writing  and then find the original version and enjoy that
Roger Ames and Henry Rosemont offer a new translation of this Chinese classic of Confucius  While I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy or integrity of the translation
Ames and Rosemont have explained and offered justifications for their translations quite thoroughly  The result is an informative version of this classic text attributed to Confucius  Heavily discussing the ethics of ritual propriety and the need to be a junzi or exemplary person
Confucius believed in wisdom and the law of reciprocity the silver rule  Clearly he was concerned with preserving a moral tradition extracted from the collective understanding of the past  While parts of Ames and Rosemonts introduction are tedious and could be better written
overall they have made a valuable contribution to the understanding of Confucian thought
making it not only a much more enjoyable read but one where the meaning of translation comes to life I am very thankful that Ames wrote this book as it has allowed me a glimpse into my heritage
The chapters on the culturallinguistic problems involved in translating Classical Chinese texts and whether the Chinese ever produced philosophy are more than worth the price of this book Puruse the sayings of the Master carefully with close attention to the invaluable notes and a different world is opened This is philosophy
The wisdom and patience in which Confucius analyzed each and every situation was very appealing to me It causes one to reflect on every situation before acting or dismissing any topic that may be encountered
What an excellent resource for Asian studies in general  The translation is great to compare with Lau et al And the other material sheds light on previous interpretations of the text and context
Foucault and Rorty  That is as absurd as it gets But academics do not make a name for themselves being correct outside of the hard sciences that is  If they were correct
they would simply answer questions in a way that satisfactory to readers and move on to the harder questions  Instead
they rise to the top of their fields by being wrong in the cleverest way imaginable and that is what Ames has done  So a generation of American students and scholars are being taught that Confucius would be right at home with some s style sophistry  It is actually kind of funny now that I think about it  I guess when you start with the premise that truth is a social construct
I like having this book around to study from on occasion  A lot of books dont include any Chinese language aspects so I chose this one for that purpose  Confucius is definitely open to interpretation so taking the time to study the principles is a must if you are interested in it
Potential buyers of the Kindle edition should be aware that I could only read the first page of the bibliography on my Kindle   a pretty serious shortcoming for a scholarly book  though all of it is readable on a KindleforPC application The content of the book is firstrate I have several works in this series and although I may not always agree
I do always appreciate the integrity and the overall quality of the scholarship Based on content this would be a fivestar review
but you have to call attention to the serious failings of the publisher somehow and a bad review is the only way I know to do it
I needed this book for class and it arrived fairly quickly and the condition of the book was just as described I was very pleased
this is a biik it has words which mean things when you look at them in order it is referred to as reading some enjoy it Im somewhat undecided on the whole idea of the thing but hey your call
and an appendix The introduction gives an historical and textual background
and outlines the philosophical approach of the authors The appendix has some further remarks about a new version of the Analects found in a Han tomb in 
and more ruminations about Chinese language and philosophy When I bought this book I was a bit skeptical about the subtitle A Philosophical Translation  What kind of hybrid monster would that be What would made a translation philosophical Is this like saying a deep translation or an insightful translation And what does this choice of subtitle mean for other translations on the market Are they now
after reading the philosophical introduction
whatever their cultural background
I find two muddleheaded academicians spouting nonsense about the basically substantive and essentialistic nature of the English language sometimes generalized to all IndoEuropean languages versus the more eventful
relational nature of the Chinese language If you just squint your eyes a bit
philosophy gets in the way and leads the writers to use some very awkward new terms
I didnt find special merit in this translation compared to earlier translations by others The language often seems clumsy without need Especially clumsy if you know enough classical Chinese to see that the original is pretty straightforward and seems very natural As an example
to then repeatedly  thats in my eyes just clunky and wooden a source of  the original merely has is this not pleasant Compare this with the old Legge translation  The Master said
who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him The last line in Legges translation is quaint  after all
this translation is more than a  years old
Background Over a couple of decades time I planned to read the scriptures of the worlds great religionsphilosophies I started with my own
the ethical and philosophical system derived from the mans teachings this volume filled that void The book consists of a lengthy Introduction pages The Analects are then presented in  books the Chinese text is presented alongside the English translation Appendices take up the remainder What I enjoyed most about this book was the Introduction The authors go to great lengths to explain the times that Confucius  BC lived inthe government
the family structureand the language of classical Chinese This is most important to understanding a people
and how they build their civilization We in the West know that the Orient is different the authors gave me a better understanding of why For example
in classical Chinese there are no words as there are in English foramong othersfreedom
autonomy The authors write None of these English words has a close analogue in classical Chinese p  Let that sink in I mean really sink in Freedom Liberty Choice Individual Reason Autonomy If you dont have a word to describe something
Chinese thinking was worth the price of the book The Analects themselves are stories of Confucius wanderings in the countryside and his sayings on what he thinks is best for proper government
from the emperor down to local rulers down to relations among family Thats about it But it provides great insight into Chinese thinking The text at times is rather dry and straightforward Dont expect Confucius say nonsense It doesnt exist Read this book for the great introduction it is to one of the worlds great and largest philosophical some would say religious systems And also for the keen insight it provides into the Chinese people and why things are the way they are Whats past is prologue Sept 
Politics by Perry Link The first sentence of the review Link focuses on how Chinese syntax is to a great extent ordered by speech and sound and not by the kind of grammatical logic at work in many Western languages He scrutinizes the ways in which certain Chinese words take on metaphoric meanings The book has a price tag of 
Confucius has been much maligned since he is perceived as wanting a static rigid society This translation attempts to show that that is not really true The translators and editors explain in the foreword that the Chinese language is dynamic
no doubt The fact that Europeans and North Americans have not been taught to read the Chinese alphabet or the language
the  page introduction to the Analects is surely relevant as the author justifies himself
of some choices in terminology as compared to other translations and the works of previous tranlators A read here on Amazon didnt understand how an archeological find could bring higher understanding of these classics from Ancient China Well
no doubt For  and change
This translation questions the traditional translations of Confucius  ideas Ren usually translated as humanity here  becomes authoritative conduct which is closer to Confucius  original meaning of the word
which was noble conduct Another  unique feature of the translation is that the key Chinese characters are  highlighted as they appear
directly in the English translation This is  probably not the first choice for someone unfamiliar with the Analects  because it is somewhat technical
but its a must if you are looking for a  deeper understanding of the classic
The only translation that is a pleasure to read for both its language and its profundity  Ames and Rosemont bury the stodgy old Confucius and introduce us to a vibrant thinkerthe kind of intellectual magnet that  attracted hundreds of followers in his own time and millions throughout  history  Although their choice of translation for key Confucian  terms may seem unorthodox
consider where our orthodox translations have  come from They have come from translators with a knowledge of the  Classical Chinese language but all of the built in presuppositions of  Western Christian and essentialistic thinking including
 DC Lau  Since the standard translations Legge
there have  been great strides in understanding the philosophy of Confucius time  Ames and Rosemont are not only experts in the language but are at the  cutting edge of ancient Chinese philosophy  This book questions many basic  presumptions about Confucius philosophy and deserves thoughtful  consideration
Daomonkeys reviews exhibit detailed knowledge in Chinese philosophy
and I agree with many of his criticisms But he has made a small error in his review of this book
a philosopher who has published extensively on topics in Chinese philosophy You will find little by way of speculative acrobatics and obsolete wheedlings here The unconventional nature of the translation may seem awkward at first but repays careful reading Ames and Rosemont provide good arguments in the introduction for adopting them Also
is indeed a fine translation with much running commentary
I got to know this book thanks to my English teacher who studied
under MrAmes The introduction part of this book is very compact it is full of insights about the development and formation of Eastern philosophy
engaging and interesting As an Asian myself
I could explore further into my personal interest in EasternWestern comparitive philosophy
together with refreshing yet faithful translation of Lun yu
which is about the most  misleading choice Ive ever seen The notes and discussion
and the original Chinese text is included Pinyin romanization
The philosophy of Confucius is nothing like todays analytic philosophy Confucius
because he was busy trying to push his disciples to get up and follow his example He provides the deepest insight to his readers when he is most cryptic Attempting to translate this into modern English at all is a difficult task
as if we were dealing with something as complex as Heideggers Dasein Confucius was never trying to be complex or inscrutable  he was trying to smack down the glibtongued sophists of his day and encourage virtuous behavior Except these translators dont believe that ancient China had a concept of virtue
instead translating the single word ren as the impressivesounding authoritative conduct Every mealymouthed replacement of a simple commandment with an obscure philosophical hypothesis distances the reader from the text and accomplishes the opposite of what the authors of the Analects were aiming for This exact sort of behavior was ridiculed by Confucius in verse 
not the kind that is a petty person Very philosophical My version Confucius said to Zi Xia Kid
attempts to shove Western philosophy into Confucius mouth UPDATE I am eager to announce I have finally found a translation of the Analects that meets my needs My lengthy review can be found on its page
with a careful study of the rules that make up the fabric of an ordered society Its not his fault that the interpretation became too rigid as  happens
a classic of Oriental philosophy Even if you prefer Daoism this is still worth a read
I wish I had shelled out a few extra dollars and bought this excellent translation in hard copy This bilingual edition includes the original Chinese text traditional characters but the visual appearance of the characters is ruined in the kindle edition by extremely offputting graininess and pixelation Unless the Chinese text is of no interest to you at all
you should buy the paper version So disappointing The more simple characters
but more intricate characters such as  just look like squarish blobs Worse
so some short passages have huge but grainy characters
especially in the phonetic romanisation of Chinese terms Dont rely on the text of this kindle edition if you are citing it in an essay Do your eyes a favour and buy the real book
The printing job on this book is atrocious  It is completely shifted upwards making it awkward to read
are selected passages from the writings of an author I mention this definition here because it seems that the only time we use the term analects is when we consider the writings of Confucius Was there once a larger corpus of writings from Confucius
the same way we have a good many books from classical Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle but that being said
I certainly am glad that we have the Analects as a distillation of Confucius philosophy His Chinese name was Kung Futzu
I learned many things that I found new Perhaps because Ive been reading a good deal of classical Greek philosophy lately
when I heard Confucius reflect that In his errors a man is true to type Observe the errors and you will know the man IV
p  And in one of my favorite passages from the Analects
p  Readers who are interested in the JudeoChristian philosophical and moral tradition may be struck by the ways in which Confucius disagrees with one of the primary moral imperatives of Christianity In contrast with Lao Tzu
I found that I was particularly interested in one particular example of Confucius advice to his disciples Be sure to go carefully into the case of the man who is disliked by the multitude Be sure to go carefully into the case of the man who is liked by the multitude XV
and good advice in any modern nation nowadays I had this edition of The Analects with me when my wife and I were traveling in Beijing
home of the second largest Confucian temple in the world Walking in the Forbidden City
a textual history of the book
and Saint Thomas in the New Testament This Penguin Books edition of Confucius Analects is a very fine way to acquaint
oneself with one of the most important books ever written
as it does not contain a truly coherent philosophy or even a consistent mode of presentation or authorship
it was nevertheless an incredibly rewarding study And I say study rather than read because while it is quite brief  pages there are a wealth of chapters that will leave you ponderingin a good way If you are worried about the stereotype of vaguess and aloofness in Chinese sages
you neednt fear The Analects The main thing that can obscure some of the chapters is their reliance on Chinese history and most of these are briefly cleared up in Dawons notes The Analects can be picked up and put down at a whim due to the informal structure and you will never feel that you lost the flow of it should a few days pass between readings While I cant compare it to another translation or the Chinese
I found Dawsons translation to be very smooth and highly consistent throughout
and he supplements the introduction with helpful notes on his translation of key terms This is an edition primarily for the newcomer rather than the scholar not to say it is in anyway dumbed down as it is wonderfully concise in its introduction and notes
and there is a nifty conversion chart included in this edition This edition like all of the newer Oxford Worlds Classics is neatly designed with a beautiful cover and good quality paper
Confucius  The Analects is a rather intriguing book since it aims to tackle information regarding the well known Confucius in a cogent manner The book is laid out in a fairly straight forward approach with no frills thats an extremely quick read Within the introductory section
while a tad later on the book features notes on particular translations that the book offers  Knowing how complex translations can be
this book has dozens of them Reading this book will certainly help the individual realize how the culture was at the time
and why the information presented here was so vital to the upbringing and society in ancient China The totality of the book is seamlessly interwoven to give you everything you need for comprehension
I bought this version of the Analects together with Penguin Classics I think this one is closer to the original text
an interpretation is already in place and part of the magic and wisdom lost I think the best option is to read both
the similarities and differences are enlightening If you have to pick one
The Analects are widely recognized as one of the foundations of Chinese civilization  Understanding them from a Western perspective is
difficult There is simply no genre that the Analects fits into within the Western canon  Add to this a wide panoply of characters who the neophyte will find it difficult to keep track of and the reader may be left with only remembering some of the more familiar adages of Confucius This is not meant as a criticism of the text  It is just that a casual perusal of the Analects is not possible in the same way that one could read
Greek mythology There are no gods and only oblique references to anything supernatural Perhaps the practical nature of the text is one reason it has endured for over two thousand years I am not trying to discourage anyone from reading the AnalectsI just think that a more complete scholarly guide than is present in the Oxford Classics edition may be necessary to truly appreciate the work Casual readers will probably be most struck by the difference between the Analects and ancient Western legends and retain some of the sayings that have parallels in Western ethics  Anything more demands much more engagement with the material
it is almost a streamofconsciousness collection of gnomic utterances from a variety of characters mostly Confucius presented with little in the way of context or chronology  It works more by recursive themes
and unexpected free association So its kind of like the way we experience the reception of insight in real life
which is one of the things that makes this a masterwork worthy of repeated study  Indeed
I think this book is only profitable if reread and reread I would say the same of Lao Tzu and the Bible I find this Penguin edition to be a great choice for the first reading experience DC Laus introduction and notes give the firsttime reader enough context and background to read this work with some understanding and admiration
My interest in the Analects was to get a comparison between it and the Bible and the Koran The Analects was shorter than I expected I had to scan a lot of  the masters advice to his students to get the underlying message which is the same in the Analects
I feel like I should have paid more attention to the reviewers who felt just like I do It seems to be rather boring in so many occasions But I felt I had to read it personally There are a lot of similarities in his teachings and the Classical Hellenic Philosophers I wonder who learned from whom But it does not matter Teaching Ethics and Honorable Action by leaders is worthy to every one Anyone listening today in Washington Please read it and i might help you
years ago There are no doubt many different versions and editions of The Analects in English translation The one I am reviewing is the ebook edition from Open Road Media
even if you habitually read philosophy
it is difficult to just pick up a copy of The Analects and extract the wisdom contained within it In form and structure
the Western text that most closely resembles The Analects would likely be the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius The Analects is divided into  books
most of which are only a sentence or a paragraph long Some chapters consist of a few brief numbered passages Like the Meditations
there is no discernible order to these chapters for the most part they just fall where they may While each individual chapter can be studied for its own merits
youd really have to develop an intimate knowledge of the book as a whole in order to understand all the connections between the various chapters and form a complete picture of Confucian thought Though the teachings of Confucius form the basis for the Chinese religion of Confucianism
the philosophy of Confucius is really a secular philosophy that concentrates on ethics and politics rather than any metaphysical worldview Confuciuss teachings were intended as training for scholars wishing to enter public service and work their way up the bureaucratic ladder of government He also
and personal happiness that may be relevant to anyones daily life Some of the advice on governing may be applicable to the political and business worlds of today
but Confuciuss emphasis on knowing ones place in the social strata is unlikely to be embraced by ambitious Western individualists There are some similarities between The Analects and the stoicism of Marcus Aurelius in their advocation of resigning ones self to the reality of ones place in life While the Stoic attitude might be simplistically summed up as
be the best servant you can be Just as the first book of the Meditations refers to a number of ancient Roman personages that the average modern reader is unlikely to be familiar with
some of which seem to require prior knowledge of the characters mentioned Whats a Westerner to make of such passages without detailed explanatory annotations There is relevant wisdom in The Analects if youre willing to dig for it
but rather than reading the original text most readers would probably be better off consulting a textbook that explains the teachings of Confucius in an orderly and accessible manner
This book is really insightful and contains all of Confucius teachings plus information on Confucious by the author which is really helpful to understand Confucius ideas I ordered a used copy as it is more economic plus it had highlighted notes from the previous user which aided in spotting important phrases
Inexpensive way to review Confucius and hopefully get insights on China which was heavily influenced by this man I note in his writings an emphasis on the individuals responsibility to his master boss
Philosophically and morally sound advice from a historic writer  This is one of many books on my lifetime reading list now complete
One of the most famous philosophers in history is Confucius  This text covers various quotes and conversations with Confucius and his  disciples  Since many of the sayings are spoken in mystical parables and some of the thoughts might  be lost in translation
this is an important text for anyone who is interested in the many wise sayings of Confucius  This book is broken down into what it calls ten volumes Volume one covers fundamental principles and government  The second volume discusses manners
Highly repetitive I didnt feel like I got the character of Confucius I was disappointed Perhaps I should read a book about Confucius to find out more about his teachings
but its big enough to change your life D
with plenty of explanatory notes  My sentiments lie with Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu
but it is worthwhile to study Confucius as well
Arrived on time and in immaculate condition
Came in Excellent Condition I was mostly interested in this version because it has a very beautiful and artistic cover
this man was a marvel it all boils down to do to other what you wish done to yourself Too bad few people care to follow sage advice from those who came before us
The Amazon review system for this book seems to think its some kind of novel Hilarious
with a few good notes
I have not read other translations but this one is understandable and a good read
Oxford did a phenomenal job in the organization of this historic work Confucius is undoubtedly one of the most influential men to have walked the earth
and The Analects is a work that all libraries should encompass This book includes additional notes and insights
and is a great size to carry around with you
The book arrived in perfect condition and is exactly what I thought I was buying Just ensure you want this particular version of this famous piece and you cant go wrong
Confucius is worth reading for anyones first eastern philosophical literary experience
A smooth translation
excellent reference book
The Analects are crucial to understanding the culture of China For this reason we use it as an anchor text in our documentbased core course on the history of civilization This edition is the most helpful I have seen It is a good
smooth translation
This is an incredible collection of teaching on wisdom and virtue two of the most important things in life by a man who spent his life studying them and passing them on to his disciples  There is a great deal of truth to be found in these pages
Not the same as equivalent paper edition No Chinese characters side by side  Will this electronic edition improve
not a very good translation of the old classic The style is rather awkward only get if youre an enthusiast
good translation good gift for english reading friends who want to know more about Chinese philosophy
Great teachings and learnings from a true man of wisdom and virtue
and i enjoyed this edition very much it had an excellent translation
My nephew has gone off to college this year and some of his books were so expensive we were lucky to find some of them here on Amazon and at a way better price than a retailer Very pleased with the books we were able to find
which can provide valuable insight not only into ancient China
and excellent answers are given
or translations of common Chinese salutations etc can lead to some confusing moments
An interesting translation I have found it important to read more than one translation because ChinesetoEnglish requires just that Simple inflections change the meanings dramatically
I had to purchase the book for a college class but decided to keep it after it was used  I enjoyed reading it and find early Asian philosophy interesting  Sadly
the book is difficult to read on the first go through and will require a couple readings and focus to get through it
Great book Had a little damage to it though Perhaps damaged en transit
I needed this book for a class It came in great condition
definitely worth its price
Great book Gives insight into deep thought and chinease culture Highly recommend this book for people who want to expand their understanding of Confucius and the impact he had on China
the condition listed that it was very good but it was really a fair to me Some of the pages in the pack were tearing I bought this book for 
An example of publishing at its worse No attrubution of the translator
no prefatory material
none of Laus appendixes if indeed it is his trnalation It is a piece of crap The binding is chep
the cover is the sort you find on cheap kids books Caveat emptor
Returned  didnt realize new translation differed from work of which giftee asked
but not soemthing worth keeping as a reference tool or hierloom  Has some pen marks and notes in it
I dont mind  Incredible cheap
seller did a great job
it is worth serious study I reject but many admire  To study you need a very good edition This is it Brief
as the story of Chinese culture if fascinating and
enlightening Master Kong still controls much of the thinking of the present Communist Party of China Decide for yourself about the merits of the philosophical teaching
but this is an excellent book for study Repeat much of the work is fragmentary
but the way its written is very comprehensive I found other Confucius books that were more of an easier read
and notes very helpful in understanding the main text The Analects are rather disjointed
with no overarching organizational thread running through the passages They are also rather dry They lack the poetic quality of
the following quote by Confucius appears three times Make it your guiding principle to do your best for others and to be trustworthy in what you say I also appreciate the sentiment that correct behavior changes over time
do not be afraid of mending your ways  It is not the failure of others to appreciate your abilities that should trouble you
The Analects contain twelve books I to XX each with around  to  numbered paragraphs Confucius believed a leader that acted virtuously without resort to punishment could govern a country Confucius lived in the hundred philosophers period  BC Two other prominent philosophers in that period were Mo Tzu with Consequentialism see my review and Han Fei Tzu with Legalism see my review  Many of Confucius ideas are similar to Mo Tzu
Te and Wen The author presents in the Introduction such a summary of  pages of the  Analects text  pages  My recommendation is to read the analects before the introduction and determine what you think is relevant to day  Confucius presents ideas on how you should think and act I  have selected a few of the paragraphs about government and the way to act that I hope  will encourage you to read the analects  XIIQuestion What would you think if I were to kill those who do not follow the way do what is right Answer
What need is there for you to kill Just desire the good yourself and the common people will be good The virtue of the gentleman is like wind the virtue of the small man is like grass Let the wind blow over the grass and it is sure to bend  II Guide them with edicts
to seeking advice when he is in doubt
and to do what is right at the sight of gain   IV The way of the master consists in doing ones best and in using oneself as a measure to gauge others  VI Yen Hui was eager to learn Unfortunately his allotted span was a short one and he died Mo Tzu concluded from this last paragraph that Confucius was a fatalist  All three philosophers believed that the ancestors were living in heaven and watching their descendants and interfering in what happened on earth Elaborate funerals were held to show respect Confucius supported rites and elaborate funerals Mo Tzu said
if the officials sincerely desire to practice benevolence and righteousness and to benefit the people of China
they ought to adapt moderation in funerals as a principle of government  The paragraphs also show that Confucius believed that it was possible for leaders to govern by acting virtuously and skeptical about the use of laws and punishment as advocated by Han Fei Tzu II
Nassim Taleb writes about how time is the ultimate test for the fragility of ideas So with China on the rise
which are said to have been recorded by his disciples What Ive found is that Confucius was very good at understanding how to get the best out of hierarchical structures
which today would equate just as easily to corporations as governments So Ive picked out the best bits for business and modified the language to sound more contemporary Basics of working An overarching principle to work by is do not impose on others what you yourself do not want Someone who constantly learns will not be inflexible Avoid overpromising and underdelivering Money and status Money and status are what everyone wants
then to complain of injustice when poor The good leader is at ease without being arrogant the bad leader is arrogant without being at ease Dont worry if you dont get the job title you want  worry about your qualifications and ability to do the job Dont worry that no one appreciates your abilities  try to earn their appreciation Dont blame others for not seeing your talent
blame yourself for not seeing their talents Managing others Surround yourself with people that are better than you The leader enters into transparent partnerships
and say you dont when you dont Five things will make a leader great respectfulness
noone would act unethically even if it carried a reward If a leader acts correctly
Theres no doubt about it Confucius was a wise guy If youre looking for quotes about virtue or really anything read this and Im sure youll find something I found it interesting that certain values that arose in other parts of the world also arose there in China
There were a fair number of sayings in this book that seemed pretty irrelevant or impenetrable to the modern reader
even halfway around the world
Book  Im not certain how many of my complaints are due to the actual text
and how many are due to having a cheap translation with few notes
I found this to be a fascinating book because it presents a perspective on social morality and the obligations constructed around having a family and a duty to the society you live in Im not sure if the translation is as accurate as it could be and there were times where the subtlety of the subject matter escaped me
likely because Im not from china nor do I really have an accurate understanding of the culture in Confuciuss time
I found this book fascinating because it presents a different perspective on social responsibility and morality toward the people we interact with I highly recommend reading it as an opportunity to expand your horizons both culturally and for social responsibility
many of the sayings have their impact undimished by time In each book consisting usually of about  pages there would generally be at least two or three sayings that struck me as truly meaningful and pertinent Naturally
but that is to be expected in any text which is so old If one is able to mine the gold from the rocks
Analects of Confucius can be quite a rewarding experience However
I found the introduction and essays in the back of the book to be superfluous and felt that they did not shed much additional light on who Confucius was or what his teachings meant
The Analects of Confucius is one of the most influential books ever written anywhere Although I cannot read the original Chinese
this remarkably lucid translation makes me feel quite close to the source The translation makes a point of allowing some of the dazzling fragments in the Analects to remain just that without trying to smooth them out artificially This is important as it allows the modern reader to appreciate the complex texture of an ancient text on its own terms Both the introduction and the endnotes are quite helpful in elucidating some of the difficulties and the ambiguities in the text encountered by the general reader Additionally
the size of the book is perfect It is small enough to carry anywhere Overall
probably more popular than thewitty Lao Zi Confucius said his teachings were connected by asingle thread  While a disciple gave a slightly different solution,the thread I suggest you follow through this otherwise ratherdisjointed collection of teachings and observations is humility  Bythat I dont mean selfabnegation or loss of individuality in thecollective
this kindof integrated humility is the starting point for any worthwhilephilosophy of life The Analects can also be of value to peopleinterested in the critical study of the New Testament
as recorded by the early community of followers  Fewscholars doubt the historical character of the Analects
whilecontroversy about the Gospels makes headlines on a regular basis  Itis interesting to me that the same internal arguments scholars likeCreel and Lau use to prove the Analects
youmight try the further experiment of comparing Confucius ideal person,sage or Savior as Confucian scholar Chen Jingpan describeshim
and the price is right,but his language is a bit archaic at times  Also
be sure to get aversion with notes Author
this deep and old wisdom is best taken in small bits for not many words are wasted  Also
the Lionel Giles translation I read was weak on supplemental commentary so I really felt like I needed a more knowledgeable guide as I was reading  Perhaps the Norton version would have better annotations then the beautiful Easton Press version from my library  It is clearly a five star book
there is not much point in buying this book for the text of Lunyu itself it is available in full on the Internet for example at Wengu   in the Chinese original
illustrates his arguments with quotations from the actual Analects and tries his best to relate Confucius philosophy to suitable analogues in the Western tradition I am no Chinaexpert
so this helped a lot The book also has a postscript outlining Kongzis life and a short piece on the individual disciples and friends that Confucius converses with in the book I think there is  of value or whatever the price in this book
I was reviewing when I found this book on Confucius I have always been a fan of his philosophy and way of thinking I like the fight and the believes he had in his times while others were more like following the troups and status of the dynasties It was the wild west of the ancient world
so I cant say how accurate  the translation is
Its amazing how after so many years Confucius thoughts are still important Here you can find the basis for most of the later philosophists
This book contains the essential antiquities of ancient learning that fostered the development of the philosophies in the west in a clear
easy to read format I was amply impressed by the organization and  translation
and doubly impressed by the fantastic price I would highly  recommend for anyone just curious about philosophy
This should be required reading for everyone by adulthood  It gives you a unique perspective which no educated person should be without
The quality of printing of the book new I received was rather poor  I kept it just because I didnt want to go through the trouble of returning it
An interesting book with some thoughtprovoking quotes  i dont know about other readers but it was a little confusing for me
joined with a length introduction and notes on the key Confucsian teachings
Excellent quality and smart edition Love my book
this is another book I bought for my grandson going to university and according to him its an excellent edition of it which hes very pleased withI was pleased with the usual efficient service from Amazon
Arrived in time and a great book to read and quality is good
Some interesting points to think about  The style is a bit rushed and abrupt
Excellent translation with a great introduction
I trawled through it with a highlighter and regularly go back and reread the lines which mean the most to me Some of his ideas can change the way you think and act towards others for the better if you take them onboard and apply them in your life This book would also be good for anyone who appreciates inspiration books like Art of War for application in management situations The ideas may be able to help you better understand
The book is considered as the Chinese Bible throughout the ages and widely read Confucianism
as an orthodox philosophy
is based on The Analects The book is a collection of Confuciuss wisdom compiled together by his disciples These teachings are still relevant as selfknowledge and pursuit of virtue are ageless themes Now about the quality of the book This book is awfully produced to say the least This is a Penguin Classics edition and they just failed themselves to do justice to their fame From the font selection to the quality of pages
everywhere a careless attitude is prevailing The translation is up to the mark but the book has missed it
Books from this edition are great nofuss books and theyre super cheap This particular book however I found a bit harder to read because there are numerous references to individuals
Ancient taos daos Daos taos I dont even Are the best self help books Most self help books are nonsense marketing titles Confucius is a genius
The Analects contain twelve books I to XX each with around  to  numbered paragraphs Confucius believed a leader that acted virtuously without resort to punishment could govern a country Confucius lived in the hundred philosophers period  BC Two other prominent philosophers in that period were Mo Tzu with Consequentialism see my review and Han Fei Tzu with Legalism see my review  Many of Confucius ideas are similar to Mo Tzu
Te and Wen The author presents in the Introduction such a summary of  pages of the  Analects text  pages  My recommendation is to read the analects before the introduction and determine what you think is relevant to day  Confucius presents ideas on how you should think and act I  have selected a few of the paragraphs about government and the way to act that I hope  will encourage you to read the analects  XIIQuestion What would you think if I were to kill those who do not follow the way do what is right Answer
What need is there for you to kill Just desire the good yourself and the common people will be good The virtue of the gentleman is like wind the virtue of the small man is like grass Let the wind blow over the grass and it is sure to bend  II Guide them with edicts
to seeking advice when he is in doubt
and to do what is right at the sight of gain   IV The way of the master consists in doing ones best and in using oneself as a measure to gauge others  VI Yen Hui was eager to learn Unfortunately his allotted span was a short one and he died Mo Tzu concluded from this last paragraph that Confucius was a fatalist  All three philosophers believed that the ancestors were living in heaven and watching their descendants and interfering in what happened on earth Elaborate funerals were held to show respect Confucius supported rites and elaborate funerals Mo Tzu said
if the officials sincerely desire to practice benevolence and righteousness and to benefit the people of China
they ought to adapt moderation in funerals as a principle of government  The paragraphs also show that Confucius believed that it was possible for leaders to govern by acting virtuously and skeptical about the use of laws and punishment as advocated by Han Fei Tzu II
stolen from the Bible and twisted to fit asian wisdom from a common man Waste of time and boring
there are great footnotes in this version of The Analects
and extensive further reading material at the back of the book in addition to a very scene setting introduction Itll be a quick read therefore buy it from a cheaper supplier
Words of wisdom are profound and timeless indeed
not expected this quality from Penguin Classics
No need to say that this book is excellent but paper and print quality is not up to standard
having purchased many classics at once I am not a stranger to reading philosophy odd
can be summed simply he promotes wisdom and benevolence as the chief sources of happiness in life To Confucius
or are rich Becoming a gentle man to twist the translation to show its etymological implications is
but I picked up and read this over a long period of time a large break
and would on the rest of my journey throughout the hours muse on them
think on their wisdom The less helpful passages are ones which are not as applicable to a secular
having served in government himself in his younger years
so too would be their people DC Laus edition is thoughtful
particularly on corruption Something I did not note until I was near the end of the book was the very helpful glossary of names after the main text
wisdom and sticking to his principles are refreshing Most importantly to this review
Id recommend The Analects to anyone who perhaps wants to immerse themselves in one of the significant roots of Chinas culture
and to immerse themselves in their own mind and thoughts Often the most favourable interpretation of a saying is best be open and respectful to be Confucian and these sayings will help you as they certainly did with me I only wish I had the volume here at university
page quality is not good
Always useful to have a copy to read when you have five minutes or so Great introduction explaining the context too
Other than in passing reference I am new to Confucius body of work and The Analects have been an excellent place to start  D C Laus introduction lays excellent ground for the reader to understand and put into context The Analects  It is this introduction that makes this translation stand out from others I perused before purchasing Having read through once I now use this book daily as a reference of useful and practical principles  Much of the guidance given by Confucius is as relevant today as it was over  years ago  In the spirit of Confucius
I would recommend you apply his teachings as part of your own personal quest to self discovery to improve the world around you Ahead of his time
politics and relationships with other human beings  In a society where ego is usually a guiding principle of success
If you are interested in philosophy or just want to see what Confucius really said
This is a very good Everyman edition of Confucius Analects
with Arthur Waleys invaluable introduction  Although the dustjacket was missing
the book was in good condition and I am very satisfied Essential reading for those wishing to understand China
This book is a collection of insights from Confucius over his lifetime seperated by periods It is good that there are no interpretations only translations People purchasing this book should be aware of this as it is a difficult read with depth of understanding required beyond that of a scholar Good choice to read
This is a really good translation
it is a good guide for how to be a gentleman Where it falls down
I realized the the issues related to the human factor issues is real and last from few thousand of years Its comforting from a certain point of view
only translation Im looking for the the bilingual edition The book is light and not very big
Im interested in most things of Chinese culture  history and am curious to find out more about Confucious  havent read much of it yet 
This book is extremely fragmentary The text is corrupt in many parts and that is acknowledged by the writer It has more to do with the life
servants  It is okay as a book but you get the feeling that a completely new and revised copy needs to be produced And where passages are inscrutable
but has merit as a good work of philosophy and summary of eastern culture
Nassim Taleb writes about how time is the ultimate test for the fragility of ideas So with China on the rise
which are said to have been recorded by his disciples What Ive found is that Confucius was very good at understanding how to get the best out of hierarchical structures
which today would equate just as easily to corporations as governments So Ive picked out the best bits for business and modified the language to sound more contemporary Basics of working An overarching principle to work by is do not impose on others what you yourself do not want Someone who constantly learns will not be inflexible Avoid overpromising and underdelivering Money and status Money and status are what everyone wants

This version was translated by a ChineseAmerican scholar who had moved to the US when she was  so the English was perfect and easy to read She had a lot of added commentary which gave you a very complete and understandable look at the times Confucius lived in She used other Chinese commentators on his work to add to the readers understanding He lived in turbulent time and I found his advice and admonitions to be relevant even to a st Century American
particularly hoping to get some glimpses of its present state by seeing its past Confucian thought has been a driving force for many years so I dabbled in this book As usuall
yet it still is amazing to see that basic human needs and wants rarely change I wonder if the ancient Egyptians had something similar
There are many English versions of the Lunyu Analects but this is arguably the best The  English is lucid but the outsatanding feature is the annotations that explain much that would be obscure to general readers and even sinologists whose expertise is on later periods If you are curious about Confucius
this book now makes perfect sense
but by no means an easy read The format of the book is a compilation of sayings attributed to Confucius
followed by analysis by the books translator Chin Anping  A clear strength is the updated translation
coupled with a more updated and correct understanding of the proverbs and sayings  The works primary focus is upon moral character
but an essential one for understanding Chinese views on morals and principles
the first one got lost upon delivery This book is important for philosophy in general
but this translation by Annping Chin is the best of them all Why Because it is complete
her translation and annotations bring the sentiments of the great philosopherpractitioner and his students to life Secondly
this work features both the English translation and the original Chinese text for crossreference Confucianism is a philosophy that has many interpretations
this is the first choice text for understanding and important aspect of Chinese culture and receiving guidance for your own life
Very good interpretation by this translator
Well received in good condition
This is the first half of C H BrewittTaylors translation of the thcentury Chinese classic I am reading his translation in parallel with Moss Robertss translation While I am unable to judge the comparative accuracy of the two renditions
as a reader I considerably prefer Robertss translation
primarily due to his extensive and illuminating endnotes Lacking the information in those endnotes
I think I would have been unable to appreciate the narrative The one respect in which I prefer the BrewittTaylor translation is that he inserts paragraph breaks when the text switches from one speaker to another He also adopts a somewhat more archaic prose style than Roberts does
which may appeal to some readers though not me as suggesting the storys venerable age The original Chinese novel was penned over six hundred years ago
but many of whom would have been known to its original audience Reading a chapter again allows me a sense of what it would be like if I wasnt trying to remember who everybody was and which faction they supported Although this is slightly undermined by the two translations using different schemes for transliterating Chinese names I will postpone comment on the books quality as a story until I eventually make my way to the end PS My rating of  out of  stars is as much a rating for the translation as for the underlying story
and I may well end up giving the Robertss translation a higher rating
This review doesnt really concern the story  Romance of the Three Kingdoms is justly a classic piece of literature
and itd be slightly ridiculous to review the story itself on an Amazon review Its amazing
and definitely read it if you can What I will review  and what I have significant problems with  is the Tuttle edition for Kindle I cant really speak on the printed edition
which leads to my next point a lot of the prose is pretty bad
but its at best annoying and at worst a serious impediment More than once Ive had to stop and ask myself who is the subject of this sentence or even who is the direct object which takes me out of the action while I have to parce the previous paragraph and see who the translator is talking about The register of the translation changes as well  one second a character might be speaking in a very formal
its an awkward sentence  why phrase it like that It seems pretty obvious that the translator was probably not a native speaker  which is fine
WG has its issues here as well  Kongsuns Kong is not pronounced as in King Kong There are a number of reasons why it would make a bit of obscure linguistic sense to write it that way for romanization purposes
ssutu is situ or Minister of Education Its worth noting that the edition didnt even get this right ssutu would be sidu in Pinyin
with the positions generally not elaborated upon The worst part is when the book half does this and half doesnt Commissioner X told Y Ssutu note the Chinese syntax for titles suchandsuch Some titles are fully translated and some arent  so were hearing Empress Ling tell Tung Taihou Dowager Empress something It then switches Overall
INCREDIBLY confusing for a book that has so many important interludes in the highly stratified court So we have a confused usage of ranks some English
My mother in law recommended this book Its a great read to learn Chinese history from a fictional book
This is a great work of literature
and this editions introduction is a great transition for the Western reader into the right mindset
I would definitely have enjoyed it more if I could follow the characters The characters are numerous and have VERY complicated and some similar names
excellent reading material  fiction historical of background China dynasty  very interesting
Its AMAZING I love having background on favorite games of mine and this is Dynasty Warriors I also love Asian culture and this book is fantastic
very historical and insightful A little difficult to keep track of the all the story lines but I enjoyed it 
This book came is in excellent condition and looks like it will be a great read I bought it for my husband for Christmas and I know hell be very excited to read it 
Excellent love factual history
This version of the book is  horrible
stilted translation makes it tedious going Storyline evolves is that the right wordwanders along
too much Chinese structure to this extremely predictable story
in a way a picaresque epic across the whole of China during the Han dynasty of the empire
when that empire was at risk because of internal strife and the incapability of the emperor to keep things under control
by his own fault the own fault of several emperors one after another and inability of building some kind of government that could be reliable
transparent and noncorrupted And that is where the book is amazingly revealing This empire is quite obviously a feudal empire Power is in the hands of governors appointed by the emperor in each district The governors are appointed for what these people did for the empire
and there the difference between serving the empire and serving themselves is not always clear Ambitious people can climb to the top in no time and then impose their power The decomposition of this empire started when the various feudal lords or lordlings started considering the eunuchs
who were provided by the emperor with the full control of the government because the emperor is lazy in many ways and looks for an easy way to control such a big empire
and because the emperor is incompetent technically ignorance of a lot of things necessary for government and psychologically unfit to exercise such an enormous power He then relied on the eunuchs of the empire
among others to become the top officers of the empire The most famous eunuch along that line was Admiral Zheng He who had been castrated at an early age because he was a Muslim and he became the top man of the Chinese fleet before it was dismantled by the Confucian Mandarins when they took over around  These corrupted eunuchs encourage all kinds of outlaws to go around in the country and raid cities and farming areas to their own profit and to the shared profit with local supporters of the eunuchs A rebellion came from the various local or regional lords who had the power and the means to raise armies They united and finally succeeded in getting all the eunuchs eliminated and executed
but the main military force was in the hands of an ally of the local and regional lords
an exoutlaw who shifted from raiding cities and farming communities to raiding the central government by taking control of it The empire is then at stake because it explodes into rivaling cities and provinces and the central brigand controlling the empire spreads and increases his power by taking control of rebellious provinces This is typically feudal Power is in the hands of the stronger person
and stronger means military force and nothing else Then this power is only a way for those in power to loot the country by levying armed forces and taxes for their own profit Then the emperor can even be chosen
but for how long Thats the beginning of the saga but that explains the whole saga feudalism was the real social and political architecture of the Chinese empire The main originality is that there was no spiritual or religious authority of any sort that could set some criteria and norms for everyone and keep the whole empire unified by some kind of spiritual allegiance
officially nonChristian and to be Christianized That started quite early after the fall of the Roman Empire and later on the fall of Charlemagnes empire who only fought against the various Asian tribes or military forces trying to penetrate Europe from the East and against the mostly Muslim Saracens trying to do the same from Spain And the emergence of such a spiritual force took a lot of time The book was written after the takeover of the empire by the Confucian Mandarins and we could wonder if it is not a reflection of this evolution in the th century that inspired the author to show how bad it could have been before when the empires unity was endangered by internal strife and its unity was rebuilt later on by the leaders of the three kingdoms We have to think of the other great saga of Chinese literature
a saga whose earliest extant copy is traced to  and is the story of a Monkey that travels to the west to discover the famous Buddhist scriptures that found the Taoist approach of life that developed in China as the spiritual guideline of the empire and can be considered as the basis of the Confucian Mandarin takeover in the th century That is rather amazing to see this empire evolving from a purely feudal state with a marginal Taoist presence seen more like some witchcraft than anything else
the most impressive one in the whole world at the time
vastly centered on the China seas and the entire Indian Ocean and that would have been  capable to defend the empire against the European invasion that was still to come when Admiral Zheng He died The result was a total closing up of the empire onto itself
particularly the tool of its power was destroyed the various commercial routes known as the Silk Roads You will find all that in these books and it will make clear that the present commercial policy of China to reopen and redevelop the various Silk Roads is the only way for China to develop and recapture its past greatness Will this policy reestablish some feudal state Hardly conceivable Will it establish some hierarchical centralized and unified system in the whole country and beyond Thats also a dubious unrealistic view China has to open itself to the world but that will not lead to the looting the English
or at least one of the beating hearts of the global world using its commercial power rather than military force That should bring you to wondering if the use of military force is not a feudal way of looking at the world and trying to dominate it You may come to wondering if president Trumps approach of the world is not a feudal way of looking at the problem in total opposition to and contradiction with the Chinese commercial approach of president Xi To conclude I will say that Chinese literature
is always centered on this problematic of the whole world in development and the choice between three possibilities  pure military force and a feudal system  pure spiritual closing up onto themselves and their protected own resources some Confucian hierarchical architecture  a general commercial vision that brings economic development to the world modern sharing resources via some global free but regulated marketplace Just get into this saga and enjoy the action and the treacherous ways of most of these feudal lords Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
Romance of Three Kingdoms is a part of East Asian culture It overtook the heart of both Chinese and Japanese as well as people in Southeastern Asia In Japan even younger generation who rarely read literature enjoy the story in the form of either comic books or in popular PC games In China many of the Chinese Opera plays come from the part of this story Every Chinatown around the world has one or some GuandiKuan Ti Temples such as those in Nagasaki
Kobe and Yokohama The story is based on the history of ancient China around late nd century to late rd century when the Chinese continent was divided by three strong kingdoms
and Zhuge Liang Comic book adaptation by Mitsuteru Yokoyama who is best known by the author of Iron ManTetsujin paved the way for current three kingdom boom in Japanese pop culture in general Liu Bei
is a humane leader supported by Guan Yu
deft both in brain and might maybe eastern version of Knight
and Zhuge Liang the master of strategy Rivaling Lie Bei is another giant Cao Cao outstanding ruler and historically known as one of the finest compilers of Sun Tzus Art of War Cao Cao courting the emperor Xian nearly took hold of the whole Chinese continent but was blocked by the allied forces of Wu and Shu in  as the dramas such as depicted Cao Cao is a bit demonized in this story but he is in fact one of the greatest rulers China ever had comparable to Napoleon Lie Bei who has little power gradually gains by charming a lot of talented people by his couteousness yet with propaganda tactics to demonize Cao Cao  Cao Cao soon recovered from the defeat of the Chibi battle and with the finest staff collected from the whole continent he sought to break the alliance of Shu and Wu After the death of Cao Cao
Guan Yu and Zhuge Liang are still loved and idealized by Chinese public On first reading you will be enjoying the way the characters outsmart the other camps On second reading you will be struck by the humanity upon which the story is based It is much more than a legend It will surely get you closer to the mind of either Chinese and Japanese But be careful The way character name is pronounced differ between Chinese and Japanese Such as Cao Cao is pronounced in Japanese as SOSO  Now I must add a few things for newer k fans who encountered this epic through koei games Koei adopts Pinyin system for three kingdom character names and pinyin method has almost subdued English speaking community Brewitt Taylor uses Wade system differing so much from the way the character names were currently spelled For example Cao Cao is spelled Tsao Tsao As you can see older system is useful in pronunciation ideas Verdict Excellent translation getting you much closer to this Chinese epic Mustread for chivalry novel fans Rating  out of  A bit cut by spelling confusion as I mentioned Recommended for the fans of Sun Tzus Art of War
This is an older translation sometimes it opts for pseudomedieval vocabulary
it uses the WadeGiles system of romanizing the Chinese names rather than the pinyin one more often used these days The newer translation by Moss Roberts probably reads better and has more apparatus
but is not available as an ebook This ebook does allow one to read the Romance in English on your favorite Kindle platform
so that quite aside from the Chinese names English words come out misspelled on a regular basis You can almost always emend the garbled reading
The story is truly a classic and the translation is pretty good  However
the actual product is pretty sloppy  Volume one was less problematic than volume two
but both had a high number of instances  The main problem is that letters that are similar in shape
as apostrophes get pretty regularly left out  In a translation system where an apostrophe is the only difference between the names to two characters or places
entire words are left out pretty regularly  I wonder if any highly fluent English speakers actually got to proofread this
It is a well made TV series based on this classic Characterization and acting are all excellent
I am especially impressed by the period costume and the set
or classical books  Note This translation may be somewhat confusing to some people because it uses the more oldfashioned WadeGiles spellings rather than the more contemporary Pinyin System  If you were introduced to the Three Kingdoms through the multiple video games that are out,as I was
it might take a little extra thought on your part to understand who is who as you are reading For Example
or the Qin dynasty as the Kwin dynasty The BrewittTaylor translation uses the old Wade system
the reader gets a sense of at least the rough pronunciation Cao Cao is rendered Tsao Tsao
BrewittTaylors translation is nice to listen to Empires wax and wane
the complete rainstorm of names is daunting indeed Always keep in mind the three separate forces Cao Cao of Wei
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is one of my favorite novels Unfortunately for this version
it is quite difficult to become accustomed to it I would recommend a WadeGiles translation of this novel On the plus side
so readers gain the full experience of one of Chinas great literary classics
It was a great quality and fur exceeded my expectation I would choose used book next time too  It is not only economical but ecological too Thank You
I enjoying reading it except the following problems  Typos are almost appeared in every  pages  Stories are not link between paragraphs There are pages that I have to read  times in order to picture what is going on and who and who die How about describe more about the heros when introducing them like
Wow Volume  of  I believe and I was initially very confused about the pronounciations and spelling of the names of the characters before I realised I was thinking in a very Eurocentric way
without taking into account the fact that the translations within are probably more accurate than those in the console games that have developed from these accounts However
this is an epic historical piece
rightly broken down as thew weight of the entirety would be too much to lift The story of the fall of a Dynasty and the turmoil that followed very much engages
but for readers used to modern writing
its really quite difficult to follow a plethora of characters with names so similiar it takes ages to realise whos who Id say only for enthusiasts of classic asian literature
Very good story The English is not very perfect but I liked it too
Got this for the great reviews and the fact its awardwinningbut who edited this Ive read  page novels with intense dialog between  characters simultaneously without typos or grammatical errors I honestly am not trying to pick this book apart
but saw  before I even got to the actual translation Perhaps Im OCD
I also get the impression Im expected to buy many of the authors other books to fully understand Sun Tzus concepts
the editing in the introduction is fairly sloppy Not enough to dissuade me from purchasing this text
This work is based on many years of study the original Chinese and teaching the its strategy worldwide Although its a small mistake
I noticed two other grammaticalpunctuation errors in the first three pages Grammar pains aside
Im going to give  stars for the actual book and  for the kindle edition The publisher should have made it clear that is not a kindle but just the book scanlated
If I had scanlated the book page by page for personal use
though not too awful far into the book He is irritated that he has to put it down to read other things for his schooling The best thing about this purchase is that I overheard him discussing the book and its some of the strategies with his Daddy the other morning rather than talking about the usual morning chit chat Thats a good thing Hes thinking beyond the usual
the author did a good job on the translation
Worst printing quality I have seen The paper and Ink quality is very bad  probably like many other  made in China products
This book can help anyone in a crisis  It teaches you to be calm  It teaches specific strategies  Highly recommend
I ordered this for my  yo son as a Christmas gift I read it before I wrapped it Very interesting Full of useful information that can be applied to every day situations I know hell love it
I like to provide material that stimulates your mind My son wanted this book and I was happy to purchase
what makes the text brilliant in the first place This is an unorthodox review I will say
easiest translation to read and actually understand Course Im a Redneck so words over two syllables do tend to confuse me  Bottom line
this book is great and contains the original Chinese and how they translated it just in case you wish to interpret the language in your own ways for a deeper meaning in a sense because words in Chinese can often have many meanings and be interpreted in multiple ways What I did not like in particular was the occasional suggestion cropping up throughout the pages that in order read some of the extra art of war material
I did look but couldnt find any that were in English  and  for fast delivery
Nicely done The arrangement makes the translated text not only easier to understand
but allows the reader to comprehend the Chineseness of the text and therefore provides a much fuller comprehension of the tactics and philosophy of Sun Tzu
dont buy this thing Its a  page outlined and bulleted version Amazon is starting to annoy me with crappy vague representations of the products sold The product description for this book is several paragraphs long but fails to mention this is not the actual book Now I have to take the time to return it
but this thing is TINY Its basically a hyper condensed cliffs notes version
it encompasses the subject of conflict more than actual military war  It was meant to be as useful to a mother trying to get her child to go to bed
as it is for a general about to engage in a troop movement  This is not actually a terrible version
Very misleading description and title THIS IS NOT THE FULL BOOK This is an abbreviated
 page recap of some of the chapters takeaways Its my fault for not looking at how many pages the book was before ordering but it should clearly say in the title and description that this isnt the complete book Disappointed with misleading information
you can make an A out of you and me well I did it to myself To be fair the description DOES say  pages I should have known better None the less I put in a request to return this item as I have no need for  pages of bullet points UPDATE I received a full copy of the text and I went back to reference this text ONLY A FEW CHAPTERS WE CLOSE TO SIMILAR lots of different verbiage and it looks like the text was changed up to someones interpretation DO NOT BUY IF YOU WNAT THE FULL TEXT Thank you 
While I am partially to blame for ignorantly forgetting to read reviews prior to purchasing this product
it is also deceiving I always try to read reviews to ensure what I am buying is legitimate and a worthwhile purchase This is not the full text of Art of War
and it is never stated as being anything less Upon receiving it I was disappointed immediately when I saw the size While I did read it in about  minutes
its about war  But Sun Tzus strategies for war work amazingly well in business and any competitive endeavor  I bought a copy of this book to pass along his wisdom to a new high school graduate  The format of the books is highly accessible and an easy read  I have other copies of the book with additional notations and explanations  Theyre fine for background research
but I like this version for quick access to Sun Tzus insights
A quick read that supposedly teaches skills needed in management or on the battlefield Know your enemy Never completely surround your enemy Treat your army as you would your children show them love
related to their academic major or not After I compiled the list of books for the class I went online and ordered all the books from Amazon I placed them at their seats prior to class and allowed them to enter the room wo me being present for the first five minutes It was
one of the good teaching moments of our time together Thanks for helping me fulfill a need in their soontobe military career
Sun Tsus principles are timeless wisdom that can apply to many walks of life  A great addition to your collection  I keep going back to mine again and again
It is easy to see why this material transcends through history
 and applies to military tactics to this day It is also very easy to see how the philosophy of Sun Tzu serves as inspiration for so many martial arts as well Im glad I finally got to read the whole thing
the narration was surprisingly bad  The narrator misread many words throughout the book  It was as if the narrator did not have adequate reading skills because they would say words completely different from what was printed  This was confusing because the words the narrator said made no sense in the context of the sentence  This made it so that i couldnt just listen to the book
i had to instead continually make sense of the narrators mistakes
The brochure is a waste of money and time Its written entirely through numeric points that mostly make no sense The sentences are written in very simple language
which could be either from the original author or a result of the translation The described tactics are merely common sense
nothing surprising or extraordinary The Art of War in this form of brochure serves at best to stabilize a wobbly table
so I thought it would be a safe buy  This is only some odd abbreviated version of the book Its a waste of money
I simply read this because I wanted to see what it was all about It is a classic and has its place among Beijing in the most important ancient texts all g with the bible I read this for fun and did not analyze or pick it apart I recommend read it if you are into these kind of books
This could just be my air but I always thought this was a large book and this thing is a paperback pamphlet size of a Jehovah witness brochure For the price I guess its not bad but I was expecting a book
The book is a classic and there very little to be said about this that has not been said by more experts on warfare then this reader I recommend it to any person that is considering a career in the military Volumes have been written on how to conduct military operations but in this case less is more
in this small book is a wealth of experience and knowledge that translates into the present state  of modern warfare The shame is that many in the military that have read it cant seem to utilize the lessons to be learned that are clearly expressed in it
Read it Put it to practice Highly recommend this book for anyone looking to achieve victory Power overwhelming Godspeed mortal
there was no way for me to return it I am sure the summaries are accurate and do provide a good synopsis of the text
Book is ok but only provides a brief summary Table of contents does not correspond to any pages
I purchased two versions This one is the real deal Only if you are waging war is it relevant However
Ive heard about this book for many years Its easy to understand why so many professionals beyond military Admirals and Generals apply Sun Tzus principles There are many concepts that have application in sports
and politics I love how it gets tight to the point Very refreshing
Bought it for my girlfriend and after reading it she was inspired to go demand a k raise Now I stole it from her and Im feeling ready to do battle
the copy I received was a little torn at the bottom of the first page
This is not even  of the whole book  This book is maybe  thick  The real book was at least an inch thick  Ive seen the real deal in bookstores after purchasing this  Well played
 but Im sure not giving it a good rating
This is an outstanding reference and handbook for strategies in war
competition and personal growth  A treasure chest of ancient and timeproven advice
no worries Ive read it before but I lost the book and wanted it for my collection
This is not the entire book I dont know why it doesnt state that in the description It has good information though I keep a few copies to hand out to people for reference use
segmented advice that is good not only for war but for life Really quick read
The description was not clear that this is just basically a bullet point summary NOT the full book I didnt read the reviews
The ultimate handbook for anyone involved in competitive business
finance Really a great read and should be on the top  books any new businessperson should read
This book is the defacto standard for studying battle tactics Its also a great book to study as a business owner as well
This version or translation is worse that the Kings James Translation of the Bible
The large surface area with so few pages makes it a bit frustrating to keep in good condition for long
although overall its presented very well Not bad for the price Recommended for your first time reading or a copy you can take anyway without worry
I thought it would be a lot bigger and in depth  book but its like an outline
I didnt know exactly what to expect from this book This is as much of a philosophy book as it is on the stratagem of conducting a war No battle scenes or gore A quick read
he had read a part of it at uni but is now happy hes read the whole book
A good translation
Fascinating strategies Some concepts and strategies are even useful in situations we see at work and personal life I really enjoyed it
My husband has wanted this book for a very long time Good price and fast service
The best way to describe this is the Cliffs notes of The Art of War Product is deceptive in the description Thought I was getting the full book Disappointed
Classic strategic planning
Its a summary of the original version I like it
Very sparse translation I got this for a college class
and thankfully I had another version Theres no translator credited
and then the very basic translation It actually came in handy when the other version of Art of War that i had got a little too verbose I was able to refer to this one to get it dumbed down a little
Book arrived in good condition
It is basically just a listing of SunTzus principles The cover art pictured was not what I received I got cover art that just stated the title Bookseller was good to deal with regarding this issue Wish the book had some analysis or explanation or examples No introduction verbiage nor back cover nor chapter verbiage
A very affordable price for a reprint of a classic  It is much appreciated
Feel deceived I was a very abridged version
It is a must read if you like reading books old enough to be considered historic
nice translation
Like the easy read format
I am currently still reading it im half way through it Its a great way to see into the mind of a great warrior
My minisynopsis This book is quite literally a guide filled with tips on how to go to war It was written by Sun Tzu who was a Chinese general in the Eastern Zhou period The book gives very specific actionable tips on how to be sure that your army will win a war It has become very popular in the business world because many of the tips for war can be translated to be helpful in running a successful business It is a very short read but is a great look into the mind of an extremely successful general
and gives great advice on how to build a successful army Whether you are looking to win a war or win at business
Opportunities multiply as they are seized What I learned I learned many tips on how win a battle using fire and spies but even more about how to run a business The point that I found came up the most was to be unexpected Never use the same strategy twice if you are trying to beat someone In terms of how to handle competition
this is the best least aggressive strategy I found Never do what people are expecting or you give them plenty of time to determine how they will defeat you Additionally
a point that stood out to be was how tactics are like water You cant expect for a strategy that worked in one market to work just as well in another Use it as a guide then be aware enough to allow the strategy to react to its surroundings
like water down a mountain The final point I will make is a point that I have seen mentioned over and over in many books from most of the successful leaders sans Jobs of course Treat your people well He specifically mentions that before disciplining them or pushing them too hard
they must fully trust you and be attached Once again I am reminded that leaders lead by example which gives everyone the faith to trust them Great quick read and now I feel like I need to go buy a samurai sword
and has inspired President Donald Trumps business strategies This book has also changed me in some vital ways Here are a few of them First
I am able to use my energy so much more effectively by applying some tips from the book For example
  and avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak This book has also helped me in my day to day life I have learned how to manage my time and to prioritize what I use it for This helps me to prevent from getting overwhelmed with work I would recommend this book to a person who is willing to change himself for the better
and who is willing to put in the effort to read it and understand it to its full extent A couple of major questions raised by the book are Did Sun Tzu ever even write the Art of War Many historical facts suggest that Sun Tzu was not the original author and Is The Art of War fiction
or realistic fiction We will never know the book combines various genres and is subjective to the opinion of the reader Sun Tzu spoke in complex and diverse riddles about war tactics
how to be a great leader
and more His voice sounded wise but commanding and kept me hooked throughout the book I wanted to keep reading the book
with a wealth of knowledge and strategies that can be adapted for use in conflict ridden or adversarial situations in daily life  This book is just as relevant today as it was centuries ago
only that it is public domain I do not believe they are following copyright laws even by stating just that Look for a modern translation with a known author
This book is really a blessing to me It really helped me a lot when it comes to important decision at my work and in my job that will matter the most in the future I learned a a lot of new perspective when it comes to strategic planning
Thank you for this amazing addition to my collection Definitely recommend this seller  STAR
Not the full version Very thin book
A classic Pristine condition
Great common Sense is a great thing especially if it went through history and is still teaching valuable lessons with all that weve been through,good job Sun Tzu 
and the content on the pages is arranged into points with significant white space between each one Maybe look up some images of the book to give yourself a better idea of what youre paying for I personally find the points can be a little hard to digest
I have read the book before in its physical format This ebook is not the full version of fhe book as it is much shorter  pages the full book is more than  pages This product does not mention this fact anywhere Scam The real full book is really good Just buy it from another provider
If you can appreciate when this was written then you will understand the historical value of this book A worthy read and a good place to start if you like war history
excellent Ifvyou like strategy yiu will love thus  Took  mins to read
happy purchase
and this is a great little text Not as detailed as the other book I had
still with good application to modern times teaching a military mind
Those interested in politics can learn from this
those that are interested in warfare need to understand it even more
Interesting and intriguing  Applicable ideas and philosophy to other areas of life and relationships other than just war strategy
Dislike being forced to write a review while reading the book Destroyed my train of thought for no good reason
Not the actual book Dont spend your money on this
Great perspective Very applicable for anybody who is looking to improve in sports
The book came in excellent condition Packaged well from seller I would highly suggest that when reading this book that you find a quite place to read it  You will want to emerse your entire focuss on the story and absorb all info Its not the same read if your being interrupted all the time Its a great quite time reading book you will get allot out of I loved it and its now going on my coffee table I will most definitely read this book again Everyones perception of this book is different so therefore thats why i suggested a quite place to enjoy the book Hope that helps and enjoy
but I do not like the translation It seems a bit to simple
