Caution Although it is listed as a different version of the same product the 
Kindle edition is literally a comic book version of this
 The page is misleading as it lists Moss as the translator and the length as  pages
 When you download the eBook you get a  page comic book
I was able to return for a refund but this absolutely NOT what the page would lead you to believe.
Ive read Moss Roberts other translations for Journey to the West and Outlaws of the Marsh
 I tried a different translation for Romance of the Three Kingdoms done by BrewittTalyor as well
I prefer the Moss Roberts version because 
It comes in a  volume set unlike others 
It uses the modern pinyin for names vs
WadeGiles e.g
Zhang Fe vs
Chang Fei Cao Cao instead of Tsao Tsao which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class 
There are maps I got really lost trying to followalong with the BrewittTaylor version Lastly Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the nonfiction history of the  Kingdoms period
The  classics of Chinese literature are indeed long about  pages but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter where one book is  pages however they are amazing reads
If you could only pick one then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the  for a western reader
 If you are going to read all  then start with Journey to the West then go to Outlaws of the Marsh then to the Three Kingdoms
FWIW  Kingdoms is packed with adventure intrigue tragedy and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture
 Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor
I had a hard time putting these books down and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well.
This is Moss Robertss translation of the Mao version of the Chinese classic Three Kingdoms a highlyinfluential historical novel that covers a sweep of over a century from  A.D
to  A.D
encompassing the fall of the Han dynasty and the ensuing struggle between the resulting three kingdoms as signaled by the books opening sentences Here begins our tale
The empire long divided must unite long united must divide
Thus has it ever been
The authorship of the novel is traditionally attributed to Luo Guanzhong writing in the fourteenth century over a millennium after the novels events
Complicating the novels history there were at least two main versions of the narrative a print edition from  well after Luo Guanzhongs death and a subsequent major revision of this dating from the s
The version from the s edited by Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang father and son is the dominant one and this is the version that Moss Roberts has translated
The novel is episodic very lengthy and has a vast cast of roughly a thousand characters over a hundred of which Moss Roberts classifies as major characters
The original audience would have been very familiar with the storys heroes who were the subject of popular stories and plays that predate the book
I however was entirely unfamiliar with the characters and the historical period and would have struggled to make sense of it but for Robertss extensive and very helpful notes
Even with the notes I found the book an effort to read
While I cannot exactly say that I enjoyed it I am glad that I read it
The scale of the story is epic men scheme and betray each other factions vie for control of the empire huge armies  sometimes of over a hundred thousand soldiers  battle
The book also reminds me of Chinas long history of civilization
Despite dynastic struggles such as those shown in Three Kingdoms Chinas organized bureaucracy lasted for millennia run by highlyeducated officials and helped by the invention of paper
The book raises questions of what makes an ideal ruler an ideal minister an ideal general and includes many instances of ruses and clever schemes
The novels opening chapter includes the swearing of an oath of brotherhood between three heroes Liu Bei known as Xuande Lord Guan and Zhang Fei in a peach orchard
The scene is renowned yet I found it underwhelming as I likewise found other famous moments in the story underwhelming
The lengthy story never once brought me close to tears I never came to love its heroes
If I had the stamina to reread the whole book perhaps this would change
Knowing what lay ahead having familiarity with the characters the events might have more emotional weight for me
On my first reading I was interested rather than moved
And the initial impact of the novel for me was bleak kingdoms fall and rise cruel and selfish individuals may prosper heroes are imperfect everyone dies women are largely relegated to the sidelines
A handful more assorted comments...
Firstly I read this in parallel with BrewittTaylors  translation and I considerably prefer Moss Robertss version both for its prose style and for its invaluable footnotes plus an illuminating onehundredpagelong afterword
Secondly as the afterword clarifies the book drew heavily on historical records but amended and added to them so that one scholar Zhang Xuecheng later characterized it as seven parts fact and three parts fiction
Thirdly this edition includes occasional illustrations which I welcomed though their reproduction quality was sometimes poor
Fourthly the book contains many fantastical elements portents and sorcery and ghosts
Fifthly the book contains a fair amount of poetry.
If you want to understand Chinese strategy read this
Research has shown we are influenced heavily by the stories of our childhood
The Three Kingdoms is a well known tale in China not so much in the rest of the world
If you want to understand Chinese strategy negotiation and leadership  look at the examples that children were taught in this book.
Its a challenging read for those of us who didnt grow up with these characters and stories but if you invest the time and make good use of the excellent Moss Roberts annotations you can get completely absorbed in it
After working at it for a while picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again all of a sudden I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies
In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of small print and annotations in even smaller print
I have to use a magnifying glass to read them
Eventually I bought the volume larger format set put out by University of California Press
The print is larger but still small  but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself.
The books that I got has a few issues
Ive only looked through the first book at this moment but I saw that names and words are randomly misspelled throughout the whole book
Also the text is slightly offcentered on the page like its slanted
Its as if someone had placed it on a scanner in a crooked way
I have screenshots of this attached notice that the Character Yuan Shao is spelled as Yuan Soao and that the margin gradually widens throughout on the right hand side
I expected higher quality control that this
This is not acceptable.
In AD  the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus Emperor of the Romans was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states
One included Gaul modern France Britain and Hispania modern Spain another Italy and North Africa and the third was based on Palmyra ruled by Queen Zenobia
In  Aurelian reunited the three kingdoms and reestablished the Empire
It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt about  AD and it also broke up into the Three Kingdoms of the title
Is there any significance to this parallel The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations rather astonishing in view of the distances involved
At all events this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together
For the Englishspeaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern unadorned English
To me the names all seem alike a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters However the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain Cao Cao
Hes the kind of man who hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an allys house breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife
Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig He rides away meets his host coming in the other direction and decides hed better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known
Hes the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience
The books  volumes in paperback cover a period of several decades with numerous marches countermarches sieges and battles including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of  men on  fleets of ships and on land
Thats the Battle of Red Hill
While it can be a little tedious because its so huge the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature
While theres a map alas it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map
The historicity of the story has been questioned with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction
Apparently the author who first published it around the year  was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives
Some of the characters are real people but its clear the story has been doctored at numerous points
Also the Foreword which is extremely helpful although its scholarly and not written for the general reader says that a second author recast the plot around  to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty
Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so its hard to imagine how the original text treated him
So dont learn your history from this book Its just entertainment and however good the Archives were the authors were working a thousandplus years after the event
Its not history
A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new Peoples Republic of China PRC official transliteration scheme where Mao TseTung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing
Therefore any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and peoples names are spelled differently
Of course literature from a foreign culture that doesnt use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme and the PRC one is meant to reproduce more closely the pronunciation used in one of the main dialects of Chinese Cantonese or Mandarin
Despite these caveats Three Kingdoms is a work worthy of your time.
Bought the digital version for a cheap price of 
Story quality is fine the technical aspects make it hard to read
It only shows one panel at a time at low resolution
The Kindle PC app doesnt allow maximizing and justifying so the panels are like  in size
I had to manually reduce windows resolution very low as a workaround
Using a surface for vertical aspect ratio doesnt help much either.
This is a review for the  volume set translated by Moss Roberts published by Foreign Language Press and sold by Great Wall Bookstore
It has  chapters or  pages the only unabridged version translated by a native English speaker who has been furiously studying Chinese history and language
I had purchased the ebook version and was disappointed to find those to be incomplete
I bought them as a gift for my bookworm hubby since he was hoping to get into some Chinese classics
This book set has helpful footnotes providing enough contexts and also figured and maps
We compared this translation with the more recent one translated by Yu Sumei and edited by Iverson
Together we concluded that Moss Roberts translation is more elegant.
Ive heard many stories and references to this book growing up it is kind of nice to actually read them for myself
 Unfortunately I cannot read Chinese at all so I had to rely on finding a translated version
I came across and attempted a BrewittTaylor translation a while back but could not finish the book through that version
 The names of all the people and the way it read did not quite flow as nicely for me
 This version by Robert Moss is fantastic
It reads nicely and is full of notes and annotations that provide a much deeper understanding of the story history and of the book itself
The quality of the books are nice the text is not to fine or big to read
 I am tempted to now shell out the extra  bucks for the hardcover editions
 I was only a bit disappointed the shipping of the product which seemed to damage it some
bent or crushed a bit on edges
The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale but the quality of this specific collection
You should note that the author Luo Guanzhong had a strong bias for Liu Beis Shu Han and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment
Pros  This translation of Luo Guanzhongs masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful
Youll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight
 Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period
The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong the period and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang
Cons The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves
 There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just werent edited out
Ive never seen so many mistakes in a book before
 The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to so bath tub readers BEWARE the pages dont recover from drips damp fingers or hot humid air
That said as long as you treat them with the care due any book theyll last just fine
Ive read through my volumes three times and theyre still in very good shape.
I just want to offer my opinion about this edition the  volume box set printed in  I believe it is 
 The story itself is a fantastic engaging read
 The language is fluid and I am finding that it is a lot less dry than I expected and so it is very easy to get through the book
Deciding which edition to purchase was my biggest problem but so far I have no issues with this one
 While I read some reviews about spelling errorsand indeed they do existthey are not at all frequent and detract little from the story
 I also read that the characters names occur in three forms creating much confusion
 Again I find this to be untrue
 In fact the narrative will often clearify who is who for the reader so you are not pondering over names the whole time
 Sometimes a character will be referred to in their style
 I dont know what that means in Chinese its probally in the footnotes somewhere but the style is seperate from the surname and given name
 Most characters styles are never used except upon introduction so its no issue
My advice to the reader who has never encountered the story I have played the games and done some preliminary research on the era is to read up a little on the history of the time
 Start with the end of the Han through the Three Kingdoms period and this will at least give you a foundation for what is going on
 It will also familiarize you with some of the names and the important players who ruled at this time
The only thing this edition could use are some good maps
 Being that it is a box set a few seperate inserts that can be referanced along side the books would be great but they dont have them so what can you do
Overall I am not at all dissapointed and highly recommend the Chinese Classics edition for the serious reader.
if youre looking for this you probably already know what it is
it is fast paced beautifully written and an amazing story
 the tapestry of legend and historical fact is well enough woven to give one a sense of what actually happened while having a few over the top events
because there is no english translation of the annals of the three kingdoms this is as close as an english speaking person is going to get to understanding the period
if the number of characters is overwhelming the dynasty warriors series of video games actually serves as an abridged version that helps to identify the major players in the ocean of hundreds of characters.
First of all this is a classic of Chinese that is relatively unknown in the west
 This epic could be considered the Shakespeare of the Chinese language
 It depicts the decay and collapse of the Han dynasty
 In the process of this decay the nation is split into three kingdoms which stuggle for supremacy
 In the process of this struggle we find tales of friendship heroism betrayal and tragedy
 This novel has thousands of characters but perhaps the main character is Kongming the military strategist of one of the kingdoms
 Its a pure pleasure to read his elegantly executed strategies
This translation has a modern feel so it was easier to read than other translations that I have read
 Robert Moss does a good job of making the story flow
 However as some other reviewers have said it doesnt have a poetic feel
 While the story has been translated it is always difficult to translate literature into other languages
 Having said that I think this is an excellent translation for those who want an easy read or those who are reading Three Kingdoms for the first time
 Also I strongly recommend an unabridged version such as this one
 If you read an abridged version the story wont seem well developed
 The full text is necessary
 I especially recommend this novel for those who are studying politics military science or business
 Youll learn lots of strategies for living life.
I bought this because I needed something to read while at work I went through nearly  dollars worth of books in one month buying single volumes
A month later Ive not quite finished it still on book  near ending and being a romanticized historical it is amazing really brings you into the world and its setting
Got some time Got some money Buy yourself this set honestly an amazing read and will be donated to my local library when I am through with it
THE SET   This is a good set if you simply want a copy of the book
Paperback and four easytomanage volumes
  This is the Moss Roberts translation
So youll get the names and spellings you might be more familiar with  like Cao Cao instead of Tsao Tsao
  Its also a good set if you plan on buying other Chinese Classics like Outlaws of the Marsh or Journey to the West because they all have uniform editions
  The only possible negatives are since they are somewhat condensing a really long novel into four thinner volumes the actual pages seem a little thin
I worry from time to time about ripping them
  There are also a number of typos
But in all honesty I dont really notice them
With the story moving along so quickly and the presence of alreadyforeign words and names a typo now and then wont make you stumble in the least
THE BOOK   Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a really great albeit long story
This is the fictionalized story of a real civil war period in China that occured after the Han dynasty fell
The names places and major events were all real
The heroic actions dialog and minor events however are mostly imbelished or improvised
  But despite the length and complexity of the story there are literally hundreds of characters this book is a GREAT read
Because it has so much content to cover the book moves at an incredible pace
Characters are literally fighting andor dying every other page
Although you may get confused by the names you will not be bored by anything
I often get bored by books but everytime I pick this one up I am sucked in instantly
  And if you have played any of the Dynasty Warriors or Romance of the Three Kingdoms video games you should most definitely read the original tale
Plus you may have a head start on the complexity from knowing some of the charactersevents already
  If youre at all interested in ancient warfare drama or literature you need to read this book.
First off..
I wont waste your time in writing a review on the Three Kingdoms  Im assuming that if youre reading this review youre already aware of just how importantincredibleenjoyable this novel is
 Truly a great entertaining story and yet so many lessons can be learned from it
 Its no wonder why this is so widely taught in most Asian school systems
I will however comment on this specific volume package
 This is arguably the best packagedset available at this time for those that want to read the novel
 Its not a collectors edition  theres no leather binding or any other highend detail associated with it but rather it is a simple and convenient set
Unlike other versions being sold it is somewhat smaller I believe the dimensions are already displayed in the item details  so it is very convenient to carry around e.g
read on the subway train plane etc
 Its broken up into  volumes page numbers are continuous  so volume II starts on p and the overall quality is actually pretty good
 Its your typical paperback book
Prior to purchasing I read a number of reviews complaining of how thin the paper was and that it made it completely unreadable
 I did not find this to be an issue
 Yes the paper is probably thinner than one would expect..
but nothing where it poses a threat of being damaged easily or anything of the sort
 I also didnt find any issues with being able to see the lettering on the subsequent page as its shadow is visible on the page youre reading
 Yes its there and yes its noticeable especially when there a poem  as the poems are indented but again I didnt find it to be an issue
I debated back and forth on what version I wanted to purchase and I can honestly say that Im quite pleased with this purchase
 Its good quality its packaged nicely in a boxed volume set each volume has notes at the end  so no need to search for notes in another book as is the case with other versions its the unabridged version a MUST  please avoid any abridged version  as they often leave out so much and its affordable complete set costs as much as one volume of other sets
 Its also a Moss Roberts translation  something I would recommend
 And it also uses the pinyin Chinese translations more easily pronounceable  in my opinion
 Nice introduction good notes throughout etc..
so also a great option for those studying the novel
Simply put if youre looking for a collectors edition that youre going to hand down from generation to generation with leather binding handdrawn images color etc etc..
obviously this is not the set for you
 But if youre looking for an affordable compact convenient and accurate translation..
then this is the one for you.
Now that I finally finished the book I will say a few words about this book
 Its a long story and it took me over  months to finished it
 I did enjoy this historical novel which is said to be  based on history and  fiction
The characters in the book are more alive in the readers imagination than in the book itself because there isnt much character developement
 The book doesnt flow or read smoothly instead it feels almost mechanical
 But the events and the actions take a life of its own in the readers imagination
 I dont know the Chinese language but maybe there were some essence that was lost in the translation
The events and the strategy that were used in that era of history were brilliant
 Even though this happened hundreds of years ago I have to remind myself these people were not simple ignorant farmers
 Instead they were manipulative calculating and deceptive as much as if not more than the politicians that we have now
Of all the events in the book what I still remember is how people are killed so easily and at a whim of those in authority
 No wonder so many people were in fear of their lives and what they said and did because they were at the mercy of the authority
 Another thing I marvelled at was the scale of the wars and battles they had where hundreds of thousands of people would fight and die just because their king wanted ot attack their neighbor
All said I would reccommend this book for those who have some interest in China or that era of Chinese history
 I give this book  out of  stars because of the lack of the character developement which would have made this historical novel much more enjoyable and readable.
Anyone that has played the games or Dynasty Warriors should really read the books
They can be a hard read at times with the names but it is well worth it i have read them more then once and still i love them
There are SO many stories that the games never touch on that will just amaze you even farther about the beloved characters in the games.
The tactics of The Art of War is pretty much used throughout the book by many of the warlords
The multiple layers of military deception and feints gets so deep that it creates the oddest strategy of all Predicting that your enemy will anticipate a trap or deception and go the obvious route instead
Basically to sum it up
 China splits up into a dozen warring states and warlords
 The Mandate of Heaven seems to motivate the warlords to continue fighting thinking its heavens wish to eventually reunite China which probably keeps China from becoming like Europe with a dozen states coexisting
 The Art of War is known by nearly all the warlords all the battles are very tactical
 If youre interested in Game theory there are many complicated alliances breaking of alliances and betrayals between warlords.
If you have ever played any of KOEI Dynasty Series games then you are familiar with the Han Dynasty and some of the Chinese History
If you were interested in knowing more than what you did in the video games then this book is for you
This is an awesome epic novel sweeping the history of Chinese history
All of the characters that are in the Dynasty Series game are here for our further knowledge
Liu Bei Guan Yu Zhang Fei Lu Bu Cao Cao Cao Song Dio Chan Sun Ce Sun Quan Sun Shiang San....
the list goes on and on
This story written over a thousand years ago accurately portrays the lives and feelings of these heroes
The author is a little swayed by the Shu family and he seems to favor them portraying Guan Yu Liu Bei and Zhang Fei as the most loyal and honorable sworn brothers with Cao Cao a sort of evil madman
But that is okay since I never liked Cao Cao in the game anyway
All in all this is a long and worthwhile read
I would recommend the unabridged version as it is more complete and thorough
You will not be disapointed to see these wonderful characters come to life.
This is an awesome set
Complaints about how thin the paper is I find to be unreasonable
The paper is completely adequate  now the New American Bible  thats thin paper
The typos are slightly annoying but not too much of a big deal
The translation I find to be very readable
The material is dense and the footnotes are vital
The amount of information on even a single page is astounding and does not lend itself to a quick or passive read
Anyone who has read more difficult historical works such as Thucydides or Caesar shouldnt have any problem with the style
  Like most I became aware of this story through video games specifically the Dynasty Warriors games
The games were a good primer for the actual text as the reader already has mental images of the characters and battles  while the mental images of the characters conjured by the games may not be historical or accurate they lend themselves to remembering and differentiating individuals  which can be difficult for western readers because of the Chinese names which naturally seem foreign and hard to remember to westerners
I have always had an easier time with Japanese personal names over Chinese personal names When you start throwing in Xs and Zs in the translated names my brain just goes What Strange and unfamiliar Therefore the primer videogame course helped me immensely
  I do wish the box that holds all  volumes was a little more robust but for the price of the set I cant really complain
Overall very pleased
Now I need a statue of Lord Guan to start offering incense to the God of War.
The writing style is interesting though it is fairly obvious the tale was meant to make Cao Cao out to be the villain and Liu Bei to be the ultimate in compassion and goodness
 Despite that the stories are colorful and intriguing though it can be difficult at times to keep track of the names of all the provinces warlords underlings etc.
 Rereading helps to alleviate any confusion.
Whether youve been there or not Three Kingdoms will provide you deep insite into Chinese History and Culture
 Encapsulated in a Swashbuckler worthy of Hollywood it is a roadmap to over  years of a culture the West generally knows so little about
 Much as the tales of King Arthur portray Romanized Britain during the disintegration of Rome Knightly Brothers strive to preserve the Han Empire or carve kingdoms amidst battles plots counter plots seduction and betrayal
 These are stories that even in English translation show us as much about Chinese thought in the way place time and events are portrayed as can be gleaned from actual dialog
 Annotated Three Kingdoms can read on many levels from light entertainment to historic cultural education.
This page is completely messed up the three editions are entirely different The kindle edition is an English language comic the paperback appears to be an English translation of the Chinese novel and the hardcover is the original Chinese novel
It is a great book but the font is really small and they printed it wrong so the lines dont align too well
 If you want your eyes a little less stressed this isnt the book to get
 but plot is great
Regarding the four Classics of Chinese literature there is a popular saying that goes lao bu kan san guo shao bu kan shui hu translated as The young shouldnt read Water Margin while the old shouldnt read The Three Kingdoms
I did just the reverse as a teenager living in France I voraciously read Water Margins that depicts the lives of  outlaws I knew all of their names by heart and is supposed to have a negative influence on young boys because of its vivid display of violence and its apology for the overturn of the social order that made it a favorite of Chairman Mao
The Three Kingdoms was not available in French at that time
I discovered this second classic much later in a Japanese translation at an age when readers allegedly shouldnt be exposed to its depiction of stratagum deceptions frauds and trickeries that cunning politicians could use to their advantage
My dream is that when I reach old age and become conversant enough in Chinese I will be able to read The Three Kingdoms and Water Margins as well as the other two classics of Chinese literature Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber in their original versions.
The historic novel of the three kingdoms was a fantastic read
The literary style was at first difficult to get used to but the story itself is told in a very straightforward fashion and the characters are very rich
The constant turn of events will have you rooting for the splendid victories throughout ShuHans campaigns and lamenting their bitter losses
I noticed many typos throughout the entire novel but theyre few and theyre small enough to avoid confusion as you read
Overall I think this particular translation was excellent
It was recommended to me and I would gladly recommend it to anyone who has an affinity for this great age of chivalrous heroes and tyrannous villains.
A most loved collection for our kids growing up
Must have for the history buffs and strategy lovers.
Best translation ive read
This would be the third iteration of this story ive read
The names are spelled correctly with grammar and general spelling mistakes being far less in this rendition
The books physical quality isnt anything to ride home about
Pages wrinkle and warp easily with some text being blurry only a few pages
Came with a few pages already wrinkled too
Still highly recommended for someone seeking the best translation
This one even has a few pictures and maps
Get this one for reading and then find some special hardcover run for the shelf if you really like it.
Translation is good well I wouldnt know about accuracy but I didnt find it hard to read
As for the story itself keep in mind that this is a book of tremendous historical and cultural importance at least in China
If youre reading it because of that then youre going to get what you want out of it
However taken on its own in comparison to modern works the story itself is sort of meh at least in my opinion.
This book is EPIC
 This has to be one of the greatest stories ever told
 I would recommend this to anyone
 There are typographical and spelling errors every now and then but I mean comeon this is a  page book published by a chinese company its very good that there are so few typos
 Someone remarked that this was not a good version and advised to check your local library
 He must not know that this is considered the definitive edition of the book and one of the best unabridged versions out there.
After falling in love with the movie Red Cliff I discovered that its narrative was based on this classic chinese novel
And since this story is so ingrained in the East so as to be part of the culture itself I was determined to ferret out a copy and see for myself
This is a huge book it spans generations and took me months to read
My edition was smartly broken up into four books so I didnt have to carry around a huge dictionary sized brick I appreciate that
What I didnt appreciate was at the end of book four is a list of important characters their descriptions and even a list of titles with definitions
How is that offensive Well I sure could have used that while reading books one through three Being a westerner Im just not that comfortable with all of these chinese names and words some of the characters only differ by ONE letter Not to mention most of the main characters have more than one name used interchangeably
There are also a ton of characters many who will never appear again for me someone who is not good at names this was a bit of a trial
However Im glad I read this Im glad I own a copy and I look forward to reading it again one day
The story itself is impressive with ample amounts of action tactics political intrigue humor and even romance
I can see why this story has endured for so long
This was not an easy casual read for me but it definitely deserves its rank as one of the four great Chinese classics.

Best regards M
Nguyen
I purchased this a few years ago and when I came across the product again remembered this as being one of the best books Ive ever read
If anybody is interested in reading the Three Kingdoms this version is THE translation to get
And the notes in the back are very useful too
So worth reading over and over again.
Good
The books themselves were in good condition
No pages missing no tears or anything like that
BUT the product all  bucks smelled HORRIBLY
So bad that it gave me a headache while reading
Books are literally unreadable
Have tried many things to get rid of the smell and nothing works.
Ill be perfectly honest Ive never been one to actually sit down and read a book unless its been marked required reading
In fact my only fantastic literary claim up to this point was conquering the Harry Potter series
Then I picked up these volumes
I was absolutely enthralled
I picked up this book because Im a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series
In fact I just recently discovered that the games themselves were based entirely off of this collection
From then on I had a blast both playing through the games and reading the books trying to pick out scenarios and information the game had changed or in some instances just completely left out
In the process I learned something new about ancient Chinese culture and managed to have a fantastic time doing so
I highly recommend this book
And as many others have said do NOT buy the abridged version
Spend a little extra and get the four volume set
Youll get a lot more out of the reading.
Nice books
 I am reading along as I watch Chinese TV series on Three Kingdoms
 An exciting way to learn about history and Chinese culture.
There are some translation errors here and there for instance someone would be put to deach rather than death but other than that its exactly what you paid for
Better value and translation than the other books that are listed and youre getting the whole set of books instead of just one or two
I hate that I sound like Im trying to sell the book but really this is the best version you can buy unless you learn Chinese and translate it yourself.
Great book but poor editing
The translations and annotations are good
The terrible editing and textual errors make it a hard read.
For Americans
Is it the correct translation No but that is okay because a lot of people who buy this book will have done so from exposure to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games from Koei and they used the Americanized spelling that unfortunately doesnt match up pronunciation wise but the names are the same as they appear in all the games
I much prefer this as I bought a copy of the original translation and had no idea who the hell they were writing about
For those of us who got exposed to this one of the greatest stories about  true ever told having to go back and relearn all the names would be VERY taxing not to mention annoying as hell.
Ordered my complete edition of Three Kingdoms from this seller
Was very impressed
I got brand new books in a very short time frame and for a great price.
Initially when the books arrived I received a misprint where volume  was just volume  with the volume  binding
Luckily the seller was right on top of it  sent me a new copy of volume  with no issues  no headaches
It arrived promptly  in one piece
The only reason Im giving the series  stars instead of  is due to the heavy ghosting with the text in the books
All four volumes seem to suffer from ghosted text  it can get really distracting
The text from one side of a page bleeds through very noticeably to the other side which gives me a little bit of a headache when I read for an extended period of time.
An exciting if convoluted novel depicting an epic period of chaos in Ancient China
This novel is wonderfully translated and I cant imagine that was an easy job
Also includes helpful footnotes illustrations etc.
I have read and enjoyed Three Kingdoms for over  years
 I recently reordered this version because my last edition was getting worn
 This Moss Roberts translation is the best English translation of Three Kingdoms on the market and the introduction afterword and footnotes contain a lot of additional interesting historical information for anyone who enjoys the period
 This is the only edition of Three Kingdoms I would purchase or recommend for an English speaking audience.
My favorite work of Chinese literature rendered in very good Enlgish.
to become familiar with a Chines literature classic.
The Chinese Iliad that exults the strategist over mere warriors
Great quality Great price Highly recommended for anyone learning Mandarin or wanting some classic Chinese literature.
not finish reading yet
Love this book
Read it when I was in university and now bought to own and read it again
Cant put the book down.
The book shipped quickly and was in good condition
It comes in  volumes in a box
The page length is very long and the paper is the same type of paper than youll find in many bibles thin but good
This story is one that should be read and appreciated more widely.
I first became intrigued with the Three Kingdomss historical events when I played the game Dynasty Warriors  for PS
Afterwards I was desperately searching to find the best novel translation and finally bought the volume box set translated by Moss Roberts which is the UNABRIDGED versionmake sure to get this edition as it tells the whole story wo leaving anything out.I then set out to explore the  pages of Chinese history and I must say it was a fascinating experience
I initially grasped what was going to happen in time but there was so much other details to the story and idealisms portrayed
Leadership loyalty heroism military tactics and warfare treason and even romance play such a significant role in this epic novel
The empire long united must divide and the empire long divided must unite pretty much opens and closes the novel perfectly
Heroes such as Guan Yu Zhang Fei Zhao Yun and Huang Gai portray such loyalty that it would be kind of hard to imagine in todays society
From the other reviews Ive read most people think Liu Bei Xuande is the protaganist of the novel and this seems very true since Roberts lauds Beis characteristics and portrays Cao Cao of the evil and cunning type
Personally I think anyone can choose their personal protaganist and for me that would be Zhao Yun because of his undisputed bravery and loyalty
Another character that I admired was probably Zhuge Liang for his aweaspiring military tactics
Zhuge was the best strategist of his time and he wrote several books on warfare but unfortunately most were destroyed but you can still buy one of his famous books The Art of War
Warning spoiler ahead   This book has its sad moments particularly when someone important or someone who contributed a lot to his lord dies
Youll feel sympathetic towards those who fought hard as well as the ones who died
When the book starts its during the impending collapse of the Han then around  is when the real three kingdoms come into play Shu Wu and Wei
Its sort of like a battle to the death of who would emerge victorious and indeed there was
Military tactics are exploited on each side and betrayal is widespread
In the end it would be Sima Yis family who would unite China under one rule the Jin Dyansty.
I have heard that to truly understand Chinese culture one must read The Three Kingdoms
 That may be but this epic is a masterpiece of literature in any language
 I recommend this book to anyone interested in the classics of world literature.
Really wanted this as I only had Volumes I and II
 Much more accessible than earlier BrewittTaylor translation
 If you liked Red Cliffs short or  dvd international version  youd enjoy this.
The books arrived promptly and in excellent condition I was pleasantly surprised to find the character drawings ancient maps that described the provinces at the time and the people who ruled over them and a very in depth reference in the back of the book that went into detail about several of the incidents mentioned in the story and how they relate to historical records
Of course the story itself is an entertaining read
Highly recommended.
Very good translation of the original novel.
Awesome blend of history and story
 Difficult to tell where history leaves off and story begins.
If youre into classical Chinese literature this is a must read
Once I started could hardly put it down.
My son loved this book
He plays Koeis Dynasty Warriors series and he fell in love with this book
I read a little bit of it and I am rather fond of it too
I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good action book about unification of the land
This book has not left out a single detail about the story.
The writing doesnt flow very well but the story is very enjoyable.
Its like I never stop turning the page when I read this
 Truly amazing adventurous and full of perspective of many different characters.
Three stars because its three kingdoms
I couldnt get through the book
If the Odyssey just wasnt long enough this one is for you.
It is interesting to see what was going on in the ancient worlds other great empire at the same time that Rome was entering its century of chaos.
A timeless classic...
Been looking for these books since ever and I love them
Thank you
Having played a number of games in the Dynasty Warriors series I wanted to get acquainted with the original story
Id originally found a free copy hosted online but that copy was of an early th century translation and the antiquated language was often difficult to parse
The Moss Roberts translation has been considerably easier to read frequent spelling errors notwithstanding and I enjoy the illustrations and map diagrams that show up here and there
Ive nearly finished the second volume reading a chapter or two a day and look forward to several more weeks of adventure.
Ok Three Kingdoms is a amazing volume which mixes history with mythlogy during the three kingdom period of chinas past
It really is a great story The only bad part is that this volume seems like a rough draft
There are literally tons of spelling errors and misuse of english language
Obviously they should have put more effort into translating this better for the english audience
And the price of 
is a bit hefty for  paperback books I would look for a different translation for a cheaper buy.
The story is very extensive though having some grammar and spelling errors the four volumes story is an excellent read.
Outstanding.
Very entertaining
A timeless piece of literature
Capture the history of the Han Dynasty in a most intriguing tale where ideals and ambitions collide.
Good books
Three Kingdoms is one of the most important works of Chinese literature
The story itself is there but the ridiculous number of grammatical and spelling errors throughout the volume set can spoil the experience just a bit.
If you are alive and know how to read you should read this book no one in the world would give it less than  stars
 It is a very long book but it will be very much worth it to read anyway and when youre done you can brag to your friends that youve read a  page book
 It will go by much faster than you would think.
Set was Christmas gift for my nephew he really liked the book set and will buy the Chinese version later.
Very easy to understand
My best friend from America had wishes for this series so of course I was going to give it to her for Christmas
The package arrived earlier than I had expected
Nothing to complain about she LOVED the books Thank you very much 
Very good fast shipping.
Everything is perfect thank you
Amazing story could not put the books down.
Romance of the three kingdoms  what else can I say.
I originally bought it because I played the Dynasty Warriors games
 Now that I finished it I can easily say its one of my favorite stories.
Three Kingdoms is a action packed novel that deserves to be called a classic
 Nevertheless all the Chinese names and the repetitive battle scenes could easly lose the novice reader after the first thousand pages or so
 If you buy this be prepared to read the footnotes throughly and become a student of Chinese culture.
I much enjoyed this translation
Although the names are a little different it flowed quite well and its for a fourth of the cost
Got all my books and they were in good condition
Nuff said
epic
This history has a superb drama and excelent descriptions of the battles of old China
Recommended for those whom like a good plot heroic battles and everything else words can describe.
This novel is absolutely fabulous I recommend the tv serie which is really close to this novel Romance of the three kingdoms  ...
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is possibly the most famous and important novel in classic Chinese literature
 Not only is it the earliest of the Four Great Books as evidenced by its more archaic language but it created a complete cultural phenomenon whose impact is still fresh today  just ask all the young people today who without having read a word of the book still know the characters from the strategy and fighting video games released by the company Koei
 And how many literary works can claim to have had a direct impact on history as this book which was used as a strategy text by the great Manchurian leader Nurhachi and his son Hongtaiji Id read the original archaic text when I was about eight years old so obviously my views will be heavily slanted by my familiarity with this text
 On approaching this translation what I find is a well done respectful and informative translation that doesnt quite nail the tone of the original text but will be a good read for modern readers who dont read Chinese
And to be honest Chinese is extremely hard to translate into English
 Just the fact that subjects articles and pronouns are often omitted from a sentence is enough to cause nightmares for a ChineseEnglish translator
 And even by Chinese standards The Three Kingdoms is a work whose linguistic economy is staggering
 In one page this book can convey the deaths of half a dozen characters three to four battles multiple schemes and include four or five tribute poems to boot
 Such is the style of this work and it could not have been easy for translator Moss Roberts to adapt this style into English
 And he has done the job remarkably for though I dont think he was able to convey the flavour and rhythm of the original language the question is also whether that would have been possible his translation makes a good read and strives to be faithful to the original text down to the chapter divisions and the inclusion of the tribute poems which frequent the book
 This was an essential piece in the style of the book and I was joyed to see the device retained
There are instances scattered throughout where I felt the tone of the language may have been misinterpreted or diluted by the language barrier
 Obviously Im not a Chinese professor as Prof
Roberts is but as a native speaker I felt his translations sometimes didnt quite hit the mark
 For example in the original text one poem on the character Cao Cao distinctly used a word which meant deception or guile but Prof
Roberts adapted it to craft which dilutes the disapproving tone of the original
 When Yuan Shao refused aid to Liu Bei on account of his sons illness his advice to the messenger was if he is in trouble he may seek refuge with me which suggests patronage not find refuge north of the river which suggests a tactical manoeuvre related to geography
 These are but two examples and you can certainly argue that the meaning of the original text is up for grabs but as a Chinese native speaker and reader one who has grown up with this text and reread the book hundreds of times I still find the translation a little off
 There is also no attempt at creating period flavour in the language  the translation is modern not aiming to add archaic English flavour to try to reflect the age of the original Chinese text
 This may be a good point however since the use of archaic English added to the language barrier might have resulted in a book thats very difficult to read
 I think Prof
Roberts sacrificed flavour for clarity a fair tradeoff to the benefit of the translation
Again the question is whether an English translation or any other translation could ever be accurate in this way to the original
 Personally I do think many of the discrepancies in meaning could have been avoided or ameliorated
 However as aforementioned for a reader whos never read the original this issue wont affect hisher enjoyment of the text
 Just the fact that there is a translation of this extremely important work of Chinese literature is a cause for celebration and for those people new to this realm this set of books is a great discovery.
The package arrived very quickly and in perfect condition
 It was a gift for my son
 Hes enthralled by the story
 Moss is an excellent translator.
Very good quality compare to the price and mine got shipped after  weeks of order.
Great quality dont understand a lot of the complaints
Pages are fine notes are there writing and research are great
Only complaint is that comers of the books came are bent and damaged.
Way too many names for a single character and there is a ton of characters in the story.
Purchased as a gift for my son
He is very pleased
Xmas present was loved
the actual books were fantastic Moss Roberts translation is simply wonderful however the packaging was damaged so completely that the books were warped almost to the point of disfigurement..
quite a shame considering how wonderful the actual text is.
My husband loved it
I had various language collection of these books
Excellent story and well translated My wish is that the foot note can be put at the end of each page instead at the end of the book.
typos all around
ok why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good
 strange.
images no zoom
Exactly what expected and really happy for the purchase
The font size of words in this book is too small that will hurt your eyes
I am wondering why the press publish a book like this to save papers
that is so stupid
Great books in perfect conditions
I recommend everyone to read this series.
Great book
Received item as advertised although shipping took longer than normal.
Best version Ive found thus far
  volumes of musuo madness.
Son was thrilled with this gift exactly what he wanted
This is the most difficult to read book I have ever read
I mean this literally
I am not talking about the reading level or the quality of the translation
The pages are the thinnest I have ever seen in a book
You can clearly see the text from the other pages quite clearly
The low contrast makes the page literally difficult to read
I know they did this to cut costs but this is stupid if you cant even read the book
I would have rather paid an extra  to  dollars for some thicker pages and an extra volume
Try and find a better version if you can.
This is what I was promised Condition New BRAND NEWGOOD QUALITY AND FAST DELIVERY
ALL HAVE FREE TRACKING NUMBER WITH REGISTERED
What I really get is a broken case and two of the volumes are not in a good condition
Still the inside is good and the product is what I asked for
So the books are apparently not new or the delivery is of a very bad quality
Also I had some problems with the delivery at first but the communication with the seller is really good and he solved the problems quick and efficiently
I would recommend this seller and the product but I would care to ask for a good condition of the product before i ask for it...
the item is listed as a Box Set in good condition but i did not get the box to hold them in and the condition was  so it was less then what i expected but i know the books themselves are a good read
This is a great CD full of Rampals great masterpiece
Although the flute legend has passed away for over ten years his legacy lives on
His interpretation of these pieces are splendid and one can truly appreciate his work
I would recommend this to anyone who loves the flute especially those who want a different interpretation in music from someone other than James Galway.
The delivery was pretty speedy
Little damage to the side of the book I would have preferred it to be shipped in a box instead of a bag but got here fine with minimum damage.
The longlived Han dynasty is finally succumbing to effects of a weak Emperor and corrupt government that is cause injustice throughout China resulting peasant revolts while nobles strive to reform the court
 Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong probably dramatizes the year history of the end of the Han dynasty as the empire divided into the titular three kingdoms before being reunified under the Jin while being true to history for nearly the entire text
The weakness of the Emperor Ling and his corrupt court results in the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Emperor asks all loyal subjects to come to arms to fight the rebels
 Among that answering the call is Liu Bei a scion of the Imperial clan who befriends and joins in a sworn brotherhood Lord Guan and Zhang Fei Cao Cao a member of a long servicing Han bureaucratic family and Sun Jian an accomplished general
 The numerous warlords crush the rebellion but remain in charge of various districts when the Emperor dies thus setting the stage for the warlords vying for power by controlling the child Emperor and then his young brother when Lings immediate successor is deposed then murdered
 Sun Jian heads to the Southlands and founds a dynasty that is cemented by his son Ce that eventually becomes the Kingdom of Wu
 Cao Caos Machiavellian political acumen and military success results in him getting control of the last Han Emperor Xian and control of the northern heartland that eventually becomes the Kingdom of CaoWei
 Liu Bei and his sworn brothers bouncing from district and district trying to restore the independence and good governance of the Han but the warlords that they serve under continue to fight for their own power
 Then the brotherhood is joined by a militarypolitical advisor Kongming that uses Beis connection to the Imperial house to establish power in the Riverlands in the west of the empire to establish the kingdom of ShuHan
 Yet if not for the alliance between the Riverlands and Southland against Cao Cao in the battle of Red Cliffs the threefold division of the empire would not have happened
 After the death of Liu Bei and his sworn brothers Kongming becomes takes up their cause by his six campaigns against CaoWei are not successful in conquering the whole of the Northern Heartland
 Upon Kongmings death the Sima family rises within the ranks of the CaoWei that they eventually usurp and reunify the Empire as the Jin dynasty
Though Luo Guanzhong wrote his masterpiece roughly  years after the events of the novel he used extensive historical records plus numerous legends and popular stories from the period to enhance Three Kingdoms
 The resulting novel is considered seven parts history and three parts fiction the later portions surround the adventures and actions of Lord Guan and Kongming respectfully whose impact on history was either enlarger or their effectiveness increased
 On top of that Luo Guanzhong along with Mao Gonggang who edited the text a century later had a political agenda to favor Liu Bei over Cao Cao that giving the former great virtue while the latter is considered a usurper
 The fourvolume page novel is an engaging piece of historical fiction with a lot of annotation by Mao Guanzhong and translator Moss Roberts though it isnt perfect
 From the text itself there are hundreds of named characters though most of them are minor characters that are hard to keep straight through the major and secondary characters are easy to keep straight
 The Chinese name convention of surname given name is followed throughout and after a while its easy to get use to however one of Luo Guanzhongs decisions was to have some individuals have multiple names most notably Liu Bei Xuande and Kongming Zhuge Liang that at times confuses the reader
 The majority problem with the novel is unfortunately the Foreign Language Press edition that I read had grammatical and spelling errors on almost every page that too be fair was easy to read through but was a tad annoying
Three Kingdoms is a Chinese historical classic novel that I found to be a very readable novel thanks to the true to original translation approach of Moss Roberts that gave Luo Guanzhongs masterpiece its full meaning
 Though most of my issues are due to the publishers grammatical and spelling errors they didnt takeaway from the great historical story that was presented and gives the reader an insight into Chinese history and cultural thought.
misleading web page lead to a  penalty charge.
The cover of the book showing a bunch of giggling morons is enough to warn any serious reader that it is nothing but a collection of childish cartoons.
not was i was hoping for
 so many names after name
 like a chronology and not like a great flowing story.
Amazon seems to have combined more than one translation here but DO buy the Moss Roberts translation sold by Foreign Languages Press
I have just finished reading volume  of this translation comparing it word for word with a Japanese translation of the original medieval Chinese
The original language is hard to read but Roberts nails it
I believe it will be hard to surpass the accuracy of this translation
The Beijing edition the cheap one available here contains all of the useful footnotes available in the UC Press edition and relatively few typos
This classic epic novel is wellknown to almost all educated people in East Asia and if you have the time to focus on the text and remember the names of the characters it is more engaging and thoughtinspiring than a hundred books of political philosophy
Run dont walk
Like many other reviewers the way I first found out about this book was through the Dynasty Warriors video game
I decided to try reading the unabridged version though somewhat daunted by the size
I did expect the book to be interesting but I also thought it would be difficult reading
Little did I expect for the book to far exceed my expectations The Three Kingdoms is a fascinating look into the history albeit somewhat fictionalized of China during a roughly  year period between  AD during which the Han Dynasty fellthe Han was the longest lasting and most powerful dynasty according to the Afterword
The book is full of stories of honor courage and loyalty as well as betrayal cowardice and deception
Three Kingdoms is not just a book about wars although battle is featured prominently in the bookit spends equal or greater amounts of time peering into the political intrigue powerstruggles and military strategy
The book is loaded with characters which presents probably the greatest challenge to a Western reader
Learning the names of the main characters might come easier than you might think and there is a helpful list of main characters in the back of the fourth volume though even many of those listed there appear only momentarily in the novel
I would also suggest reading the foreward and at least the beginning of the afterword in the fourth volume before beginning the bookit will give helpful background information
The storytelling in the Three Kingdoms is so compelling that I often found myself practically cheering for my favorite characters and often laughing out loud at peculiar victories or witty dialogue
The beginning of the book focuses on Liu Bei Xuande a man of admirable character and virtue but often frustrating leadership
The main body of the book deals with Zhuge Liang Kongming who is Liu Beis military strategist
Kongming is definitely the most fascinating character and his strategies and manipulation are delightful to watch unfold
The book also has scores of heroes and villains and gives insight into the values and virtues that were highly regarded by the Chinese
Towards the end of the book the storyline briefly begins to sag as most of the main characters die off and yet the characters Jiang Wei and Deng Ai redeem the end of the book and still carry on the suspense and excitement that was stronger and brighter in the first ths of the novel
All in all I was disappointed when I finished ONLY because there wasnt more to read I would definitely read this book again and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a true epic of Chinese history.
This is an amazing historic literary work
It is similar to Homers Iliad and Odyssey Based on history but has many fictitious moments
This is my personal favorite set of books
I chose my major because of this work
Moss Roberts does a fantastic translation of a literary work that has helped shape China
The book opens with Liu Xuande Liu Bei Guan Yu and Zhang Fei declaring their brotherhood
This work flows with strategy both militaristic and political with many vying for power with an unlikely force winning
In the end the shadows are the way to gain overall power
This set comes with  books with the first having a green cover and no real extras and the second has a blue cover with the conclusion and many extras including definitions of titles places etc
Notes are also contained within the second volume which greatly help in understanding the flow and historical background of the work and a chronology of events is also placed in the second volume with many other extras also included
Overall an amazing translation of an amazing historic literary work.
This translation of Three Kingdoms one of Chinas four great classical novels is extremely accurate and reads excellently and fluently
 Roberts finds a middle ground between fidelity and spirit
 The language used is not archaic yet the translation is faithful
 It remains one of the best translated texts of Chinese literature ever
 Roberts must be congratulated for translating a book that reads as well as it did in the original written six centuries ago
Trouble is the version Roberts translated wasnt textually what Luo Guangzhong really wrote
 It was a text embellished by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang at the start of the Qing Dynasty circa   years after the most ancient extant text was established that of the Jiajing Renwu edition 
 The  edition preface dated  is known as the Sanguo Tongsu Yanyi abbreviated TS by Roberts
All credit to Roberts he discusses with great scholarly attentiveness the differences between the s Mao edition and  Jiajing Renwu Tongsu edition in an informative afterword
 Roberts said that the differences and literary merits were disputed amongst scholars
 But for people wanting to read a version truer to Luo Guanzhongs vision the Maos version is certainly an embellishment if not an outright revision
 The differences are not minor
The question we should ask today is should we be reading the Maos revision of the original novel in c
 or Luos own written around   There are people who advocated the Mao version as the superior more literary edition
 This is no different from scholars who used to edit Shakespeare to make him more palatable to the tastes of their times
What the Maos did was to add their own judgments to the text
 Luos TS version of  paints a more accurate historical version of the characters from the historical annals Sanguo Zhi
 Some people may argue the characters might be drier but the Maos changes reflect their own tastes and political allegiances
 The Maos were clearly proLiu and antiCao
 Cao Cao became Public Enemy No  Liu Bei the embodiment of righteous dynastic rule Guang Yu and Zhuge Liang were deified
 They divided the book into  chapters the TS version was in  scrolls and  parts each ie
 parts
The Maos changed  of the text
 The effect is cumulative in such a long work as Three Kingdoms
 The characterizations are changed quite drastically
To Roberts credit he does provide footnotes where the  revised edition differs from the  version
 He is right too that the Maos edition remains the most printed and read version in China such was its influence
 But to go back to the root of Luo Guanzhongs vision one must translate the  edition
Frankly the s version isnt that bad
 Its an embellished version more literary and may suit certain peoples tastes better
 For one thing the line The empire long divided must unite long united must divide isnt in the older version
 But since the  edition almost definitely represent Luos work more faithfully readers should have their selection
 Since Professor Shen Bojuns magisterial edition of the Jiajing Renwu version appeared nearly two decades ago which corrects technical errors ie
errors in dates etc the task shouldnt be that arduous
  of the text is already in the s version
 Voice of hope however idealistic give us the Jiajing Renwu version and the Sanguo Zhi the full historical annals please Mr Roberts
Imagine my surprise when my eleven year old son placed a few names from a video game Dynasty Warriors into Google and came up with biographies of real Chinese warlords
Investigating I found that the game was based on Chinese Literature a historical book written in the s about rd Century China by Luo Guanzhong
My son promised he would read the book if I ordered it
The book as ordered is printed in China and is broken into four  page sections
I did buy it and with his background from the game he sailed through all  sections in record time with nothing but high praise
I have read it myself and highly recommend it to anyone
We have also purchased the TV serialized DVD collection in Chinese with English Subtitles which is absolutely facinating viewing for those who have read the original books
The DVDs require staying power there are  of them put out by Chinese government TV studios
The recording quality and the subtitle errors are a bit of a deterent to all but real Three Kingdom Fans
If you are expecting a slick Hollywood film dont buy the DVDs.
And its about time too
Moss Roberts does an excellent job of translating the epic novel by Luo Guanzhong in a full unabridged four book series
Previously I had read an abridged version by the selfsame translator and while I was impressed with the story it was too choppy to satisfy me
I later found this unabridged version purchased it at once and loved every moment of reading
This is it
The definitive Three Kingdoms
The Three Kingdoms is based on the era known as The Three Kingdoms period or San Guo Yan Yi
This period chronicles the decline of the Han to the rise of the Jin dynasty circa AD 
The story tells the tale of protagonist Zhuge Liang referred to as Kongming throughout the story and his efforts to help his lord Liu Bei referred to as Xuande throughout the story unite the land and restore the crumbling Han
You see Liu Bei is a distant cousin of the child emperor Liu Xian who is manipulated by the malicious despot Cao Cao
Bei a poor mat weaver steps up to the plate and helps to put down the Yellow Scarf rebellion under Zhang Jue and the story takes off from there
Zhuge Liang does not actually come into the story until much later and dies in the middle of the fourth volume but his importance is immeasurable
This story is a mustread for history fans as well as fans of any of the video game series about the time period Dynasty Warriors Romance of the Three Kingdoms Dynasty Tactics etc.
Fans of the video game series will love to hear tales of their favorite characters such as Guan Yu Zhang Fei Zhao Yun and many more
An important thing to keep in mind when reading Luo Guanzhongs novel is that it is a biased account of the events
Luo Guanzhong is what I call a proShuist or someone who supports Shu the kingdom ruled by Liu Bei so Shu feats may be embellished and fans of the other kingdoms Wei Wu might be frustrated as many of their favorite characters will not be viewed as positively as they may deserve to be
With this in mind The Three Kingdoms is a fun if not lengthy read and will keep you turning the pages
The story isnt terribly difficult to follow but some may have trouble keeping track of the cast of characters some  plus characters in all and all of their names
What I mean by all of their names is that the chinese had the surname Zhuge the given name Liang and a style Kongming
Some officers are called by all three names and it can be difficult to follow
Zhuge Liang is called many things over the course of the novel in addition to his surname given name and style but it shouldnt be to hard to follow
Probably easier then following my explanation of it at any rate
My major complaint with this edition and it is minor is the poor proofreading and the poor quality of the paper and binding
This book was published to Beijing standards and would not meet American standards
You will have to be a little careful with the book while reading it but thats not too big of a problem
Also the typos two or three a chapter can get annoying and make you wonder who was proofreading the book and make you think that you could do a better job and you probably could
That aside this is a very enjoyable story and you will not be disappointed in buying the fourvolume unabridged set translated by Moss Roberts.
One of the greatest of epic novels
I received this book as a gift and Ill treasure it forever
I know Ill return to it several times in the future to reread it
The book is as long as five novels but its more fun than almost any five novels you could choose
The epic sweep through  years of Chinese history is amazing
The narrative is swift and compelling
The battles are spectacular and exciting
The charactersespecially Kongming Cao Cao and Lord Guanare wonderfully memorable and alive
The English translation aside from a few typos and misspellings is good
I dont speak Mandarin so I wish someone would make a movie version of the story in English or provide a subtitled version of one of the many Chinese screen adaptations
If I have one problem with the book its the character of Xuande
Hes weak and indecisive and lacks the qualities needed in an epic hero
Its hard to see what the other characters saw in him.
Like many people I first heard of this novel through the games from Koei
I played romance of the three kingdoms on my Nintendo when I was in high school
A few years ago I started playing the dynasty warriors series of games on the playstation
I had always wanted to read the novel and Im glad I did
The story starts around  AD just at the end of the Han dynasty
It continues until the end of the Han dynasty in  and finally to the reunification of china around 
The principle characters are rulers generals and politicians that make up the Wu Wei and Shu kingdoms
The book is really fast read considering that the book is  pages long it really didnt take that long to read
It is interesting and something is always going on
I dont think I would have enjoyed being a third century Chinese general
They have a pretty short life
It was kind of sad when character that I really like got killed but considering the time span of the novel it was bound to happen
The novel does focus on the time period from  after that things start going pretty quick and after  AD the story is essentially over except for a few details
I cant recommend it enough you could read it  times and still get something out of it
If I were stuck on a desert island this would be one of the books Id like to have
Now all I need to do is visit china and see some of this stuff from the book
This review is actually for the unabridged Moss Roberts translation This book lives up to its reputation as a sourcebook for Chinese adventure politics history culture and just plain swashbuckling fun
For the translator it is a work of a lifetime  this comes from an amateur sinologist who remains daunted by the original texts of works such as Three Kingdoms
Roberts joins David Hawkes in the alltime Chinese translation hall of fame
For those interested in an introduction to the drama and adventure that provide the framework for Chinese thinking about large issues such as nationbuilding and nationdestroying love honor war and peace this is the ultimate guidebook
Long before Gibbon wrote the Decline and Fall ..
and Asimov wrote the Foundation series the Chinese were obsessed with the process of dynastic change and transformation in their own country
It is impossible to overstate the role of this work in Chinese culture  it is as if everyone in the West actually grew up reading  and loving  the Iliad and the Odyssey
In the sweep of history though the personal is not lost
Personalities large and small march across the scene and the reader is swept up in their strivings to find a place and something to strive for as the structure of the world turns upside down
For the great Han Dynasty is falling and no one knows what new configuration will take its place
Military and political geniuses opportunists men and woman who play a significant role of cruelty and vision emerge to strive in a chaotic arena seeking to make their mark on the new order to come
In this sense Three Kingdoms is a human story which repeats itself again and again but this is one of the bejewelled versions
Roberts translation is accompanied by extensive endnotes which are fascinating to the Sinologist but which cannot help but distract from the action
Reserve them for later perusal
Finally the translator has done a tremendous job of translating the poetry in the book  often used to eulogize heroes and martyrs who give their lives out of loyalty to their leaders or who go down fighting in a losing cause
These bits of verse help to cast the necessary sense of the futility of human strivings which pervades this work and the Chinese sensibility generally
The heroes see their own deeds as tiny drops in a great river of history and their names to be forgotten in years to come
If Cao Cao Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang only knew how Luo and Roberts have extended their memory in times and worlds they could never have imagined.
First off you have to read the full translation of this book
 I read the  abridged version of Three Kingdoms translated by Moss Roberts first and thought it was pretty good but felt that the story wasnt developed  enough and lacked cohesion
 Then a few years ago I finally found and  purchased the full unabridged version published by the University of  California Press and also translated by Dr
Roberts
 This is the  fullblown epic from start to finish with all the details and many of the  translation errors of the previous editions eliminated
 The prose was also  improved and flows eloquently throughout the books entire  pages
 Three Kingdoms is the tale part historical part legend and myth of the  fall of the Later Han Dynasty of China
 It chronicles the lives of those  feudal lords and their retainers who tried to either replace the empire or  restore it
 While the novel actually follows literally hundreds of  characters the focus is mainly on the  families who would eventually  carve out the  kingdoms from the remnants of the Han
 The Liu family in  the Shu kingdom led by Liu Bei The Cao family in Wei led by Cao Cao and  the Sun family in Wu eventually led by Sun Quan
 The book deals with the  plots personal and army battles intrigues and struggles of these  families to achieve dominance for almost  yrs
 This book also gives you  a sense of the way the Chinese view their history  cyclical rather than  linear as in the West
 The first and last lines of the book sum this  view up best The empire long united must divide..
and  The empire long divided must unite..
If you are at least a  little interested in Chinese history ancient or modern and culture this  book is a must read.
When I first read Three Kingdoms it was quite a confusing story what with all the endless characters that came and went not to mention the impossibility of pronouncing their names properly Nonetheless I was captivated by the quality of the story despite the very basic narrative style being hundreds of years old and the fairly simple way it must have been translated
With the amount of trials and tribulations that the reader witnesses in following the extremely incredible characters it is no wonder that these real people from history mean so much to people today nearly two thousand years later
Containing personalities of all kinds Three Kingdoms offers so much wisdom and excitement that once you get past the first couple of chapters you are really drawn into a whole new world
To follow the struggles of men like Guan Yu Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang as they fight for peace amongst the absolute chaos gives hope and solutions to any of the problems one can face in todays world
Yet there are hundreds of characters who fight by their sides in attempts to reunite China each having their own story to contribute to this immortal saga
It is truly a credit to Luo Guanzhong the way he managed to interweave so many storys and yet stay prevalently factual
If you can get past the confusion and the slight redundancy of the narrative style Three Kingdoms is a story you have to read within your lifetime and preferably as soon as possible
According to DWK.COM there is a new version of Three Kingdoms that is to be released soon designed to be more entertaining and less confusing than the  year old original
Apparently it will still contain all of the wisdom from Luo Guanzhongs but will make a much more accessable and hopefully even more enjoyable way to learn about Three Kingdoms
In the meantime I can also suggest the other  chinese classics in english known as Dream of the Red ChamberDreams of Red MansionsRomance Monkey KingJourney to the West AdventureFantasy and Water MarginOutlaws of the Marsh Adventure
Each are incredible stories in their own right and are in many ways equal or even better than Three KingdomsRomance of Three Kingdoms.
Much better than Game of Thrones
 I read this book about ten times now
 I cant get over how good it is
 Ive read over ten thousand books in my life time and I have to say this is probably my favorite out of all of them.
I bought the book with some background of the subjects so I had a good idea of what it would be like
It is written differently than most American writers style which may be weird to somebody that does not realize how authentic the subject and writing actually is
The book is very detailed and for anyone that loves Chinese history of the  AD period this book will give you a good description of it
The characterization and background of the main parties is very indepth and you get a great idea of the temperaments for all the main characters
What keeps me from giving this a  star rating is that some words are missed due to translation errors as well as some poor attempts at dramatizing certain moments
Other than those few awkward moments I am really enjoying the books
I love the story characters and overall cultural depictions.
Last year a friend of mine recommended this masterpiece of Roberts to me to sharpen my English and I found its a masterwork as excellent as that of the original author about  years ago
Its said that the literature works belong to their own ethnic groups their languages and cant be translated without losing or adding the meaning
But this epic translated by Roberts completely grasps the meaning of Chinese both literal meaning culture meaning and history background meaning of words not only the surface meaning but also the deep meaningthe meaning in English is just the same as that in Chinese no more and no less
If a Chinese author translated this middleages novel to modern Chinese as Prof
Roberts to modern English he can do no more and better than Prof
Roberts
 years ago as a boy I read this Chinese epic of Luoguan Zhong but ignored the last  chapters whose content is about how traitor overwhelmed loyalists and not political correct
But this English version read I from the st word to the last word including the annotation which contains many Chinese history events and lores even common Chinese dont know
The shortcoming of this translation is to nonChinese readers especially the English name of the peopleplace in this history fiction
I think western readers will be easily confused because when  years ago I firstly read this book I was also confused except tens of the main roles
But the translation of title is so cool
kautsuthe earliest ancestor of this dynasty and taitsuwuhugdithe st emperor and the founder of this dynasty with many martial merits is translated to Augustusthe only and very  correct translation I think
In Chinese books about Julius Caesar Augustus in Rome history Augustus is simply transliterated to augusidu because hardly a corresponding ancient Chinese title can be found   is the fittest one.
This is the unabridged version and truly a masterpiece
 I was familiar with a very small portion of the history during this time period before I read it so that encouraged me to try it out
 If you love epic stories this is a great one
 Guanzhong based his novel on solid historical facts while adding some fictional elements in order to bring out the characters and events for the reader
 Ive heard it said and I agree with it that it is  history and  fiction
 Addtionally this is a must read for any fans of the Dynasty Warriors gaming series
 My recommendation is that if you have any interest in this period of Chinese history or stories of heroics and loyaltytothedeath buy it and I guarantee that you wont regret it.
the other reviews probably say enough about the Three Kingdoms for me not to repeat them
 I came to this novel after playing the old Koei games and I loved reading it
My only problem with the box set is that the books format seemed very poor to me
 After paying  bucks with shipping it was a little disappointing to realize I only got three yes three though the entire novel was there
 I have no idea why it says Volume Boxed Set little paperbacks with a very very small typeset on filmy paper that is very easy to smudge and smear
 Also there are more typos than there are hairs in Cao Caos beard
 Distracting
I dont think you should let this deter you from reading the three kingdoms
 But perhaps if you know youre going to love it you might want to wait until a much higher class version comes out than the one from the university press I got.
This book is a truly epic tale of ancient civilization
It is a historical fiction of roughly  AD the period of the fall of the Han dynasty with Liu Bei and Peach Garden brothers set as the heros
The plot of this  page tale centers around the political and military exploits of various leaders of the age
The dissolving the dynastic rule the rise of warlords and the subsequent consolidation into three major kingdoms
The story telling is superb in echoing themes from earlier chapters and for thematically bonding disparate events and characters
The story also mixes in many different observations into the nature of morality politics leadership and loyalty
This translation seems to be based on the Mao edition the footnotes are helpful for understanding the historical allusions and identifying where the fiction differs from history
This printing has a fair number of typos that are sad but not very detracting from the story.
Four GREAT Chinese classics roam over Chinese Literature and among those Romance of the three kingdoms Dream of the Red Chamber the Monkey King and ShueyHudran Romance of the three kingdoms is deemed as second place right after the Dream of the Red Chamber
It is a work in the plot of the Three Kingdoms history book which is written in ancient Chinese and is thus very hard to comprehend
The Romance of the Three Kingdoms however is a very intriguing accomplishment
However if one read the translation version one must bear in mind that there are lots names very similar
I myself have read the Chinese version which made it much easier to comprehend
The storyline is an adventure and a great warning to imperialism
The three kingdoms stand in enmity and eventually none of them won
This is the ThreeKingdom tragedy and the end of the ThreeKingdom dynasty
Lots of symbolism and fables to be interpreted
Very thoughtful and comprehensive all plot tied up extremely conherently
The characters as far as I know are all real
China could not have thrived without the greatness of the Three Kingdoms for it developed numerous Chinese proverbs numerous location names and numerous Gods to be worshiped
It is one of the greatest classics in the world and it must be savored  every bit of it.
You should
Three Kingdoms is the number  bestseller in the history of mankind after King James Bible
Couple billion readers cannot be wrong so have your faith in this book
Three Kingdoms...
I read it about  times now
Everytime I read it I learn something new or see a different point of view according to my own maturity
You can talk about Tolkien Jordan Martin and other masters of fantasy novels but unless you read this one you dont know what the hell you are talking about
Part fiction part history get ready to immerse yourself in epic that is equal to none
You have just found the book of your dreams.
I first became familiar with the Three Kingdoms period through the video game Romance VII on PS
Through the game I was able to understand what each charecter is capable of doing which illustrated a clear narrative of the basic concepts involved
After playing Romance VIII  Romance X I more or less understood what the novel had to offer
After playing these games I decided to go to the main source  the novel
While reading the novel I started associating the images and scenarios from the games with the text
Although you will know how most events will unfold the endless names ranks locations and procedures will make sense which without you will be bored to death
So to sum things up I highly recommend you play some of the romance games in particular Romance X so to know how significant some events like the meeting of the brothers or the battle with the strongest man under heaven are.
The story itself is amazing the translation lively and I like that it had little pictures once in a while to give me a picture in my head of what these characters looked like
HOWEVER...There are quite a few spelling mistakes outofplace words and mixed up letters bd and pq
 I bought a set directly from China so Im not sure if the edition for sale in North America has these flaws
 They dont cause any major comprehension problems but theyre frequent enough for me to knock off  star
Still this is the translation you should get even if their proofreader should have been fired.
I got this a while ago and it was a great read if you have ever played any of the dynasty warriors games you might want to check this set out it is a good deal dont miss out on it.
I first was introduced to this story by first playing the the game Dynasty Warrriors  for Playstaion ...
Even though I am not finished with the three volumes so far it has been excellent and very detailed for an a historical story that happened about two millenia ago
 I am now on the second volume and wont stop till I get to the end
One thing about these books is that it is very difficult readed and not that easy to follow at times because the names of the people can get confusing the chinese has their names last name first and given names following and also the people in this story sometimes are called by a second name which is common in the chinese culture
 One would have to read these books at least two more times after the first to get the story down because according to my mother my grand father had read the same story in China and told my mom that he had to read it a few times to fully understand this complex time in the history of prefeudal China and a story still being studied militarily and historically to this day
 In a nutshell dispite the difficult read and complex story which I found to a challenge it is excellent and did not before starting expect it ot be easy is excellent for someone who wants to be challenged whether or not they have played the game or who just is intrigued by an important time in the history of China
 It is good for people just learning about this country or for some who like me have played the game and is caught by the intriguing story that the game was based on.
What of the typos and errors whine some reviewers
Or the tediousness of the story as a whole cry others
One even proposes the introduction of a television show based upon the events of the Three Kingdoms so as to alleviate the dullness within this epic
So before I begin my review I must submit a brief warning   If you possess the attention span of a five year old have the vocabulary skills of a newborn all errors can be corrected mentally within seconds of their discoveryor prefer movies to books than this is not for you
Hopefully anyone that suffers from all three ailments has not defiled this book by even considering its purchase
Enough ranting
To the book itself
  This is a passport to the ancient China of lore where great heroes mingled with Taoist sorcerers where the pageantry and lavishness of the Emperors court was matched only by the suffering of the peasants at the other extreme
This is the China of the treacherous yet mighty Lu Bu the wise Zhuge Liang and the ambitious Cao Cao
And lastly this is the China of the Three Kingdoms Wu Wei and Shu
  From the rout of the Yellow Scarves in the opening scenes of the novel to the fall of Wu and the unification of the Empire over a hundred years later this story flows seamlessly intricately weaving the clash and bloodshed of battle with the scheming and intrigue that fills the tales early pages
This is a blend of fiction and fact after all so Luo Guanzhong does not have the ability to twist the plot in any one direction though Liu Bei emerges as a hero to Cao Caos brutal villainand so some of the lesser fights are told matteroffactly
  However there is something about The Three Kingdoms  the Taoist magic the great warriors the colorful picture that the author paints of palace life  that keeps it fresh and wipes away the dryness that fills other legends
While Jiang Weis endless string of defeats at the end of the novel appears to grow old it is only because the reader has grown so attached to the Kingdom of Shu that its losses are your losses and so when Liu Shan capitulates so suddenly you are disgusted
But it had to occur did it not As promised in the novels opening line The empire long united must divide
The empire long divided must unite
So it has been...
Ill admit I purchased this novel because of the addictive Playstation  games put out by Koei that are based on the Three Kingdoms story and characters
 Even being relatively familiar with the characters and plot I found the novel to be very difficult to digest if only because hundreds of characters are introduced and often killed or left behind every few pages
 The storyline is vivid and interesting and this is an excellent novel
 This version is very helpful due to extensive endnotes and a preface and afterword that fleshes out the background and meaning of the novel
 I would recommend it to anyone whos interested in political and military adventures but you should be prepared to invest substantial amounts of time in reading it.
It is an excellent novel and the translation is great
When I read the story I felt like I traveled back to the history and witnessed the events unfolding in front of my eyes
The story depicts the loyalty integrity sacrifice friendship betrayal treachery and human fragiltiy
Today I can not imagine someone  can match the characters of Lord Guan and zhao Zilong for their loyalty integrity courage and sacrifice
I was also amazed  perhaps intrigue about the Emperor Xian who somehow could not seek the service from Li Xuande and his people
Perhaps the Chinese history would have a new twist if Emperor Xian had used Li Xuande to protect the Han dynasty
 Sum it up the reasons or culprits that led to the collapse of the Han dynasty or any other dynasties later in Chinese history were due a weak ruler abuses of power from eunichs or misuse of talents in the court
The irony is nobody could imagine that in the end the entire realm was united by Sima Yan to found the Jin  dynasty but not by Cao cao or Li Xuande or Sun Quan as the three main characters in the story of the three kingdoms that fought against one another.
I have just finished reading this book and was moved to make a comment
First of all I want to say that this is a complete version of  Three Kingdoms not an unabridged one
The Foreign Language Press published this English translation made by Moss Roberts in four volumes and  pages which include many notes several drawings and some maps
The edition was very carefully done
About the content I just can say that it is a monumental painting of humanity made through the light of a very difficult time in China history
One hint at the end of volume four a list of principal characters is included which results very useful along the reading
As always thanks to Amazon that brought this book to my hands.
This book is based on the critical time at the end of the Han Dynasty
It all starts with the Yellow Scarves Rebellion lead by Zhang Jiao and his two brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang  plung the land into complete chaos
Answering the call of duty three sworn oath brothers  Liu Bei  Zhang Fei  and Guan Yu  go to fight the menece along with thousands of others
After that was done  Dong Zhuo  an Imperial General was controling the Emperor like a puppet
Him and his mighty step son Lu Bu  take control of the Imperial Court
To Stop these traitors  many great generals  Including Cao Cao  Sun Jian  Liu Bei  and many more with the chosen leader Yuan Shao destroy these verman
From these events comes a chain of cause and effect that basicly  leads to the collapseof the  once great  Han Dynasty 
 Best book Ive ever read EVER
On a scale of  to  Id give it a .
I dont want to leave a long comment because the truth is the book is a great classic
My only problem with it has been constant grammar errors
Once Lord Guan Yu is referred to as Lory Guan Yu and just things like that
In fact on the back of the book their is an error in the first line so I will say that I wish the editor would have done a better job with the errors but other than that its flawless
First off Id like to say I do enjoy this book and the history behind it
 I am a history major and plan on being a novelist someday writing ancient historicallike novels
 Thus this and several other books are prime for my reading list..
but as a general novel I found this book lacking
 This is probably because it is translated but I found this book to be choppy as well as lacking in descriptive writing
 Sword fights between two major figures last for one or two sentences max
 There arent any vivid descriptions of anything
 Im not someone who needs two pages describing a flower the worst case of long unnecessary description Ive come across but I would like to know what a character looks like more than just his height or what a building or city looks like
 Surely major battles involving thousands shouldnt start and finish in one or two pages
 I suppose that this story could have been twice as long had he allowed descriptions but I would have enjoyed it a bit more.
I think  kingdoms is a different type of novel from the Western traditional style .It doesnt focus much on the personal of characterstheir feeling thoughts..
because it has to deal with hundreds of them.The book itself is a page turner  there are many things which are repeated many times but you nerver feel boring
  In chinese we called  kingdoms as  facts  myths.The main character is considered Kongming Kongming  a brilliant military leader and politican but his talent was exaggerated in the book in formal history his main credit was to save the kingdom of Shu from the Weis menace
Sima Yi this man is a master schemera superb politican and military leader
 Sima did not want a total war with the Shu because as long as Kongming ramained a menace to  Wei kingdom  he is  still useful with the Caos family.And by distinguised himself by battles with Kongming  he gradulally gained control of the Wei and finally it was the Simas family who unitied China and declared themself emperor
Cao Cao the Chinese love this man his brilliant as well as his ruthless.He was never a king  but one of the most emperor in Chinas history changed his nickname to Cao Cao  and Mao ZeDong writes poems to praise him
Cao Cao was extremely suspicious  I would rather betrayed the world than have the world betrayed me
A good comapre to Cao is Stalin.
Ive read many classics such as Don Quixote War and Peace and Guillivers Travels
 None of these is as readily accessible to younger readers as this set of books is
 There is more action in one page of this book than any book Ive read before
 And similarly the dialogue is quick to the point and wastes few words
 Descriptions are minimal explanations brief and intrigue constant
 If youre someone like me that grew up on video games and television this is likely a book youll easily get into likely enjoy and almost definitely learn much from
Why the heck couldnt we have read books like this in school
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is my favorite Chinese literature
This is one of the best classics in Chinese history
This  volume set tells you one of the bloodiest war in ancient China
This is a MUST READ if you are into Chinese classics
From the uprising of Shu Wei and Wu and the to the unification of the whole three kingdoms.
The title of this review truly says it all for this martial epic
One would not make an overstatement by comparing this bbok to such powerful works of literature as the iliad or the nibelung.Everything from characters to plot is richly portrayed.Characters are epic and complex and he storyline is iaginative and rich
The only chinese novel that cann supposedly surpass this book is The Dream of the red chamber and I cant wait to read it
Having read both the original Chinese text and Mr
Roberts accurate translation I can say without hesitation  that Mr
Roberts achievement is nothing short of monumental
If you want to understand China and how  Chinese think this book is a must.
The Three Kingdoms have been since its creation the staple of literature in the Orient
It has been translated into Korean Japanese and numerous other languages and has been read by scholars historians and military strategists everywhere in Northern Asia
However as anyone who has already read the Three Kingdoms in any of the North Eastern Asian languages will promise the English version unfortunately does not capture the essence in which the Odyssey of China rose to its widespread fame and ubiquity
It lacks the characterstics that demand to stand as one of the greatest historical and legendary pieces in existence today
That is why it is literature not simply history
The artistic hand of Luo Guanzhong is almost wiped off and a bland history with awkward word choice is left that leaves little to imagination and wonder
For people who are interested in the epics of Chinese literature to gain a simple understanding of the events and perhaps some of the strategies the book can be recommended
However to truly appreciate the epic that has created sayings that if you read the story three times you can be deemed a scholar the translation simply lacks too much
It is unfortunately another case of great literature unable to be shared since it was lost in translation.
These books are telling a story about what happened in the late Han Dinasty
Full of dramatic event magnificent stategems implemented and actually fun to read as long as you have stamina to do it since it is a really thick for every volume.
probably the most popular novel in china  vietnam  japankorean.....
this is a wonderful book  maybe the greatest book i have ever known
Seeing  some reviews said that Liu Bei is the main hero of the novel in China we disliked and considered him a man who know nothing but cry and a demagogue 
the  most fascinating character must be Cao Cao  the translation missed some quotes of him  and even the famous seven battle of Kong Ming with the barbarian of which he captured the rebels leader realesed him and then recaptured....
Even with the best translator there are still some  poems words...
that seem impossible to translate into  english  if you know chinese try to buy this book in chinese.
I am a normal  year old boy who likes china
 And let me tell you somthing this book is the best book ever It has a huge stand point on war and art
This book is the Unabriged version and has a lot of names but you will get the main people in the story
For any of you who have played the viedo game forget everything you know because its alot different
I give this book  out of 
The version should be bought because Robert Moss has about  pages of helpful quotes pictures and maps.
It fits its hype of being one of the four Chinese classics
It takes you back in time and shows the culture drama and situation of China around  to  AD
You will find yourself reading the first chapter and not wanting to stop
The epic book does well by hooking the reader in
  However there are many characters in which to remember
Luckily the characters themselves can at many times be distinguish from each other
Very good book indeed
The story gets Five stars But the quality of the books gets a Three or Four
The pages are really thin and there are a lot words that are spelled incorrectly
Thankfully the words are fairly easy to figure out but having to solve the occasional word puzzle in the middle of the story can be quite annoying
This is still one of the greatest stories ever written and an excellent buy.
The Three Kingdoms is set right at the end of the Han dynasty and covers more than a century when the unity of China was broken
 Moss Roberts has done a good job translating this vigorous history of alliances betrayals bravery cowardace and greed
 It isnt exactly a historical novel as there are many supernatural elements but you do get a good feeling of what life was like in those turbulent times
He cleverly puts the analytical essay at the end since most of us wouldnt appreciate it if it had been at the beginning.
A
The story is just beautifuly written
I love Chinese history and mythology and all that stuff and this was just..
beautiful
I am really enjoying the work of these books and to all of you that like Chinese history andor mythology then please taky some time to read at least one volume of this series
The only thing is the names may start to get confusing so if you dont have a very good memory then it will get very confusing about whos who
Other than that this was perfect.
This Book is one of the best books ever you know..
Since i got the games by koei man I know alot about what happens in the game and I got a EnglishKoreanchineseJapanese translated.
thats how much i like the book..
It my ship like in  weeks...well on a scale of  i give it a ...Seehow good it is...I dont Like reading only games but this book i read about  times it sooo gooooddddd....
I have been seeking to this book for a while
Now that I have gotten far into it I can honestly say that this is a great book for anyone that has heard about it or just curious about it
Its just great
This is definitely good book for people who want to learn history of china and from this book you can also find some very helpful information and methods in your daily life
You should not only read this book but also you should keep a copy of it on you desk.
I love history
 Now when I read this Novel I was in heaven
 I mena I read about the defeat of Mengde Cao Cao at Red Cliffs I red about the Death of Kongming Zhuge Liang with great sadness
 I efinately recommend this novel to anyone
 Even if they dont like histoy they should still find theis to be a great read.
The book is set an ancient china from a.d
to a.d
or something like that
the reason i got into this is because of Koeis Dynasty Warriors series especially 
It has political features and also has a bunch of betrayals.
I am a big fan of The Three Kingdoms saga
 I wanted a version that in my mind was worthy of the wonder and significance of the work
 This version for the cost is very disappointing
 I am through the first nine chapters or so and I must say that this version does not live up to expectations
 I see typographical and spelling  errors on seemingly every other page
 There are also numerous references within the text to other works and versions that make me think there have to be more comprehensive superior versions out there
 I wanted a version that I could hang onto for decades something worthy of prominent display on my bookshelves and this one isnt it
 If you are new to the ROTK world this could be a great introductory work but only if it were  cheaper
 Avoid and instead try the local library.
The history being in the nonbiased form was even more empowering than the fictional editions of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms..
A textbook for honor and duty.
Entertaining.
My love for tea brought me to explore the Chinese antiquity more and more
Three Kingdoms in CHINA san guo yan yi its contents  are true and  fictive.Other history book san guo zhi by Chen Shou if you like Three Kingdomsyou should read this book.
One of the best stories Ive ever I dont read that much though.It makes you think that you have actualy witnessed it and to some can be found quite sad not me.Its a bit complicated and to think but thats what i like about a book.
The post office lost the original order and their customer service was completely unresponisive This left me very frustrated and just about ready to throw up my hands until I contacted Amazon
They not only fixed the problem they did it almost instantly and with a smile
The books arrived a few days later in perfect shape thanks amazon Also the Books are great
First off I want to make it clear that I respect the people who love and enjoy this novel
I do not think that their opinion of it is somehow wrong
The following however has been my experience Among East Asian classics and among Chinese classics this novel is one of the least accessible to the average Englishspeaking reader
The way in which the story is told is extremely dry and downright baffling to someone schooled in Western literature
The writing had no emotional resonance ever
The lack of emotional resonance is expected seeing as theres very little description of anything beside physical occurrences which are summarized in very succinct form
i.e
Character  stabbed Character  then rode to the city of JFDFSDG and stabbed Character 
This sort of sentence compromises the entire book
Basically it reads like a reference work
Its not a novel as most western readers would be accustomed to thinking of one
Even if youre open to forms of literature that are drastically different from anything else youve read as I was going into this youll probably find yourself too exasperated by the novel to finish
It was really a painful experience for me
However all is not lost for the person seeking an entry into Chinese literature
I recommend Dream of the Red Chamber as a good starting novel especially the translation published by Penguin under the title The Story of the Stone dont be discouraged by the alternative title its the same novel as Dream of the Red Chamber
Furthermore Red Chamber was written in the late Qing which makes it more relevant to the modern history and identity of the region we know as China
Those looking for older quality pieces of writing from East Asia as a whole may enjoy The Tale of Genji and The Tale of the Heike more than they would enjoy Three Kingdoms
Both Genji and Heike are lengthy novels of Japanese origin with Genji often being considered the worlds first written novel and certainly the first in East Asia
To all Good luck in your readings.
I have not bought this kindle version
 I almost did but i previewed it first
If the preview reflects the final product then this is appalling
How can amazon put this up for sale PREVIEW IT BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT.
Book is well written and fairly easy to understand
I mainly just love the subject matter.
seller worked with me in a calm and speedy manner while thanksgiving was going on to resolve a shipping issue
product arrived very fast and in great condition.
One of the greatest book of Chinese literature
good books
Im assuming anyone interested enough to read through reviews of Three Kingdoms needs no convincing in terms of the story itself
It is without questions a superb epic and more than worth anyones time of which you will need a lot if you are to finish it
In light of this my review will focus specifically on Moss Robertss unabridged edition of Three Kingdoms
To anyone wondering whether to go with BrewettTaylors s translation or this one I say look no further
To begin with Moss Roberts translation uses the all but universally adopted system of Pinyin whereas BrewettTaylors published before Pinyin was devised used the WadeGiles romanisation system  now out of use everywhere except Taiwan
Thus when Moss Roberts writes Cao Cao and Sima Yi BrewettTaylor writes Tsao Tsao and Ssuma Ii
Not only are the Pinyin names in wider use now they are also easier to read
Secondly the language is far more accessible in the Moss Roberts version
This is not to say that it is dumbed down  quite the contrary
The translations of the poems and couplets are beautifully rendered and capture the emotional tone conveyed in the original Chinese very well they even rhyme most of the time
Lastly this revised edition contains a long list of vital characters footnotes an expanded set of illustrations and maps the maps come in handy when trying to visualise key battles and events
There is also a superb afterword which at  pages long does a great job of contextualising the novel in terms of its place in Chinese culture and historiography
It sorts fact from fiction for anyone interested in the historical aspect of the novel it is after all a romanticised and often fictionalised account of the period
These three facts alone place the updated Moss Roberts edition far above BrewettTaylors in my opinion
Nevertheless this edition is not without flaws and I would be remiss not to point them out
Firstly there are the typos
Its a shame that the editor didnt or couldnt to sift through them in earnest as they are both numerous and grating
Secondly the quality of the cover the box and the paper doesnt live up to the content  particularly given its cultural and historical significance
Lastly  and this is the big one  there are the spoilers
Yes you heard me
The spoilers
While the introduction and the footnotes do a superb job of clarifying contextualising and elaborating they are also often guilty of revealing the turn of events long before the reader has got to that part of the story
Thus we are told the ultimate fate of Liu Bei Zhuge Liang Cao Cao the Wei the Southland and the Shu far in advance of getting there ourselves
Unless Moss Roberts thought that only those already versed in the historical period of the Three Kingdoms would read this I cannot fathom why he would deem it appropriate or even necessary to reveal such things to the reader without warning him first
I suppose this was published before the phrase spoiler alert was coined
I would therefore be inclined to recommend that readers who wish to remain unspoiled avoid the introduction and the footnotes sections altogether
However given how useful the footnotes actually are for the most part in terms of aiding the reader through esoteric references to historical figures historical events and cultural themes I cannot endorse that recommendation fully
It is a shame because the footnotes are essential to all but the most well versed sinologists and yet they ultimately rob the reader of the pleasure of being surprised at crucial points in the story
However despite these flaws I still loved Moss Robertss edition
Its easy to tell how enamoured and engrossed he was by this story and his passion shines through in this beautiful translation promising to make for a spectacular read
I for one look forward to rereading it in the future.
I bought this way back in  and I didnt finish it until 
I wasnt reading it continously the whole time  on and off rereading parts when I left it for too long
I think I read the first volume  times
This generally is not a hugely enjoyable read when reading it but Im still glad I did
There are  volumes in a slightly flimsy cardboard cover to keep them together
The pages themselves are extremely thin paperthin..
but even though I traveled a fair amount with some of these books stuffed in a bag the pages never got ripped etc
The pages maybe need to be this thin so that the books arent ridiculously thick
There are some pictures and maps in the books but I didnt use them that much
You will need a second bookmark so that you can refer to the footnotes at the back of the book that are constant throughout the books
Often these footnotes give an alternative translation from another source which arent that useful hut sometimes you need them  a character may have last appeared  pages ago and you need a reminder of who they are
The translation seems pretty coherent at least but certainly doesnt portray the poetic nature of the original Chinese
At the time I bought this there was one other translation version that the reviews said is more poetic I think it has actually been uploaded to read for free online since its from the s or something
I chose this one for no partucular reason but for me Im glad I did because trying to read this is a semipoetic language woypd have increased the challenge even more
But maybe thats just me I couldnt finish LoTR...
Three Kingdoms is for the uninitiated a partly fictional account of the events leading up to the transition from the Han Empire to the Jin Empire in China during the last part of the rd Century
 The story is in the Far East an iconic tale with characters and events spawning idioms and influencing the actions of strategists general and rulers for centuries to come not to mention the countless media interpretations such as the John Woo  movie Red Cliff and the video game Dynasty Warriors series
The entire story covers almost  years and the breadth of characters and affiliations in the era is so great that it was inevitable  in addition to bias  that the carriers of the tale would caricature most of it to create a simple good vs
evil tale
 So once the several hundred pages of setup are complete  which is good in itself as the united heroes face rebel Yellow Scarves scheming eunuchs evil Dong Zhuo valiant Lu Bu and arrogant Yuan Shao  the story turns into a struggle between the virtuous Liu Bei the treacherous Cao Cao and the opportunistic Sun Quan
 But its the supporting cast that really make the story work the iconic Guan Yu and Zhao Zilong the semicomedic Zhang Fei and the multigifted strategist Zhuge Liang carry Liu Beis cause fearsome Zhang Liao enduring Zhang He and the Machiavellian Sima Yi fight for Cao Cao while the jealous genius Zhou Yu painfully noble Huang Gai and prodigy Lu Xun support Sun Quan
 And thats nowhere near all
 None of the portrayals are historically accurate  some being downright unfair  but it makes an epic read nonetheless
The main attraction is the lack of that aforementioned simplicity however the Wu kingdom provide the Liu Bei cause with the ally they need to defeat Cao Cao at Red Cliffs but end up being the cause of his downfall later as the two sides argue over the provinces of Jingzhou
 And after that well..
read and learn
 The plot twists of this way power struggle are pretty much the bait and hook with the fate of Guan Yu needing especial mention
It has to be said however that for some readers the style may be uncomfortable not to me personally but other people I have shown the book to have said this
 The story often shifts between the different groups sometimes covering three or more sets of characters at once and many amount to nothing more than exposition
 This version also features a lot of translations of poems and sayings that can to anyone not interested in Chinese culture seem superfluous
 The final  chapters also lack the scope of the earlier ones as all of the main characters are no longer present for whatever reason
 Repetition is something else I hear aimed at this novel well history has an annoying habit of repeating itself with generation after generation refusing to learn from verywelldocumented mistakes
 This is in fact part of the point the novel makes with mistakes seen at the start being repeated by the next generation at the end with similar consequences
All in all this is a book I actually returned to more than once and theres enough to keep a person looking for depth and scope reading for a long time to come its already been a staple read in China for  years so there you have it
But for Reader Lites out there there are other ways to enjoy the story..
other book translations John Woos Red Cliff subtitled copies of CCTVs part TV series and I even understand theres a graphic novel version if you know where to look
Either way give this tale a try you wont be disappointed.
I bought this set of books a while ago because they looked interesting
I am also a huge fan of the war which happened in China as I played the Dynasty Warriors franchise from number  and have watched the red cliff films which are about the war
This book is well written and tells the war the right way which is very interesting and amazing to read
A truly inspirational book as it brings together different types of character and you see what way they approach the war and deal with it.
This set of books is defiantly worth the buy if youre into Chinese history and its ancient tales However i only give  stars to this product overall simply because the box the four books come in is very thin and not very well made and the books themselves have paper that seems to be about the same thickness as bible paper P But its not really a problem just somewhat cheaply made to keep the cost down I suppose but worth it D Just be careful when reading not to tare pages 
Edition is as described  what more could one want Paper is a bit thin and cheap but that doesnt really bother me
This isnt the full version
Its a stupid comic book despite the description saying its the full book
Often the narrative is a little unusual when put into the modern context but if you have a love of history or even just the video game Dynasty Warriors then this is the perfect book for you
Bit long though...
A huge novel.
brought this for my friend in poland and he said he FIN loves it
Great item and excellent customer service
Delivery was timely
 Book was in good condition but I underestimate the difficulty in reading such small print in a tight format
The print was much too close to the spine to properly pick out the last words of a line
The book is much needed so I ordered a more readable format.
No resulta sencillo traducir una obra escrita en chino del siglo XIV
La traduccin de Moss Roberts  est considera por muchos como la mejor fiel al original fluida con abundantes notas aclaratorias
La edicin en cuatro pequeos tomos es muy manejable.
I am just one of the many people who enjoyed reading the Three Kingdoms
What I have to mention however is the terrifying amount of spelling mistakes and the bad overall quality of printing
To give you one of many examples In Volume  about one quarter of the text section on a certain page was completely missing
Soon afterwards I discovered that lost part printed over the lines of the next page
Those pages were completely incomprehensible.I might just have had bad luck with my copy at least I really hope no one else received one of those.
A very good translation with notes amendments versions and expanding historical information
The full work in just four volumes.
Sehr hochwertige Aufmachung
 Top verarbeitet und gut verpackt
Es war ein Geschenk fr meinen Schatz und er hat sich wirklich sehr gefreut
 Definitiv empfehlenswert
Those people who are upset about typos...it does not occur very often and any decently educated person should be able to selfcorrect the typos easily so...suck it up whiners.
You havent red that book yet What are you waiting for Although there is a lot of romance not implicitly the history facts are present and you can learn a lot in the department of human behavior and interactions.
I can say that for the price the quality is good indeed
The paper of the pages is thin but nevertheless it feels good to read
Actually it has its good points because the Novel is quite long and like this it doesnt take up much space
That is helpful when you  like me  are a person who still likes to carry real books everywhere you go
All in all thumbs up
I havent even read the book but feels WORST and DISAPPOINTED
Why couldn you mention that this is completely pictures like the scanned pages..
You cant zoom in or zoom out..
Fonts are too small to read through
Very bad.
Along with the Water Margin its one of the greatest chinese novels
It should be a must read
It arrived in one day in good condition
Wonderful introduction to Chinese history
Complex characters detailed history and reads like a dream
A must for anyone interested in China.
While the story itself is a masterpiece as well as it coming in an attractive box this version has an issue making a segment of the story unreadable
Pages  are completely blank folded into the spine of the book itself or missing
It may have been just misfortune on my behalf but this misfortune thoroughly ruined a good book for me
A smaller annoyance is the fact that the pages are so thin that the text from the other pages leak through quite easily.
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE SET WAS PRINTED IN CHINAI WAS UNSURE ABOUT THE PURCHASE
I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE PRINT IS PRETTY GOOD AND ALTHOUGH THE BOOKS IN THE SET ARE  THEY LOOK LIKE AVERAGE BOOKS NOT TOO BIG.
Die Bcher kamen in dem erwarteten Zeitraum an haben eine gute Qualitt und ich freu mich darauf sie zu lesen
Bisher waren keine Mngel zu erkennen und der Preis war wirklich angemessen.
Bought it for my son  it was exactly as he expected
Rapide et bon tat
One of the best translations of a wonderful classic
I really love Three Kingdoms novel and is the third time Im reading it.
good
One of the best books ever...a masterpiece
I really recommend it The translation is quite good indeed
A perfect .
This was exactly as ordered
This version is the correct and true interpretation of the original books
Very pleased
The delivery has been fast and punctual
The collection is in very good conditions
I recommend to use their services.
This is a semihistorical epic set about  years ago telling of the growth of factionalisation and political intrigue in China that resulted in outright war
Essentially this is a story of a number of heroic figures and the battles they wage with each other
The main characters are pretty interesting particularly the deviously clever Cao Cao
But the story lacks the fantastical element of Outlaws of the Marsh Vol   or indeed its humour
Its certainly a more challenging read
The notes to the edition are excellent so if you want to know about the history of this period and see this in a semifictional context  think Tacitus The Annals of Imperial Rome Classics if youve read him  then this is great
It just wasnt interesting enough to hold my attention for the  pages it takes to reach its conclusion.
Edtion sympathique illustre au prix abordable
A lire avec les trois autres grands classiques de la littrature Chinoise Outlaws of the Marsh Journey to the West et A Dream of Red Mansions.
The original version is super.
 tomes format poche
Satisfait
Il sagit bel et bien de ldition complte en quatre volumes sous coffret
Evidemment cest en anglais
It really is the complete publication in a fourvolume set
Enjoy
This was a Christmas present and the recipient said it was super to read so there is not much else I can say about it
It takes well over  pages to get past the initial and perpetual internicine military battles and skirmishes all of which are described summarily
When the book finally lets up on the constant military skirmishes and battles it does so only briefly and in doing so becomes somewhat more nuanced with some scheming lying backstabbing etc
Opportunism abounds in these sections and often but not always trumps loyalty and honor  changing factions and turning on ones leader is a fairly common occurence here
At  pages in the book has only very briefly broken free of its military confines  Three Kingdoms mainly deals with a power struggle the outcome of which is determined mostly through military actions
As far as I can tell there is little to be found in the book that isnt related to this aforesaid power struggle and associated skirmishes and battles so its not going to appeal to people who are looking for something profound or insightful outside of military tactics
Initially I enjoyed the simple straighthtforwardness of it despite finding it to be lacking in more subtle forms of expression such as can be found in other classics such as The Tale of Genji Hamlet or The Brothers Karamazov for instance
Ive grown tired of it though as military scheming and fighting is virtually all the book is about and at that it isnt done very well especially by modern standards  just brief matter of fact accounts along the lines of Then he struck  a single blow and he fell dead from his horse
I usually have lots of patience for older literature I read and enjoyed War And Peace Don Quixote and the unabridged Life Of Johnson and countless other old books for example but I fear my patience has run out here...essentally its been a waste of time and money bought the whole unabridged Moss Roberts translation
I kept reading it due to all the positive reviews hoping it would improve.
My fault but I didnt realise it was a comicgraphic novel.
 Moss RobertsTaylorTaylor RobertsTaylorPinyinRobertsPinyinTaylorWadeWade Taylor
Although the its not a sidebyside translation the translators grasp of Chinese language is topnotch matched only by his creative English writing
As for the original book itself its very long story with hundreds of characters and twists and turns like the Game of Thrones except the stories are based on a vivid part of Chinese history.
Useless
If youre familiar with any Chinese folklore its probably this story
But you probably know it as Journey to the West
 Its not only been released in numerous editions as a novel its also been adapted for film stage play and Im sure there must be a video game of it out there
If youre thinking Chinese folklore Sounds boring
Think again
This is a superhero story
Monkey also known as the MonkeyKing and Great Sage Equal to Heaven is an immortal who has all manner of supernatural powers
He can fly
He can make copies of himself
He can transform himselfeither disguising himself as another being or appearing as an inanimate object
He has an iron truncheon that can be the size of a sewing needle or a mile long and which is indestructible
Wielding said staff he can defeat armies or deities
In fact the flaw in this story isnt a lack of adventure or thrill
On the contrary its one adventure after the next
If anything the flaw is Superman Syndrome
Thats what I call it when the hero is so ridiculously overpowered that even when hes fighting gods dragons or whole armies theres still no doubt about the outcome
Of course the Monkey does eventually meet his match in the form of the Buddha
The Buddha defeats Monkey not in combat but in a bet
 That event shifts the direction of the story
In the early chapters Monkey is goes about heaven and earth arrogantly wreaking havoc
Hes not altogether detestable
He does have his redeeming traits but hes insufferably arrogant and mischievous
After hes imprisoned following his runin with the Buddha a monk is assigned to go to India to bring back scriptures hence a journey to the west to China
Monkey is assigned to be the monks guardian and along with two others that they pick up along the way Pigsy and Sandy the monk is escorted on his journey
The party faces one challenge after the next and the trip is long and arduous
Some of the challenges require brute force but in many cases they are battles of wits
So while Monkey may be overpowered he does experience personal growth over the course of the story
The story is told over  chapters each set up with a cliffhanger
I enjoyed this translation by Arthur Waley
It is endnoted which is useful given the historic and cultural nuances that may not be clear to readers
It should be noted that this is unambiguously a Buddhist tale
There is a bias against Taoists and other nonBuddhist religions evident throughout the story
Its not just the fact that the Buddha easily defeats Monkey when no other deity or group of deities can theres a steady stream of antiTaoist sentiment
So Taoists and Chinese Folk Religion practitioners be warned I guess
I would recommend this book for fiction readers particularly if you have an interest in the superhero genre or Chinese literature.
This version of Journey to the West exudes a perfumed wind
Waley is the greatest of translators from Chinese
 While this is abridged and cannot match the magisterial but stiffer version of Anthony Yu it is just right for an introduction to this fabulous work
Many who read this will want to tackle Yu
Many others would not wish it longer than it is
Waley occupies a happy position at the boundary between these two groups.
Wonderfully funny and sometimes poignant ancient classic novel about pilgrimage by the wild and resourceful Monkey King and the diffident Tripitaka Monkeys nominal master
Heres one of my favorite quotes from the novel
They travelled on for many days and autumn had already come when late one evening Tripitaka reined in his horse and said Disciple where are we going to halt tonight  Master said Monkey that is a question for ordinary men to ask not for such pilgrims as we
Wherein lies the difference asked Tripitaka
 Ordinary people at this hour said Monkey are hugging their children or cuddling their wives in soft beds under warm coverlets lying snug and comfortable as you please
 But how can we pilgrims expect any such thing  By moonlight or starlight on we must go supping on the air and braving the wet so long as the road lasts.
This is a funny book as well as quite a serious one
Keeping an open mind while reading makes for a better experience
 Monkey is a lot like you and me
 He does the hard work to become enlightened and a standout person only to become a stronger egocentric narcissus blind to the rights and feelings of others
 But he is finally chastised for his behavior and learns to be true to his word and use his powers to help others and in the process does not lose any of his essential essence that makes him who he is
 It is a fine tale masterfully written and fun to read
 There is a reminder here that we all have something of a Monkey Mind inside us.
Its journey to the west but in a more compact read
 The monk travels westward to spread buddhism but has quite a journey
 The read journey to the west is too long for undergraduate students
 So I can assign this to them since is only about  pages
 The full length translation by the same person is  volumes and about  pages
 I recommend the full length version if you are reading for your personal enrichment of reading a Chinese classic
 If you just want a quick read to understand the legend better than any movie TV show or childrens book then this is a fine abridged version of the translation I enjoy most and bought the last time I was in China
 To be honest none of the popular culture shows or childrens books I have seen here or in China are anywhere close to the actual book
 They just borrow some of the characters and call it Monkey King
 This is the real deal and thus HIGHLY RECOMMENDED One of my favorites ever
The prechosen descriptions of the plot mood characters and pace that Amazon provides are no match for the wonder of the book
Monkey has entertained children and elders in China for  years
There are movies songs and spinoff tales
Donnie Yen just did a new movie in  based on this bookand in  Journey to the West was released in theaters
Thats the mark of a book with staying power  Its a fun read with twists and turns and magic and all the splendor and wonder you expect from China  years ago
Think of the most sensational and unreal KungFu movie you ever saw with flying swords and beasts and rooftop fights magic fists Crouching Tigers and Dragons and mystery
That is this book in its ancient glory
You may love this or you may find your child enthralled with the characters plot and wonder of Sun Wukong the Monkey King or the Jade Princess or the demon catcher...
Monkey is an incredible tale that I read as a child and am looking forward to reading again as an adult
I was so happy to see this reprint in paperback
The story itself is a wonderful comedic adventure that provides insights into Taoism Buddhism and Confucianism as well as satirizes Chinese society of the th century
Monkey is as to be expected hilarious
There are many reviews of the story if you search the internet so Ill not waste your time writing what others have already written
 Just know youll enjoy
Some people know the character Son Goku from the Japanese cartoon series Dragon Ball Z
 Others are familiar with Pokemons Infernape
 And still more know a similar character from a TV miniseries shown in the US in  called The Lost Empire
 Rumor has it that Jet Li will collaborate with Jackie Chan to portray a Sun Wukonglike character in the forthcoming movie The Forbidden Kingdom
 What fans of these characters may not know is that they are all based on Chinas infamous Sun Wukongor The Monkey King
The tale of the Sun Wukong is one of the four major Chinese literary classics
 His chapter story called Journey to the West Xi You Ji was written by Wu ChenEn  in the s
 Monkeys legend is based on the true story of a wellknown monk Xuan Zang  who traveled to Inida to bring the Sutrathe Buddhist holy bookto China to enlighten the people and improve their lives
 In Journey to the West however reality gives way to a much more entertaining and fantastic version of the story
Journey to the West is a heros quest elaborated with Monkeys supernatural powers interlaced with Taoist and Buddhist practices and beliefs as well as common superstitions embellished with fairy tales monster stories legends and fables
 Some of the chapters read like superhero comics others like instructional Bible stories
 Some parts of the story as when Monkey Pigsy and Sandy are hiding in a Temple and outwit the priests are downright hilarious
 The Sun Wukong legend can be read as a herojourneyquest a political and social satire of rebellion against a corrupt government or as pure fancy
 No wonder Journey to the West has endured for so long
Its hard to believe that as popular as Journey to the West has remained over the centuries its author would never have admitted to writing it
 Wu ChenEn was a scholar and a statesman
 During the s Ming Dynasty it was considered unfit for educated and high ranking men to read any kind of comic or popular literature
 Wu was influenced in writing this tale by the superhero stories he read secretly while in school
The entertaining escapades of Sun Wukong have remained popular through the ages inspiring operas cartoons and now movies
 The tale has even spawned a Sun Wukong festival which features recreations of many of his adventures and a statue of Monkey stands at a Buddhist temple in Sau Mau Ping in Hong Kong
 Chairman Mao was also a fan who mentioned Monkey as a role model in many of his speeches
 He said people should emulate Monkeys fearlessness in thinking doing work striving for his objectives and extricating China from poverty
 Sun Wukong is wellknown and wellliked in modern times among children in Vietnam Thailand Japan and Korea
 I think Wu ChenEn would secretly be very pleased
Monkey or the Monkey King or The Journey to the West is one of the great epic novels in Chinese culture
 Set in the th century but not written in the current form until the th century it was part of an oral tradition before that the story is on the surface about the pilgrimmage of a Buddhist Priest Hsuan Tsang and his  disciplessidekicks Monkey Pigsy and Sandy as they journey to India to bring back sacred scrolls from Buddha
 Arthur Waley has done a truly impressive job of translating editing and bringing to life a selection of the stories  from  original chapters from the original Chinese book
 He retains the complete first section about Monkey  How he was born from a stone the trouble and mischief he caused on earth and in heaven and how he reached the title of Sage Equal of Heaven until getting imprisoned in a stone under a mountain
 Waley then presents a selection of the adventures that the  cohorts encounter in their journey to find the scrolls
 Each of the adventures follow the same theme of encounter a difficulty i.e
some people in trouble help the people to overcome the difficulty usually through magical or supernatural powers and then move on
 By translating an abridgement it prevents this repetitive style from dragging on and it stays fresh
 In addition to the basic story line one learns much about ancient Chinese culture Buddhism and some about Taoism
 Moreover the  pilgrims rather than being model characters are actually quite flawed which makes the stories fascinating because it always requires a group effort to surpass each hurdle
 This is a wonderful book
 Translating from contemporary Chinese to English is difficult enough but from th century Chinese Waley has done an amazing job.
Monkey is the story of the Monkeyking acting as a guarding of a Buddhist monk in his travels to the west
Dont let this description mislead you
It is not a lofty religious book
It IS an actionpacked adventure thriller with some touches of philosophy and fantasy
What I liked most about this book it is that it does not obey the norms or guidelines of western literature
The heroes can be cowards betrayal is completely expected good and evil are not opposites
Very refreshing and keeps you on your mental toes
Highly recommended
Mama used to read between bites at the dinner table to keep seven kids quiet and interested and let Dad enjoy his dinner
She looked for books that had a beautiful flow to the language that would attract even the baby simple enough basic story lines that the little kids would enjoy it enough adventure to attract the middle kids and deeper subtler meanings to engage the older kids and adults
This one Monkey by Wu Chengen translated by Arthur Whaley was top contender and I heard it read aloud many times in my childhood always with enjoyment always learning more
The other mostrepeated books were Kiplings Kim and Tolkeins The Hobbit
  It is the story of the irreverent magic Monkey King who had adventures on earth tricked a sage into teaching him the secrets of magic and immortality and then created havoc on earth and in the beaurocracy of heaven
Mama explained that the idea of beaurocracy is deeply ingrained and that people tend to imagine their afterlife to be ideal versions of what this one might be
As punishment Monkey was imprisoned for  years under the Mountain of the Five Elements and as penance was to accompany and protect the priest Tripitaka on a journey from China to India to bring back copies of sacred scrolls to bring the true teachings of the Buddha to China
They had adventures
And the author pulls us from one to the next with hints
If you do not know how far they still had to travel and whether disasters still awaited them you must listen to what is told in the next chapter.
As an American of Chinese descent I was able to read one of Chinas most famous novels
Although it is the translated version I believe that the author translated it very well
This is my first time reading the Monkey King despite having seen several television adaptions
According to my Chinese professor this book is very true to the original version
Three reasons why I would purchase this 
One of Chinas Most famous novels 
Abridged Version if you are pressed with time 
True to the original version.
Translation is always an incredibly difficult task and this one is between not just different languages and different eras but also different cultures and different philosophies
This is a very readable translation of a portion of the epic at the cost of context and a degree of accuracy
However if you want to just read the story and enjoy it as a story this is probably the best version
Deeper retellings are a slog to get through and unless you really want every drop youre better off with a version youll complete.
The original name of this story is Journey to the West
 It is the Chinese equivalent of Grimms Fairy Tales
 Like Snow White or other beloved Western fairy tales every Chinese child knows this epic story of the Monkey King and his companions journey to the West to seek enlightenment
 Along the way these voyagers encounter demons fairies and other fantastic characters
I had heard this story many times when I was little and I am still enchanted by the story now that I am a parent
 I highly recommend this book for both parents and children
 Each chapter is a complete story so its a great bedtime read.
Ive always been a fan of epics  homer virgil beowulf sir gawain gilgamesh
This is by far the best of them
Its hilarious and fantastical in a way that most storiesbooks of this kind are simply not
I believe it when people say this is one of the best translations out there though its the only one Ive read.
Have really enjoyed this version of this story  I had no problem understanding the author  although it could be I was brought up surrounded by the British accent
 My only problem was that parts of it seemed fainter with a fuzzy static and I turned up the volume it would inevitably go back to normal.
For the most part I enjoyed the story
There were times where parts of the story seemed to be glanced over and other less detailed parts seemed to be dragged out longer than needed
Granted this is an abridged translation so it could be something lost in translation or just missing from the abridged version.
This novel  and it is much more than that  is considered by the majority of people in the world Asian  one of if not the absolute greatest writing of all time
 Shakespear but with more fun meaning and breadth of meaning and effect  to each  and through each stage of life
It is originally written in  good sized books and has been translated to English as well as other languages many times
 In many things translated it is hard to reflect the flow and cadence of things as well as reflect the sometimes culturally derived understandings and appreciations of things and so much more
 Especially true with this where not only are there magnificent stories a poetry and social commentary and more in one
This abridged version notes it tries to capture only the major and translatable stories in this absolutely magnificent piece of literature while maintaining as literal translation of the words as possible
 Great writings dreams if you will are great almost in spite of dialect not just because of them
 This is an example of that
The selections and presentation succeeds in all regards and you are swept into the writing and can feel and be washed away in joy and thought by it
 It is entirely comfortable for we US type readers
 So great is what you get that it even makes me jealous of those who have the ability  to enjoy it exactly as it was written  as many have said for generations  it can be life alteringly powerful
This is a very approachable read for anyone with a USanglo perspective  and as recommended to me  the best one from that point of view.
This book is fun
The book itself was used and came exactly as advertised with no tears or bad markings
I would definitely used this seller again
As for the book itself the story is fun intriguing and timeless
I would highly recommend.
This is a stunning translation of an inherently beautiful story of adventure and spirituality
The selection of stories is careful and coherent while the language is readable and entertaining
Its amazing how Waley captured so many of the jokes and digs in here
Kindle version worked fine.
This is a classic fairy tail
It is Chinas equivalent of the Brothers Grimm
If you enjoy fairy tales you should buy this as it is well written and not tedious as other versions are
Aurthur Waley did an excellent job of making the story a joy to read
You can even read this book to your children the same way you would read any fairy tale book to children
It is nicely organized with each chapter as a separate episode or story that allows for a pause between chapters without losing the overall arc of the story
It is entertaining and has hidden gems of both wisdom and mystical teachings for those who have the eyes to see
In other words you can learn advanced spiritual alchemy from this book if you are paying attention
Secret lore hidden in a fairy tale Ironically...it also shows Buddhisms nastier side
Few people know that even the Buddha himself had no problem using force to convince others of the superiority of his argument
Or that there is no such thing as mercy and forgiveness in Buddhism
The wheel of Karma...divine punishment..
is merciless and inescapable
And refusing to bow down and know your proper place in the hierarchy..
is an unpardonable sin
A great read
I bought this book as a gift and the person likes the story very much I also read this version several pages and from these several pages I can tell the translation is superb
I myself have enjoyed this book in the original Chinese edition and have loved it since I first read it
The Monkey is such a beloved trickster hero that everyone knows and adores in China and many countries of Asia
Highly recommend this book for your whole family
I grew up on Journey to the West having read it in various Chinese versions catered for easier reading childrens books even comic books
This translation captures so much of the same humor and personalities of the characters that it was just as enjoyable as the Chinese version
But a big downside is that its missing so many of the best adventures of the original story
That means we miss out on many of the Monkeys crazier transformations the beasts and gods and their magic and weapons and more of the interpersonal conflicts between the main characters
It was like reading part  of a trilogy I wish he had simply translated more
Nevertheless if you are new to this story this is not to be misseda very good introduction to one of the greatest Chinese stories ever written.
Everyone you meet in China is likely to have read this so youll have something to talk about if you visit
Youll also see references to it in Chinese life and literature
Beyond that its an entertaining and insightful read
As exasperating as Monkey is you should come to love The Great Sage Equal of Heaven.
This is a collection of traditional tales from an early China
 It was tongueincheek even then but allows a view into another culture
 And in the end it is a redemptive tale in a Buddhist tradition.
A fun read with fun characters Monkey and Pigsy being my favorites
Their banter and Monkeys with pretty much anyone is priceless.
Very good fairy tale at first I thought it might be just Monkeys story but this is a translation of Journey to the West
Its a great translation that keep things moving and carries through the humor of the story
 Unfortunately the printing is low quality
 Issues such as shown in the photo on many pages.
Charming tale in generally maybe the best version of it and the Kindle edition is very readable.
good
The copy that Amazon sent was misbound at the printer pages  through  appear twice in succession while pages  through  are missing
My copy is the th printing of the th edition Grove Press
Unless you can confirm in advance that your copy will be a corrected printing or you are willing to return the book I recommend getting the book where you can inspect it first
Note Im required to give the book a star rating in order to post this warning
Please discount this rating as an evaluation of the books content.
An exciting adventure story fleshed out with religious philosophies and historical references
Ive never read the original Chinese version so I cant compare but this abridged translation is still a standout book.
I read this book at least  times in my past
It was one my ex husbands favorite books
When I read the story it made me feel very happy inside
He lost the book in his many moves
So I purchased it as a Christmas present and he was delighted to receive it.
item as described
My daughter was assigned this book in her th grade Humanities class
 She really enjoyed reading the book and creating her own caricature of what the monkey look like to her.
I picked this book up after a friend told me it was a classic in China and I didnt honestly expect to enjoy it much
But the first half of the book had me totally engrossed
The second half I enjoyed less
It seemed written by a different author is translated less elegantly
Still I fully recommend it.
Came brand new with no rips or bends.
First foray into Chinese literature went over very well
Really this book is a fantastic read
well written moves fast very entertaining and a joy to read
So glad I have a copy...this is a keeper.
My daughter had this book for a reading assignment during thanksgiving break and I had to get a copy for myself plus another one to share
Anyone reading Monkey will identify with the main character at some point if not throughout the book
Highly recommended.
The book gives an interesting insight into cultir differences
Could not put it down
 Going to get the next edition
The reason I got this is because I was told these stories as boy
It is just as entertaining now as it was then.
Great Quality Arrived on time
Beautiful stories.
Before buying this book I also considered buying The Journey to the West by Anthony C
Yu which offers the complete version of the story in several volumes
Monkey  was a very captivating book and I highly recommend reading it
It only seems to end too quickly
Now I am a little sorry I did not choose the complete version.
Great product
As a practicing Buddhist I found it particularly thought provoking and uplifting
 However in places it could do with some additional editing  shonky translations and just plain errors in spelling and grammar but not enough to spoil the read
 I do find it a bit presumptuous to be reviewing a classic  it is what it is.
I actually enjoyed this book had to read it for class
Excellent
You can find traces of the eponymous Monkey or Sun Wukong in modernday superheroes and manga protagonists
One of the classical works that has plenty of humor and is just plain fun to read.
This is the kind of book I can read over and over and I dont normally read a book more than once.
Great version of one of the most sourced stories of all time
Great story.
The cover is a beauty but the inner text is a bit faded.
I used this to introduce myself to Journey to the West since  chapters over several volumes seemed somewhat arduous
I greatly enjoyed this but still feel as though I missed out on something rich by not reading the full novel.
Apparently heaven is very bureaucratic in China e.g
you can get your passport stamped by the guards if you visit
Monkey is the funniest book I ever read
 And the things Monkey does are beyond my wildest expectations
 This book is very well read literature  in Asia
 If I am not in the best mood this book causes me to laugh for days
 Very thought provoking.
ok
Its a gift for my yearold son
 He liked it though this is an abridged version quite a few stories are not in there.
This book is excellent
 Its one of my favorites that I keep coming back to reread every couple of years
 I love the part where monkey bets buddha that he can fly to the edge of existance and flies to what appears to be the  pillars that hold up the universe
 He then pees on one of them and returns to mock buddha
 Buddha smiles tells monkey that he never even left buddhas palm and holds out his hand for monkey to smell
anyways This is a great book and I recomend everyone read it
One of the best stories of all time.
If youre a Harry Potter fan youll love the magic
If youre a college student youll love the highspirited freedom and roaming
If you remember the s this book will remind you of a really good doublebarrel Orange Sunshine trip without any of the negatives.
One of the greatest books ever written.
I liked this book a lot
it was a great metaphor and it was also entertaining to read
This is a delightful book full of side plots and weird characters strange alliances and stranger heroes all set in a time and place and culture we Americans know little about.
Fantastic read
I guess its a classic for a good reason.
Awesome Book...Thank You
A great metaphor for revolutionary minded people
Read this book to the end Great work great jokes Aware of nothi
A OK
Not a book to read for pleasure but an intellectually challenging and historical cultural book.
A Novel In  China was on the verge of becoming a manufacturing and financial juggernaut
By the year  its economy was in shambles and its government paralyzed
What destroyer has invaded this ancient land
This review is not about the translation which is great
 This review concerns the story itself
 As religious allegory its kind of interesting
 But the story is so boring and predictable
 Monkey always wins his battles and outwits his enemies blah blah blah
 The plot is so contrived as to be thoroughly boring
 The story of the journey to the west was so famed that I was curious and purchased this expecting to laugh at monkeys antics
 No laughter here just snoring
 Do not read this for pleasure you will regret it
 Only buy this book if you have to read it for class
 I hear that Arthur Waleys translation is an abridged version of the Chinese original
 I can only surmise that the original is  times as boring.
Everyone likes the story However the printing and binding of this edition is really horrible  cheap paper small fond of printing very bad binding
The ink of most of the pages is very light and fuzzy and the words are just like photo copies from a very old photo copy machine
I bought one copy of Monkey A journey to the West retold by David Kherdian  pages and ten copies of this book Monkey Folk Novel of China translated by Arthur Waley  pages planning to pass to my friends kids for gifts the former page one has much better printing and binding and is good for gifts
But this book the page one absolutely cannot be used as gifts since it looks way too cheap like those from onedollar store and printingfond is absolutely not appropriate for young readers to protect their eyes.
Prevailing amounts of What Why did that just happen I know Asian myths are often told out of order and need to be stitched together and there may be several cases of this would make total sense if you knew the culture of the time yet there are many things that leave me wondering.
I received the book within a few days of placing my order
The book was in great condition 
Would definitely recommend if you are trying to get this book right away
As expected.
There is a sort of give no x attitude in this translation and in other translations which is refreshing
Like the tales tamed by Grimm and sanitized by Disney the Journey to the West has faced similar issues but in this translation wr avoid this for the most part
Murder intrigue dragons getting their heads chopped off by dreaming ministers are just a few of the topics faced in this abridged collection
You can definitely see where so much of dragonball and dragonball z looted from this ancient novel a bit clearer in this translation compared to the more safe movies and tv shows made in the West or for the West
Check it out
It is good to know more about where so many stories and themes originates.
There are some caveats to this review
All translations fail to some extent wordplay and jokes are lost meaningful phrasing is lost
All abridgments will leave out parts that some people love or feel are indispensable
That being said ..
The Grove Press edition of Arthur Waleys translation of has been on my bookshelf since about 
It is not the same physical book
The original fell apart after much rereading
I have let friends borrow the book and have despaired of having it returned
I have read several other translations and none of them satisfy me
Friends who know have told me that the Waley translation is the only one that retains the wit and flavor of the original
I believe that
The next best translation oddly is a translation from Chinese to Czech then from Czech to English
There are things that some people may find offputting about Waleys translation
Those who are finicky about such things may think the deliberate attempt to retain the spirit rather than the exact phrasing to be distasteful
Waleys scholarship was excellent and he could have chosen to write it wordforword but he did not
His version is similar to Coleman Barks translations of Rumi such as  true to the intent meaning and flavor rather than a mechanical replacement of words
The criticism that I would have to agree with is simple there isnt enough of it I know that an abridged version is the best that we could hope for and even so some of the reviewers here have complained of its length but I sometimes hope that a cache of unpublished chapters will be discovered
Until then however the distinctive white black and orange cover of the Grove Press edition of the Arthur Waley translation of Wu Chengens Monkey will have a place of honor on my bookshelves.
In the preface to his translation Waley tells us that the author of MONKEY lived between  and  A.D
 The protagonist of the tales Tripitaka was a real person better known to history as Hsuan Tang who  lived in the seventh century A.D
 There were contemporary accounts of  Hsuan Tangs pilgrimage
 These accounts along with a cycle of fantastic  legends that began appearing around the tenth century A.D
and the stage  presentations which began in the thirteenth century provided the source  material for Wu Chengens wonderful tales
This is Waleys  spelling
The first seven chapters are dedicated to telling Monkeys  story up until the time he became Tripitakas disciple
 Monkey mostly  through trickery has become more powerful than most of the gods and has  rebelled against them until he is finally overpowered and imprisoned in a  block of stone
 He is freed in order to become the first of the three  disciples
In chapters eight through twelve we are introduced to Hsuan  Tsang Tripitaka and learn about the origins of his pilgrimage to India
 The balance of the one hundred chapters are dedicated to the pilgrimage  itself
Early in the pilgrimage Tripitaka acquires two additional  disciples Pigsy and Sandy
 Each of the three disciples has been placed in  Tripitakas path by the gods and each has unique magical powers
 Without  these powers and the support and encouragement of these sometimes  reluctant disciples the pilgrimage would never have been completed as  there are no end of dangers evildoers and monsters to overcome and  because Tripitaka is a rather weak and timid pilgrim who needs constant  encouragement
The pilgrimage does end successfully and Tripitaka and  each of his disciples are rewarded in heaven as follows Tripitaka  becomes the Buddha of Special Merit
Monkey becomes the  Buddha Victorious in Strife
Pigsy becomes Cleanser of  the Altar
and Sandy becomes the Golden Bodied  Arhat
As is befitting for a book about a spiritual though  physically challenging adventure the author ends by dedicating these  hundred chapters to the glory of Buddhas pure land
We are  told that these tales are for the entertainment of children and adults  alike
 While I agree that this is true of the content of the tales it is  my opinion that reading this translation would be difficult for young  children
There are translations available that are written in more child  friendly language
 For any reader of mythology MONKEY should be a welcome  addition to your reading list.
This is the full audio version of Arthur Waleys book Monkey itself an abridgement of Journey to the West
Enjoy one of the pillars of Chinese culture the story that permeates the fabric of Chinese Japanese Korean and Vietnamese film literature and manga from Monkey Monkey to Dragonball as rendered by a brilliant Sinologist while stuck in your car
Kenneth Williams the voice actor wasnt ever given a WadeGiles pronunciation chart and so butchers Xuanzangs name but luckily Waley renders it as Tripitaka for most of the novel which Williams cant get wrong
Williams has a thick Received Pronunciation accent thats the Queens English for you nonBrits which many will find hilarious and which some will find unbearable
The story itself is quite funny in many places even if it does drag and if you think Waleys abridgement is long wait till you see Anthony Yus four volume complete English translation
It was written down some  years ago and was a popular and widespread folk tale for at least  years before then so dont expect the pacing of a st century novel
Monkey masters Daoist magic and after making a name for himself on earth gets invited to Heaven where they can keep an eye on him
He makes a mess of things there then flees back to earth and fights off the Heavenly Courts greatest warriors trying to take him back for punishment
After another stint in Heaven he runs amok and crime of crimes eats the Jade Emperors favorite peaches
Oh boy
For wreaking havoc in Heaven the Buddha himself finally throws Monkey down to earth puts a mountain on top of him and tells him to think about what hes done
Five hundred years later the Buddha takes pity on the barbarians living in China and directs Guanyin the goddess of mercy to order a holy man from China to travel to India to get authentic Buddhist scriptures
She picks Xuanzang of course
The merciful goddess offers Monkey absolution and enlightenment if he lays aside his vile Daosit magicks takes up the one true path of Buddhism and serves Xuanzang on his journey to the west
Monkey has help from a pleasureseeking pig a quiet water spirit and a dragon prince who transforms into a horse all of whom are to be Xuanzangs disciples
Lets just say that priests will do what priests will do and between naughty shenanigans mighty battles and a coup detat the scriptures are fetched from India and conveyed back to China this time by a magic cloud before the whole party is taken back to Buddhas Shangrila to live forever rescued from the wheel of karma and reincarnation
Also available as an MP CD 
This review is from my review there.
Unlike most people I didnt come to this book through the TV series  I have heard of it but Ive never seen it although I do intend to try to find it now...
This translation covers only sections of the MonkeyJourney to the West saga but what there is of it conveys well the flavour of the tale without outstaying its welcome
The plot such as it is revolves around the priest Tripitaka and his disciples including Monkey who have been charged to journey to the West and return with Buddhist scriptures for the enlightenment of China
The story can at times be distinctly difficult to get your head around superficially at least its little more than a succession of episodes involving bizarre monsters being defeated with elaborate magical powers
There is however plenty of humour  generally farcical in nature although occasionally quite dry  and the bickering of the main characters is frequently entertaining
The bureaucratic nature of heaven in which spirits and deities are assigned strictly hierarchical posts  with salaries  is amusing regardless of how much you know of Chinese history and society
However many of the Buddhist and Taoist elements may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the basic concepts
Some of the episodes rely quite heavily on outcomes grounded in say the workings of karma or the achievement of enlightenment  although most do conclude with Monkey and friends beating up the monsters in question frequently with the spiritual aid of Kuanyin and other divinities
But I do suspect that there are allusions and layers Im missing..
To paraphrase the endofchapter refrain if you want to know whether Monkey and his companions succeed on their quest youll have to read the book
Waleys abridged translation of the popular Chinese classic Journey to the West is an approachable version for the initiate but I strongly recommend W
J
F
Jenners excellent full and unabridged translation also available from Amazon
Waleys abridged version concentrates mainly on the beginnings of the pilgrimage e.g
Monkeys origins his bid to overthrow Heaven his subsequent imprisonment his rescue by the holy pilgrim from Tang and the conversion of the other disciples and only a couple of the adventures along the road to Buddhas Western Paradise
Jenners translation spread over four volumes covers all these and much more  a total of  adventures and misadventures spread over  chapters
If you like Waleys translation go on and get Jenners fuller version
Monkey is Chinas version of the universal tricksterhero
Jenner captures all of Wu Cheng Ens sly humour and you cannot help but laugh out loud when you read his translation.
The book itself is pretty good
I dont know if the translation is accurate or not but it was an enjoyable listen except for one little thing
The person Kenneth Williams reading the book had a pretty thick accent
He also is very expressive with his reading
It took a while to get used to the reading of the book.
I was expecting a mildly amusing but somewhat slowgoing novel when I picked up Monkey for my class in Chinese Literature
But I could not put it down and finished the whole of it in two sittings This book is as much of  a page turner as any modern novel using everything from cunning plot turns  to endofchapter guises And if you dont know what became of them  you must listen to what is told in the next chapter
to absolutely  hilarious anecdotes
I laughed aloud at the Taoist Holy Water  episode An amazingly wellcrafted novel with a very very fluid  translation that makes it an absolute delight to read
Again I could not  put this book down The fight scenes were also spectacular...still  panting having just finished the book...you must read this book 
The story of a monkey with a priest In this book nothing as it seems
On the road from China to Gondaro Will they make it Nobody knows
This book titled Monkey is the same Monkey many of us know And most definetly should love from the television series also called Monkey
 They were both taken from writings penned by Wu Chengen who lived between   
 This translation is absolute joy to read
It is the story of a noble Chinese priest on a journey to find the scriptures of India for his God Buddhu
 On his travels he encounters three partmen partanimal partnaughtyandthereforepunished creatures who journey with him in his misadventures in return for going to heaven
It combines in its reading beauty with absurdity profundity with nonsense Folklore allegory religion history satire and poetry
 You will never read anything like this ever again in your life
 SO GO AND BUY IT NOW
A blurb from The Nation describes the book as a combination of picaresque novel fairly tale fabliau Mickey Mouse Davy Crocket and Pilgrims Progress
 I would add to that list The Divine Comedy The Odyssey Huckleberry Finn  Arabian Nights and modern political satire
 But despite the seemingly esoteric description it is a light breezy novel
 The reader doesnt need to know who Lao Tzu is to laugh when he pinches Monkey and tells him Be off with you be off with you and dont let me find you hanging round here heaven anymore
 The reader doesnt need to have a few University years of Chinese fiction or philosophy under the belt before laughing at Monkey stuffing himself with the Jade Emperors peaches
 Nor even does the reader need to be steeped in morality for though having early attained immortality and we all know on fast track for Buddhahood Monkey still likes to crack a dragon joke before clobbering one over the head with his cudgel in a real garlicpounding blow that will finish him off for good and all
Waleys translation flows lightly using a vernacular that is simple easy and inviting and at the same time reminiscent of the sagacity of the veteran Boddhisatvas many of whom make guest appearances
 It is a beautiful wild fun story centered around a stoneborn ape aka Monkey aka Aware of Vacuity who tromps the world over in search of mischief power peaches sacred texts and enlightenment
 Strikingly similar to  Arabian Nights in both form wisdom and content
I wonder whether a knowledge of the True Scriptures would not cause some improvement in them  Do you yourself possess those scriptures asked the Bodhisattvas  Yes three baskets of them said Buddha and the journey begins...
When reading Journey to the West or Monkey one would be so engrossed by the tantalizing action the fairytale like settings and animated characters that one would forget that there are many layers to this book
It is a fairytale as well as a satire and a historical fiction based on the true events of Tan San Zang Tripitaka in the book
With the outline of Tan San Zangs pilgrimage to India to fetch Buddhist scriptures during the arts and cultural Bronze Age of China the Tang Dynasty Journey to the West expands his perilous journey over the Gobi desert Kyrgyzstan and other Silk Road routes to India in an ingenious way
As a satire Monkey unleashes the imagination against the cultural backdrop of China
It plays on the three major religions and ways of thinking of Buddhism Confucianism and Taoism and blatantly and playfully laughs at them
Like a good joke one who pokes fun at oneself it is not hard to see why Monkey has become a favorite Chinese classic touching every mind young and old
Other than being a satire like most fables and fairytales Journey to the West has imbedded moral values that can be found
The characters are fictionalized except for Tripitaka and are governed with checksandbalances
Tripitaka is not too farfetched from the original Tan San Zang conducting the same pilgrimage yet he is portrayed as a feeble monk who often cries like a woman but his tenderness can move his disciples
Monkey or Sun Wu Kong is witty and the most powerful of Tripitakas disciples yet his downfall is his arrogance
Pigsy another disciple is slow but he is nonetheless loyal and brave
Sandy also one of the three disciples is mostly along for the ride but he represents sincerity
Even though a big part of their journey is out of this world taking place in the heavens the underworld or underthesea worlds their lively characters embodying their flaws and assets can be related to by anyone who tried to get along with another person
Lastly the translation of the book by the famous Arthur Waley preserves the comical essence of the book
Furthermore the most important sequences of Journey to the West can be found and enjoyed in his translation of Monkey.
Monkey also known as The Monkey King or The Journey to the West is one of the four great novels of Chinaalong with The Water Margins Dream of the Red Mansion and The Three Kingdoms
 It tells the story in allegorical form of Xuan Zang or Hsuan Tsang a th Century monk who trekked from China to India in search of Buddhist texts his translations of which were a key to the growth of Buddhism in China
 His reallife travelogue is itself considered to be a great work of literature but for purposes of the novel he referred to here as Tripitaka is given a group of comic companions  the Monkey King a kind of trickster god who represents rebelliousness against both heavenly and earthly order  Pigsy a marshal of heaven turned into his animal namesake for attacking a fairy maiden who represents a sort of earthy stolidity and Sandy a kind of sea monster who Waley says represents wholeheartedness whatever that means
The book is intermittently amusing but even in this abridged version is way too long
 Characters motivations and the meanings of most of the action are awfully obscure
 And like any picaresque it is almost purely episode driven without the various episodes necessarily adding up to a coherent and sustained story
 The book is interesting as a cultural relic but if no one told you you wouldnt imagine it to be such an influential text
GRADE  C
are mine exactly
When I read this book for my Chinese literature class this semester I couldnt put it down
Though it is abridged from  to   chapters most of what is removed is not as interesting
The best part  about Arthur Waleys translation of Journey to the West he  renamed it Monkey is that he is one of the first to play up  the very hilarious humor in the book though there is of course a quite  serious religious undertone to the whole thing
This is an amazingly funny  story from the Ming Dynasty which will not disappoint any fan of fantasy  peculiar humor or spiritual quests
A true classic of Asian literature.
My copy of Childhood in Contemporary Cultures edited by Margaret Mead published  warns that the Waley translation includes only thirty out of the one hundred chapters of the original text and many of the most significant episodes have been omitted
A glance through these reviews and I dont see that anyone has caught the fact that this translation contains barely  of the original Chinese book
Admittedly its the only game in town but this is still significant information.
I first recieved this book as a ninth birthday present from an adult friend who lived in Thailand and upon reading its first  chapters the book quickly became my favourite fairy tale
Monkeys absurd arrogance is funny but by the same token his optimism and selfassurance is infectious
He thinks nothing of travelling from heaven to hell and all points in between Solving problems along the way by banging a few heads together or of achieving immortality by stealing peaches
The story of how he got his great weapon A staff used to hammer the Milky Way flat by essentially being the worst guest in history to a much putupon sea dragon is hillarious
The book suprisingly for one written  years ago in a distant land contains some of the besttimed slapstick comedy Ive ever come across
There is even one moment of true toilet humour that will have you reaching for oxygen its so funny
The pace kept up brilliantly the final scene of the books first act in which the forces of Heaven attempt to trap the Monkey King has the air of a Keystone Kops episode by way of JRR Tolkein
However there are also moments of touching and disturbing drama as Monkeys personality gradually shifts from mischievious to almost evil until he is imprisoned beneath a vast mountain and begins the long road to his redemption and eventual enlightement
I havent even talked about the main plot of this wonderful story but it is better if you discover it for yourself
Enjoy
What a wonderful translation of this classic text
Fans of Chineses mythology and the classic Japanese cult TV show will be enthralled by this text
The book appeals to all ages and mental capacities much like an episode of the Simpsons also does
There are many moral messages portrayed and lots of classically funny moments
Read with intense focus of the adventures of the holy fool Tripitaka the over confident Monkey the glutful Pigsy and the philosophical Sandy as they travel to India for the scriptures to save mankind
Enjoy
Translation is a bit old and silly but it has its charms
Worth a read to see if you want to invest in the much longer version.
I have always enjoyed epics
 My current read is The Epic of Gilgamesh the completion of which is frequently interrupted by returns to the masterpiece you are reading about
 Previous to reading Monkey Dantes Divine comedy ranked highest on my list
 My interest in the anime and manga story Dragonball and subsequently Dragonball Z turned me onto the Story of Monkey and The Journey to the West
Comedy is the word I would use to describe Monkey moreso than Dantes work
 The central characters rise to glory is so colorful and intricate one cannot help but laugh
 The introduction of KwanYin brings a serious aspect to the tale and a more admirable goal but the focus on Monkey keeps the nature of the journey in check
 Despite the absurdity of the characters Monkey and Pigsy in particular though not them alone the story maintains a very epic feel
This version up until KwanYins introduction deals very little with all the Buddhist dogma that permeates the story
 Even afterward Monkeys mission is at the forefront
 The author has done a fine job making the tale accessible to everyone being a white American Christian with appreciation for Buddhism and Taoism and has cut much nonessential dialouge
One thing I had to get used to was the structure of the text
 Paragraph breaks are not always used and oftentimes conversations are not broken up in the traditional ..
he said ..
she said format
 Oftentimes many quotes are strung together before you know who is saying what
 The style takes a little getting used to but this book still gets  stars
 BUY THIS BOOK  You will not regret it.
Monkeys audiobook audio is hard to listen to
The transition to digital did not work
Kenneth Williams does a great job narrating and theres a nifty echo effect that adds to the story but..
but..
the audio quality makes it very hard to listen to on modern devices.
Im reading this entertaining book for the sixth time
 I met it over thirty years ago in a college class and now my own students read it in Literature of the NonWestern World
Enjoy some music that somehow fits the book Alan Hovhanesss Mountains and Rivers Without End.
One of the best books Ive read in all my life
The characters have been  borrowed and turned into many different characters in film and animation  but to read the original makes all the imitations pale in comparison
Minus  a few chapters Mr
Waley has achieved the unthinkable the best western  translation of one of Chinas best kept secrets
A stone monkey brought to  life by the powers of heaven and earth and how he was never satisfied until  he got everything he wanted by any means neccesary
Top notch
This inspired me to go out and apply for college and start my own journey
The part i found to be the most engaging is the story of sun wukong aka the monkey king i enjoyed how hard he tried to become equal to the gods and eventually he does
For being such an old tale it still holds up in modern times.
Born from an egg on a mountain top  chakachah Monkey is funky and never stops He knew every magic trick under the sun He teased the gods and everyone and had some fun Oiii you lazy lot  Go out and buy this book do you see its very good I am the great sage equal of heaven  You will read about lots of demons and adventures  yeeess
And that Holy fool Tripitaka
I am disrespectful to demons can you see that I am serious 
Heads up There are several different translations and abridgements of this story one of the great classics of Chinese literature
Make sure and choose a version that is right for you
The stories are neat but a little repetative
I would definately recommend an abridged version
Still the adventures are interesting and give an insight into Chinese culture and mythology.
Monkey is the most deliteful journey to enlightenment
 I am its biggest fan
 I highly encourage anyone and everyone to read it regardless of age or education
 It will teach you most everything you will ever need to know.
My friend likes it
It is good way to learn Eastern Culture.
An easy read written in a simplstic fashion yet remains enthralling
 The religious factor in the book is strong how ever not over whelming
A whitty satire on the beauracracy of the chinese.
Rich robust fascinating.
It worked well enough for my paper.
a fine translation with surprisingly few footnotes but the sheer length and readability make it worth the while
I only rate Monkey  star because I could not get into it
So my review is only based on trying to read a few pages
I suppose I was hoping for something like the Judge Dee stories by Robert van Gulik which have their own lovely simple style
Maybe someday I can get over the energy barrier and give it another try
But if youre a Judge Dee fan dont be sure you can get yourself into this story.
boring book
Wow
As a massive fan of the original Monkey TV show which aired in England in the s I had always been interested in reading the even more original book by Wu Chen En
This is an excellent level book which youd never guess is as old as around  years
Beautifully translated into English but a level of English that is easily accessible to just about anyone
Its a beautiful read and very inspiring if you are travelling somewhere but also inspiring even if youre not
Sometimes the chapters are short and sometimes theyre long but either way they are never boring
Its carefully written and beautifully thought out and I would recommend it to anyone seeking an inspiring read
Its also not too hard to get through
Took me about  days to finish it and I loved every moment.
This is an enjoyable story but so many things seem overviewed in this abridged translation that it leaves me wishing to read the full translated version which I know is available but thought Id try this version first
Whole periods of the story can pass in as little as a paragraph or several years pass without mention and there is no clear timeline
Also the Chinese translation in to English seems wrong in some parts  either by phonetical spelling oddities or interpretation of meanings taken literally instead of understanding a saying or pun
But overall not bad
Id say this is a good general overview of a story but if you want to indulge in to this story it would be better to seek a full translation  which I plan to do someday.
Arthur Waleys translation of Wu Chengens Monkey is lively humorous and captures wonderfully vibrant characterisations of a myriad host of characters chief among them being the eponymous Sage
The storytelling is paced with perfect precision  each chapter feels just long enough with a tantalising closing line leading into the next..
It was unexpectedly delightful and I found myself laughing from page one onward
For pop culture enthusiasts the influences of this tale on Masashi Kishimotos manga Naruto are evident
I am now curious to read more of Arthur Waleys translations particularly The Tale of Genji.
Truly a wonderful book with humour albeit rather simplistic and magic through out
At times the tale itself can ramble but the hijinks of Monkey Sandy Pigsy and Tripitaka keep you hooked
There were a few chapters that to me were nothing more than filler and could have been cut
Overall though if you have an interest in Asian fiction and light hearted romps through distant kingdoms this is for you
A must read for anyone interested in reading Chinese classics
I can see this book being made into a movie one day if it hasnt already
What an intelligent man for the th century
Long live his brilliant read
I hope more people discover this hidden gem
I dont want to say more than that it is very easy to read and at times you feel that youre in Monkeys life.
I read this after having read the excellent San Guo Yan Yi The Three KingdomsRomance of the Three Kingdoms which I would highly recommend and having known a bit about Chinese culture language and literature I went into it knowing what to expect and was delighted that it had surpassed my expectations
Most often referred to as Xi You Ji or Journey to the West it is difficult to appreciate why the author chose to call it Monkey
While the character of Monkey does occupy much of the first part of the book and remains the strongest and Im guessing most peoples favourite character throughout he is still only part of the entourage of characters who face the Journey
Still whats in a title This book is replete with humour both obvious and subtle
It would help if you had a certain understanding of Chinese History and culture in your reading of this book to understand the many references contained within
However even if you dont know a jot about anything to do with China you will still find this book immensely enjoyable and full of quotable wisdoms
It details first the story of the birth of monkey and his fate and then the birth of Tripitaka and then begins the Journey to the West
It might often appear a bit disjointed leaping around topics
For example you begin with the story of Monkey and are then thrown into a seemingly completely unrelated topic
But the way Wu ChengAn has worked all these plots into a coherent story is truly brilliant
Instead of finding it disjointed I found the the jumps kept the book very exciting
While there are certain parts of the plot which I assume are composed according to the epic style of the time for example all the battles take place in rounds or bouts and seem to follow a standardised format of engage and retreatchase these dont detract anything from the novel to one who is used to epic literature for example the battles in the Iliad followed a pattern
In following the path of Tripitaka Monkey Pigsy and Sandy you invariably pick your favourite for each has their own individual personalities and stock epithets
Pigsy is fat and glutenous and fights with a rake  and perhaps is one of the funniest charicatures in the book
Monkey is a mischief maker both loveable and naughty with fabulous powers
Sandy..
doesnt really do much
Tripitaka is hilarious simply because he is portrayed as the hero of this book but spends most of his time being rescued by his disciples It truly is riotous
Thus even if you fail to understand the relationships of the San Jiao Three teachings of Buddhism Daoism Confucianismor the nature of the bureaucracy the way heaven mimics earth you will still find this one of the funniest reads of your life
Enjoy The other three classics of Chinese literature are The Three Kingdoms The Story of the StoneDream of the Red Chamber and The Outlaws of the Marsh and I highly recommend all of them
The basic premise of this novel in Chinese pinyin xiyouji which literally translates to Journey to the West sees a group of four set out on an epic journey to recover the Buddhist sutras from India and bring them to China
On the way they encounter various monsters ghosts and demons trying to stop them
The four represent different sides of human nature their journey to the West actually India mirrors the human journey of life and whilst Heaven is awash with bureaucracy the Earth is littered with challenges and obstacles
The Monkey King is perhaps the most famous character of all bold proud brave and cunning equipped with a magical staff the ability to transform himself into over  different shapes and a whole host of magical powers
Tripitaka is the monk humble kind and naive the epitome of the Buddhist devotee but not averse to reciting a curse that can keep Monkey under control
Pigsy is the third main character representing greed sloth and lust usually to be found eating sleeping or chatting up the ladies
Sandy is the fourth but pretty nondescript member of the group
The story is humorous and satirical
It contains a lot of references to Chinese history and elements of Buddhism and Taoism Daoism which can be a bit confusing if you have no previous knowledge
Arthur Waleys translation is only a fraction of the original tome however and those looking for a genuine translation of equal depth to the original should look elsewhere
Think of this as a distillation of some of the best bits
Perhaps you need to live in China to realise just how important this novel is not just as a piece of historical writing but also in the Chinese contemporary imagination
If youre interested in China and Chinese cultural mythology you should definitely put this on your reading list
I watched Monkey as a kid My parents taught me about Buddha and the stories of Monkey and just when I thought I had forgotten it all I stumbled across this book
I love it so much I keep buying copies for friends
The chapters are very short and detailed with detail from all of Sun WuKongs Monkey King Great Sage of Heaven adventures how did he get to possess the staff Why does he wear a head band that hurts his head Did they get the Buddhist scriptures from India Who was Pigsy and Sandy It actually goes hand in hand with the old TV show really well funnily but is so beautifully translated
I adore this book and take a copy everywhere I go
Good quality binding and cover
This story is vastly underrated
Monkey is a mix of adventure and morality that blends together in an early quest tale that is unlike those found in the West
Although I knew the ending and characters beforehand I had no idea of the variety of adventures they undertake
Well worth a read.
Those of a certain age in the UK will remember the Japanese TV series of a Chinese folk tale well this is the book where it all began
This is the story of a Monk tasked to collect holy scriptures from the India and bring them back to China
On his travels is his accompanied by Monkey a mischievous impatient immortal Monkey King who was punished for causing trouble in Heaven and after  years being stuck under a mountain agrees to protect the priest to atone
Also travelling with the priest in hope of atonement are Pigsy cast down from Heaven in to the form of a pig demon and Sandy also cast down from Heaven into demon form
The English translation leaves a lot of the story out only  chapters versus the original  but still manages to tell a good story
However I would recommend buying the physical book
The Kindle copy contains a number of OCR errors where the publisher has attempted to convert the physical book to an ebook
Even with the latest updated version you will see the odd  or  in place of z  in place of  etc
It is a shame as with just a little bit of effort this could be fixed.
I love the story  added a little more understanding about Chinese culture...........cheers Michael
A charming story to read
Monkey is a very likeable and witty character and this text is easy to read in modern English.
Bought this because I am a fan of the old TV series
Was pleasantly surprised to find that the humour and silliness were not fabricated by TV producers but actually exist in the original text
As a translation of a sixteenth century text youd probably expect the storytelling to be a little dry but I now see how it fit so neatly into a TV format
Ive read this to my son as a bedtime story over many nights and he loved it
Its a real magical story that does not age
Love it.
Remembering the great tv show from my childhood I decided to buy this and was pleasantly surprised to find the book so much better still
Arthur Waleys translation renders it exceedingly accessible to a worldwide audience
A timeless classic.
I bought this as it is what the TV series Monkey was based on
It was brilliant from start to finish as the TV show practically copied this ancient story word for word
Crucial reading for any Monkey fans.
Highly recommend if interested in oriental literature
Simple and easy to read very enjoyable
Amusing characters and plots will keep you hooked.
interesting fun informative
Journey To The West the tale filmed as Monkey is as iconic to many British schoolchildren thanks to the dubbed TV version as the original text is to the Chinese
Whats interesting is how closely the TV stuck to the book One of the great reads
A joy.
I do not tire of reading this
I suffer from complex post traumatic stress disorder and this is of great benefit to me personally on some of the darker days 
I highly recommend it to anyone.
 stars great page turner
Each adventure gets better each time
Monkey is my favorite character who just keeps evolving.
I had heard of this book way back in s  I saw the TV version Journey to the West now reading the book and am almost completed it
Any one interested in myths and legends of China this will teach you a lot I shall read it many times
its the only book I have read twice.
Very interesting and readable book  recommended
Great read
Great condition
I bought this book after running a web search for the TV programme Monkey and thus discovering that the series was based on an ancient Chinese story
This abridged telling of the story is obviously well  translated  the English is very rich and  where some differences in  language could not be literally resolved like when Chinese wordplay were  rendered irrelevant there were useful footnotes
 Waley has gone against  the convention for previous translations of the Monkey story he has  rendered a small section of the saga in its entirety rather than covering  the entire story in a much abridged form
I found the story fairly dense  it is very stylised and so fans of Chinese history and culture will love  it
 I was surprised by how malevolent the Monkey character was and by how  antagonistic the relationships between him and the other main characters  were
For those fellow fans of the TV programme roughly half of the book  comprises the story of Monkey before the TV show  i.e
the story of how he  rose from a simple monkey to become an Immortal and a Monkey King
 The  rest of the book describes the quest of Monkey Sandy Pigsy and Tripitaka  to retrieve scripture scrolls from the Buddhas of India
 This part of the  book was most like the TV show  a series of subquests or episodes with  the team of characters resolving subplots like ridding a village of some  evil ogres who plague and bully them but I found they became slightly  repetitive and hard to follow due to the plethora of DragonKings  heavenly locations and minor deities and the inconsistent wielding of  magical powers which made me think well if you have THAT magic  power why didnt you employ it in the last chapter when it could have  easily got you out of that tight squeeze
The story is full of  allegory and subtle humour and satire  but I suspect it was slightly too  highbrow and subtle and buried in the Chinese imagery and language for me  to appreciate fully
 If you liked the TV series then the familiar names  have some nostalgia value but the book is slightly hard work  and the team  of characters not the jovial tightknit bunch I remember indeed there  exists between the main characters throughout the book a sense of mutual  dislike which gave the book I feel an uneasy and uncomfortable  atmosphere.
Great product loved it
Fascinating tale I just couldnt put down
And excellent translation of this classic.
The book is wonderful.
A decent presentation of the tales of Monkey and his friends
Great read.
Very entertaining read
Excellent quality dispatched instantly a wonderful book
Excellent
Thank you
Beautiful book.
Classic Chinese fictional literature.
Monkey magic is awesome
Worth reading though heavy going at times.
Ive not read anything quite like this before
Comic irreverent alien odd yet easy to read and elegant in a timeless way.
A fantastic read full of adventure humour and a great taste of Chinese culture
yes
A classic from my childhood
Now I can find out how it ends.
great beginning but it gets boring as the monk turns out to be such a crying baby
Ich bin endlich durch und habe wegen Monkeys Frechheiten gegen Autorittspersonen mehrmals kurz auflachen oder schmunzeln mssen
Es liest sich wie eine Satire an Heldenlegenden und ich glaube das ist auch beabsichtigt
Ein wichtigtuerischer kleiner Affe der sich gleich selbst als Knig krnt und das groe himmlische Reich an der Nase herumfhrt
Er bestiehlt beleidigt und verkloppt jeden der ihm krumm kommt und wo er ein Ziel wittert ist er mit Eifer bei der Sache es zu erreichen
Monkey ist ein AntiHeld und seine Geschichte bis heute eine der bekanntesten Legenden aus Asien
Wer DragonBall kennt wird merken warum der Anime von diesem Buch inspiriert wurde
Das Buch ist in Englisch aber tatschlich sehr einfach zu lesen und zu verstehen auch fr nichtMuttersprachler
Ich empfehle trotzdem ein minimum von B sonst schlgt man jedes zweite Wort nach.
I read this in practically no time at all
If youre nervous about reading the unabridged Journey to the West and just want to see if you can get into Monkey this is the book for you.
Es passiert stndig etwas in dieser Geschichte denn die namengebende Hauptfigur ist mit gewaltigen magischen Krften ausgestattet
Ungeheuer und Zauberer werden reihenweise berwltigt und wenn es eng wird kommt noch eine weibliche Gottheit zur Hilfe
Alle zeigen aber auch humorvoll beschriebene menschliche Zge
 Kein mythologische Tiefsinn aber viel Spa.
this adaptation was a funny wild ride
I love fantasy folk tales and adventure so this was a good pick and one of the best class readings I ever had
I suggest reading up on classical Chinese philosophiesreligions adds an extra level of amusement understanding and appreciation for this novel.
Me ha costado encontrar esta edicin es la buena.
A must read for anyone wanting to get a better grip and insights on the ChineseJapanese culture
This story has been a source of inspiration to many different other books mangas and others
Why only  stars With a very interesting beginning the story loses a little interest after Monkey is imprisoned and becomes a disciple
It becomes slow and feels like there wont be anything new happening.
Though the language has been polished for English readers the humor and the intent of the chapters arent lost..
A great read for inquisitive spiritual readers.
Got an older bit damaged  copy different cover same publisher seems like an older edition
Papers all old
New book
Paperback
In a good condition as expected
A cheaper and better bargain than some other hardcover options.
Nice translation
An entertaining read
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
Great Read
All lovers of the s childrens TV programme should read this
It is great fun but is sadly spoiled by some of the worst formatting Ive ever seen
Come on Penguin Classics
We expect more from you.
Bought for my son he thought it was great
A fine Classic .
very good translation glad I received it.
got bored halfway because Monkey is basically a little s
At the time I write this I still havent read it
Still this classic novel is in my to read list for quite some time and I have high expectations for it.
i started to read this book as it was my book club choice  gave up half way through  but loved the last line of each chapter
most unusual dont know what to think
These stories were well written and provide an insight into a religion unknown to many
 There were adventures and trials sorrow and repentance and a task accomplished
 Reading these stories helps all understand the benefits of a life worth living in a honest and righteous way
Many can benefit from a righteous life
Well written
Well translated
This book is a must The monkey kings stories show you some insight on everyday battles that we all face
Maybe not in the form of a monkey or demons flying around
But to take a step back and rethink how you would normally do things.
Awesome story An irrepressible monkey character seeking immortality and defying the very mandate of heaven defying the gods themselves A legend of freedom and bravery for the ages
Received as described and quickly but I should have done more research because this is not my cup of tea.
Absolutely brand new condition I am very happy with this purchase
For those who enjoy mythology and fantastic tales this book is for you
Plenty of fights and battles between supernatural warriors
However the story revolves around the Monkeys personal journey first to gain the knowledge to become powerful and inmortal then his naughty adventures as an inmortal disrupting heaven earth and hell and finally to redeem himself by helping Monk Xuanzang from China get the Buddhist sacred scriptures from the remote West India
 This book is like a Kung Fu flick from the Tang dinasty and its a delightful first step to study the chinese literary tradition.
How fortunate for Hsuantsang the priest traveling to the West to secure authentic Buddhist scriptures from India to carry back to China that he encountered Monkey and Pigsy and Sandy who helped him and guarded him throughout his arduous journey
Read and enjoy this enchanting and celebrated folk tale from China.
splendid insight into the stories that form part of the Asian character today.
I have an interest in learning the Chinese culture and this was recommended to me by a Chinese student who told me that most Chinese students have read this book
Excellent
This dude thanslates funny
This is a well known story I have been familiar with since childhood
I evaluate it based on the accuracy against what I already know.
I bought this book for a World Lit class and while it was an okay read it wasnt my favourite
Still somewhat interesting though just not my taste.
No illustrations and I returned it.
great sink..love it
I LOVE SUN WUKONG GREAT STORY
The book is a nice summary of the rise and fall of the monkey king
IT is great for all those who cannot be bothered reading the big novels
But I have to admit I found it very short
There were time when I was wondering why has this been shortened and why has this event been excluded altogether However for a summary book this version is very good
I enjoyed the funny side of Wukong very much the terribleness of the Pig  and the seriousness of the Master
Something that was really great was to read about their loyalty to each other
The translations were really great but at times there were a few typos
However the storytelling is great I read through the book in two days
It made me want to continue reading to see how each quest ended
I can truly recommend this book to anyone who is somewhat interested in the story of the Xuanzangs journey to the west
It has everything a good book needs humour seriousness action and a deeper meaning

Very good book but the first three hundred pages are very boring but when they meet wan sang it gets like better and also it keeps on repeating the same plot and monkey kills the demons like.
Wonderful book and subject matter but I prefer the penguin classic translation.
A classic which everyone should read
Great condition very have with my purchase
Nice book
Yet as a story you cover the whole journey and you get to discover all the characters
If you want a first contact with Chinese culture in terms of literature go for this one
The full version is almost  pages bigger
Read both I prefer this one.
Etwas sperrig trotz schon erfolgter Krzungen der Originalgeschichte
Viele Kampfesschilderungen die mich persnlich eher langweilen aber dies ist nunmal ein Teil der Geschichte und der bersetzer hat sie schon gekrzt
Darber bleibt die Botschaft dass wir die einzelnen Protagonisten allen voran den Affen allegorisch in uns haben und die beschriebenen Kmpfe sinnbildlich in uns selber statt finden manchmal schwer zu greifen
TRotzdem eine gute Mglichkeit sich dieser in China jedem Kind bekannten Geschichte anzunhern und sie kennen zu lernen.
wonderful book reading

Fantastic
Wu Chengens sixteenthcentury novel Journey to the West tells the story of the pilgrimage of Buddhist monk Xuanzang to the Western Regions of Central Asia and India in order to obtain Buddhist stras and return them to China between  and  CE
Xuanzang wrote his own account in  Great Tang Records on the Western Regions which formed the outline of Wus novel
The novel is a humorous adventure that satires Chinese bureaucracy while also telling an allegory of enlightenment
Many in the EuroAmerican world know elements of the story from Arthur Waleys  abridged translation Monkey A FolkTale of China while some elements of the story inspired Akira Toriyamas Dragon Ball
Along with Luo Guanzhongs fourteenthcentury novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms Shi Naians fourteenthcentury novel Water Margin and Cao Xueqins eighteenthcentury novel Dream of the Red Chamber this novel is one of the Four Classic Novels of Chinese literature
This edition presents the complete novel in four volumes translated by William John Francis Jenner a noted sinologist who completed this translation while working for Foreign Languages Press between 
It features Qing Dynasty illustrations to supplement the text.
This book is a classic and doesnt really need much explanation
With that said there was a particular choice made in translation that I found immensely irritating  U.S
Standard units were used and just substituted in for Chinese units
Li became miles span became foot so on and so forth
The other Chinese Classics dont do this and it was disappointing to see here
There were also some odd translations within the descriptions such as describing instances where monsters were pounded into pulp as like hamburger
These are minor flaws but they still grate.
An excellent translation complete
Very complete
The full tale is very long so most editions are abridged
It is not easy reading for westerners its an ancient Daoist Chinese tale with absolutely no quarter given to modern western minds
However it is definitely worth the effort
This is not considered a classic for nothing
For those not familiar with the story it is a mythological recounting of the adventures of an actual Chinese monk who travelled to India through countless perils
Probably the closest in AngloSaxon tradition is Beowulf which recounts Scandanavian history in the same way
Journey to the West isnt simply high adventure though
Each of the adventures explores specific issues and the Chinese Daoist interpretation
It is thus intended as educational
As a guide to thoughts strange and alien to western minds it is second to none
Teaching stories exist in many ancient cultures but none are as comprehensive.
My daughter was thrilled with book collection and has been avidly reading it since we got it for her at the start of the summer break
I havent read it myself but I will relate that it speaks to her year old sensibilities and she has been enjoying them
Perhaps at some point I will have the time to read the set and see what the fuss is about
 Kort
This is a four volume translation of the great Chinese epic
It is published by the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing
I suspect this a government organization
I do not read Chinese so I cannot say anything about the translation
But I like this version
It is poetic and appears to be completeit is over  pages long
This is a pure translation each of the four volumes has about three notes at the end
There are other translations that explain everything
Those explanations are not essential to enjoying the story
I recommend this version if you just want to read a great story.
First of all this is one of the four greatest classics of China which already merits your attention
To be more specific  this is an epic full of the most diverse adventures in the style of the glorious AncientGreek  Iliad Odyssey and the Tasks of Hercules
However strangely enough this can also be a written description of a computer game full of battles against ferocious dragons monsters and corrupted leaders  religious or civil  passing from level to level till the happy end
The heroes also carry all kinds of special weapons and possess supernatural powers  belonging to a culture that has probably inspired also those very computer games
These heroes purpose is double  fighting against evil creatures and refining their own selves in order to reach heavenly immortality
They are three symbolizing the three parts of each body
The witty Monkey represents the intelligent resourceful brain
The pious monk Sanzang is the compassionate heart and Pig  the villagefool  is the greedy stomach providing the many humorous episodes
In short  never a dull moment
By the way the Monkey also becomes a monk and the unintentional pun Monkeymonk provides us with hilarious instants..
The first chapters describe how Monkey was born from the primordial union between Heaven and Earth from a stoneegg and how he defied the heavenly rulers wrecking havoc in their lofty palaces ruining their peachfeast stealing the pills of immortality winning by ruse a wondrous weapon subduing ferocious dragons as well as many troops of heavenly soldiers being cooked in a furnace just to win allseeing golden pupils erasing his name from the records of the underworld thus making himself immortal  and more such brave and indeed incredible feats  only to be subdued finally by the great Buddha himself
His only way to release himself from his eternal imprisonment is  to help the pious monk Sanzang whose lifestory is most touching make the milesjourney to the west to fetch the scriptures for the impious easterners
On the way theyre surprised by seemingly impossible tasks such as crossing huge seas or lofty ridges and in addition they meet all kinds of unimaginable powerful fiends which they must fight according to the different circumstances
Each battle is described in a short free poem just as the breathtaking views of the mountains brooks rivers storms flowers and birds are described lyrically
Each of the many adventures  about  at least  is selfcontained and so even if the reading stretches over several months  nothings lost
The reading is easy and pleasant and mostly  encouraging  since each battle symbolizes our own daily hardships and so each victory is ours too.
Since the book concentrates mostly on the versatile everlasting fight between Good and Evil with very little romance for example it could be read by any child just like fairystories
And so whoever is looking for a present for a youngster even  years old or whoever is willing to teach a computeraddicted boy or a teenager to dedicate some time to simple reading  this is the book for the task Plus whoever is willing to enjoy a long journey from China to India with everything it has to offer  sceneries people trades spirituality vices different habits of many countries  at least twelve are mentioned  and also visit many levels of heaven and even the underworld on the way  and get out of it intact  all this without leaving the comfortable home and even bed  especially during long cold nights  just step out and invest in buying this book  its simply indispensable  A personal confession  I happened to be born in the Year of the Monkey according to the Chinese astrology and on the day of the Monkey according to the Mexican astrology  so Im a double Monkey and Id detested it Till Ive completed the reading of this book
Now I can be proud of myself just for having such a representative in one of the most fascinating specimens of the world literature  the most charming Monkey youll ever meet 
I am so happy I bought this edition of the series It arrived on time in great condition
I have been wanting to read this book and am very happy with this particular translation
It is written is a poetic yet easily understandable way
The  books are bound in a nice cover
A couple previous customers commented about the thinness of the paper
For me this was a good thing
I was concerned that  page books were not going to fit on the shelf but due to how thin the books are made I do not have this problem This is a delightful read and a great edition Highly recommended.
I bought this some time ago and finally got around to reading it
 The language is great if flowery but part way through I discovered several blank pages
 The one sent to me is the th printing of 
 I bought it over a year ago so dont think theres any return policy
 If anyone buys this check it upon receipt for blank pages
 Mine start at page  of volume one
 I can follow the story across the blank pages but it is annoying
 But other than that I love the language used in this translation.
The set is great except when I got to Volume  i found it was the wrong book  The sleeve was correct but the book was Strange Tales from the LiaoZhai Studio IV not Journey to the West IV
 I would like to replace this even though it is past the return date
 stars for the translation
  stars for the physical book quality
Since other people have expounded on the plot here is a review based on the physical book
The actual paperback novels are approximately  x 
so easy to hold in your hand and tuck into a briefcase
 The pages are a bit thin not Bible thin but they are a bit thinner than most paperback books
 One of my volumes didnt hold up well to sitting in a steamfilled bathroom
There are occasional pictures and sparse endnotes but they do not detract from the story at all
 The pictures were drawn during the Qing Dynasty  and are done in the old chinese style not some newfangled doodles
Some of the translation is a bit iffy and sentences do not necessarily always make sense but youll understand it contextually
 Some of the wording is extremely quaint such as Pig complaining that the demons failed to drink acuppa with them
 There is much more painfully British vernacular but it just adds to the goofy charm of this book
 Dont bother wringing your hands over the neverending list of characters
 Skim over them and read on
 After all there are an awful lot of demons and gods to meet on the journey and quite a few of them are fated to die via Monkeys cudgel making their characters irrelevant in the longrun
 One thing I noticed is that there is an awful lot of scatological farce for a book written in the Ming dynasty dont worry its still hilarious
Ive read a couple translations of Monkey King and while theyll all stay in my personal library this is the one I anticipate picking up again and again
 I loved this book as a child and ten years later I still do
 A mustread for fans of mythology or Chinese literature in general.
This is an excellent translation of the entire JTTW
 Sure the paper is paperthin and cheap but if you hold it up to the light you can read both sides at once saving time
 Stop whining for short money you are getting almost  pages of the finest mythology religion spirituality allegory folktale humor and monkey buttkicking awesomeness
 My favorite book in the world bar none and I can only read it in translation alas
 It might not be for everyone but Ive already read this book twice and it was sublime.
The book is very good  its a fun novel for  year old novel ..
Also keep in mind that this are  books each one of about  pages ..
The book quality is what you would expect for the price  not terrible but definitely not prime material ..
I would recommend get this if you wanna read the novel and thats it .
if you want a book you can keep and collect  probably go for a expensive one ..
Me..
I liked this one just fine
Its a great collection to have whether youre familiar with the story or not
 However the written style is a little hard to read and the translation of names is a bit too literal that its almost comical and confusing
 Nonetheless Its a great set to own.
This is the most complete and faithful translation of Journey to the West I have yet found
It is the third version of the story Ive read and unlike those other versions Adventures of Monkey KingISBN  and Monkey  A Journey to the West ABRIDGEDISBN  it contains the complete and unabridged story preserving very faitflly both the style and content of the original story
This extreme faithfulness is both a strength and a weakness
Its a strength in that you get a real feeling for the scope of the original work and you get to hear all the interesting little backstories and sidestories that make Journey to the West one of the great works of Chinese literaure
Its a weakness because these stories often seem completely irrelevant and may be quite confusing to someone who is not familiar with Chinese culture and religion
For example every time something happens in Heaven Hell or in the palace of the Tang Emperor the book includes a complete list of everyone who attended
In Heaven at least many of the names are descriptive names of stars constellations etc
and are therefore translated
In the Tang Emperors palace though youll get a list of  or  names in Chinese and only some of the names ever get stories attached to them in the book and I challenge any nonChinese speaker to remember the names when they do show up again
Theres also a lot of poetry and though the translations are good translated poetry can never equal the original
In one sequence a fisherman and a woodsman argue in verse for  or more pages of very small type frequently singing songs set to tunes few nonChinese would recognize by name
These characters are important only in that the end of their conversation sets up a conflict so the only purpose of the sequence is to provide a chance to read the poetry
Its good poetry to be sure but it really can drag a bit
You cant just automatically skip over all the poems as you might do with Tolkien either
Elements of the story are often told in verse
You can usually skim if youre not interested in a particular bit of verse but dont skip it entirely
The structure of the work is also surprisingly complex at times especially given its age
It will at times veer far from the main thrust of the story to recount the entire life history of a character and has many side stories that somehow tie back into the main plot several chapters later
You may at times find yourself wondering just why the author chose to include a particular bit of story but theres almost always a payoff waiting somewhere down the line
Another problem is that the style of the storytelling is not very concise
If someone in the story needs to recount what has happened to them youll get a second fortunately much abridged version of an earlier portion of the story written as dialog this time
You could make similar sorts of complaints about many of the early great works of English fiction or probably just about any other countrys older fiction so this is not really a strong criticism given the works great age but I often found myself wishing the author or the translator had just written he told them what had happened and left it at that
There were also many quirks of the translation that bothered me
The word memorial was used throughout instead of memorandum
It took me quite a while to figure out that was what was going on
I read all of the abridged translation that also made the same mistake throughout but still didnt figure it out until I was several chapters into this one
Will all these complaints youre probably wondering why I gave the book  stars
The fact is for all its faults and quirks Journey to the West is still one of the greatest works of fiction ever written
The Monkey King is without a doubt my favorite character in any work I have ever read or watched
The story of his journey is a brilliant parable on the jouney to enlightenment while at the same time a story of great humor and exciting action
It also provides fascinating insight into the history and traditional culture of China
If you want to get the whole story and cant read Chinese this edition is your absolute best bet
Indeed its pretty much your only bet
Some of the other translations may be a faster read but none are as satisfying.
When I was younger I saw first on TV and then later at a Kiddies Mattinee a movie Alakazam the Great
 If fascinated me and as I studied more and more mythology I realized that it must have come from a mythic source and I tried to find that source for over  years
 Last Spring I found out it was part of this book by watching a made for TV movies called The Monkey King
 Here was the story I had been searching to find in this movie named and that is when I began to look for this book
True this book has pages that are so thin that they are like tissue but they have beautiful illustrations and in these illustrations are the characters of Alakazam though he is only known as Monkey here in this Chinese Buddhist tale of pilgamage and the adventures along the way
I am used to Western Mythology Classical Norse and Celtic so this was a journey that had new meaning for me
 And like the characters of this journey it is a journey into a new and as yet source of spirituality that has much influence in the world.
Ive been a long time reading this page classic Chinese novel
 The quotes are there because if you read it as a novel youll grow tired of the repetitive elements in the large body of the story
 Think of it more as a comprehensive compendium of folklore tales centering around the central character Monkey
 The seed of the story was the actual journey of a Tang dynasty Buddhist priest from China to India and back
 This journey caught the Chinese imagination and somehow became embellished with the mythical Monkey who ultimately became much more interesting than the priest himself
 Many stories grew around a formula of Monkey protecting the priest from monsters along the journey
 The author Wu Chengen organized many of these stories into a single narrative which apparently became the authoritative record of all the Monkey folklore
This unabridged translation by W
J
F
Jenner includes a Translators Afterword which I recommend you read before not after you read the story itself
 It helps you to understand why there are so many incidents that do little to develop the story or the characters
 This edition was prepared for and printed by the Foreign Language Press of Beijing so do not expect it to meet American standards of proofreading
If you are chiefly interested in enjoying the story itself read Arthur Waleys abridged translation Monkey
 He keeps all the essential elements so that you learn the plot and get to know the characters but cuts out most of the formulaic Monkey vs
monster stories so it is paced more like a modern novel.
I bought the paperback edition several years ago
I loved the myths and read the material several times
Unfortunately the paperbacks are poorly printed and not bound well enough for multiple readings
I just received the hardbacks and make the following observations  lefthand pages are printed in Chinese while righthand pages are printed in English  pictures are on single pages with the facing pages blank  binding seems to be very well done  strong as well as supple and  there is a bookmark ribbon attached to the binding side of each volume
In summary this looks like a quality edition
The hardback is printed in  volumes while the paperback English only is done in 
I assume that the translation in the hardback is the same as in the paperback version
That was done very well and Im looking froward to rereading the adventure with quality paper in my hands thats one of the real luxuries in life I have above made several assumptions based on my prior experience with the paperback
If these assumptions prove wrong I will update this review and my rating
This is in addition to my original review I am now reading Volume  of 
There is a horrible error in that volume
There are many missing pages from Volume  in their place are many pages from Volume 
I am knocking two stars off the rating because of this
The vendor said he will send me a proper Volume  in October when his stock is replenished
I fortunately can finish reading the story because I have the paperback version from the same translator
If I receive a valid copy of Volume  I will rerate upwards and assume there was just a bad run
I also note at this time that there are many little typos wrong one of to two too many oneletter substitutions etc
I am of the opinion that the final edit of a translation should always be made by a native speaker of the to language
Im guessing that this opinion was not respected here
The errors in the paperback version if memory serves me correctly are different
This is a second update to my review I have just received a corrected copy of Vol
 from the seller
Thus I assume that good copies of this book set are available
I would caution you to check with your seller of choice that the hard copy set you order is one that does not contain the mistakes that were in my original order
At this point Im changing my product rating back to  stars.
This set exceeded my expectations
The text is clear and easy to read there are more illustrations than I expected the bindings are strong and the four books fit in their sleeve comfortably.
If you want to test the waters before jumping into the deep end may I suggest that you first watch the SciFi Channel miniseries The Lost Empire  originally aired under the title The Monkey King
While far from a faithful adaptation it is a very good introduction to the main characters and overall conceptthe character of Sanzang aka Tripitaka being replaced by an American scholar of Chinese literature
This is an incredibly lengthy story for anyone not prepared for what is inside
The basis for one of Asias most beloved childrens characters Monkey the tale is written as a series of short stories seemingly crafted with children as the target audience
Fashioned similar to western childrens adventures  Arabian Nights comes to mind each snippet of the journey comes with lots of action and shallow motivation  often falling to greed hunger hubris revenge or a simple thirst for adventure
I feel certain that these stories were kept easily accessible by many parents through the years as a means of entertaining their children
While the characters are far from anyones idea of the heroic stereotype their flaws also help to endear them
I dont want to give the impression that I am critical of this work or that I would discourage anyone from reading it only that this may not be the right choice for your first foray into Chinese literature
Many adults in Asia will unashamedly admit to having read the full volumes I once spent a couple of hours discussing favorite stories and swapping character impersonations with the CEO of a large company in China during a business dinner but western readers will likely find it disjointed and often hard to follow
Though rarely pivotal to the story and generally addressed in the generous notes the author has a great propensity for injecting phrases and concepts that the casual reader will simply not be familiar with
I often found myself running to Google in the middle of a paragraph
There is also the tendency for characters to be referred to by multiple names or titles Monkey has more than seven with no easy way to keep them straight
All things considered I tend to view Journey to the West less as entertainment than as one small facet of the cultural legacy of China.
wrapped a lot and some books damaged while shipped but got them on sale so no compliants going to give it  for it was just about what i thought would come out of a book on sale on a side note no pages damaged not a worry of mine but something worth being added to the review
Best adventure stories ever.
Cant say enough about how much I love Sun Wukong
He has got to be the greatest mentor of them all.
Rarely do I come across books that captivate me
 They are so rare in fact I remember their titles well
 Carlos Castendas books for example and his stories about don Juan
 Journey to the West falls into this category
 Each time I resume reading it I catch myself with a smile on my face yes I am enjoying the story
 And I hate to put it down when life calls me to duty
 I already know I am going to hate it when I come to the last sentence of the last volume in this set
 Perhaps fate will spare me and I will die before I reach the last sentence of the last volume at least I can say I died happy  Now it may be true that other translations of this story are better and I am starting to mull over that notion still I for one willl not tell you this particular translation is bad no no no that will never be my pronouncement
 I encourage any doubters who may be thinking about it  yes buy the set and enjoy it
 You will not be sorry.
Journey to the West is indeed a great epic and the prose is actually quite good
Its concise and easy to follow
Im not sure about how accurate the translation is I cant read Mandarin
However the one thing that really makes me angry is the numerous silly spelling errors throughout the book
Its as if no one bothered to edit it there are one or two errors per chapter
There is even a spelling error in the summary at the back of the book they used isa instead of is a
The paper and print quality is below average
The book is damaged and creased easily
Although the story is great and the translation is good the book is presented in a haphazard manner.
This was advertised as the entire set all four volumes but I only received volume  in the mail
Falsely advertised.
I liked the stories in this book
It is an adventure from a log time ago that takes place in Asia
A movie was made of the series but there is a lot to this and the movie really only had one of the many adventures in it
My son liked it as well.
Our family wants to learn about Chinese legends
Great books
Quick ship good packaging wonderful  volumes of the Journey.The softbacks were overly tightened in being bound so that it is difficult to read the last word or twobut  its part of the journey so enjoy.
I know nothing of Chinese history much less Buddhism but I thoughly enjoyed this series
Knowing something of the Monkey King the mind and a bit of background about this book helped me to enjoy even more when I was taken on an adventure ride I will not soon forget
This has got to be the longest comic book ever written  it is that entertaining
Do not buy the abridged versions of the Monkey King as you will not get the full effect of what I beleive was intended which is to discribe lifes sacrifice and rewards.
Exactly what I wanted
Box set in amazing package and great price Perfect gift
I purchased this for my son for his birthday and I havent seen his face since without one of the volumes in front of it
 He absolutely loves it
 I tried unsuccessfully to find this set at other booksellers and as always when I need something Amazon came through
 Thank you for excellent service and availability
 I look forward to many more purchases in the future.
The only thing I didnt like is the font printed is too small.
Package arrived earlier very than forecasted
Everything fine according with promised
Very satisfied.
I was extremely satisfied
All of the books are in like new condition and have not been used any if at all..
stars
awesome this was for my daughter very good condition came right on time very nice collectionshe is very happy with this item will buy again  nice experience everything was great.
This is volume  of  only
Not whole set.
One of the great Chinese Classics
Dont miss it
Youll love Monkey
Now you can read it in English translation
 This is a classic novel and one of the five best written novels
I have read the series at least three times
 Very fun
 Very addictive series
 This series gives you a very fun look into ancient Chinese culture and mindset.
The novel is obviously great
But this exact translation is a little outdated
You would have a much better read with the newer Alex Yu translations
Also you lose a few stars for labeling this product as a novel in  volumes and not volume  of 
Nowhere on the order page did it make it clear and obvious I was buying jut the th volume
I really thought I had god a great deal on the complete texts until the package arrived and it was just one book
Try harder guys.
While there are definitely some interesting stories interspersed throughout the major takeaway I had from this book was how LONG and BORING the adventure was
Once the main characters are established they have encounter after encounter with trouble which inevitably goes as follows  Monster sees Tang priest  Monster kidnaps Tang priest  Monkey saves the day It is in fact so formulaic that after having finished just the first out of four book there is nothing truly surprising anymore
I get that the whole journey is supposed to be epic and that the true length of their adventure must be shown but just because the Priest and his disciples are tired from the journey doesnt mean we have to be Yes there is character development and exciting battles along the way but do you need  pages for it Absolutely Not For all those looking to get into the story I strongly suggest a more condensed version.
If you are interested in Buddhism you will enjoy this book
 It helps to already know something about the religion
 As a bonus the box has a nifty color picture of the Tang monk and the book covers have nice color pictures of Monkey Pig and Friar Sand
The adventures are a bit repetitious but a hootMonkey is the ultimate fearless dealmaker ready to fight on his own or call in favors to get the job done.
Editorial Note I realize it sounds incredibly pretentious to speak on the translation given that I cant read the original Chinese
As a disclaimer let me say that the most important aspects of translation for me are interest and readability
I couldnt care less about the accuracy or tone of the original work etc.
Perhaps I want something different from a translation than most
While many scholars want the reader to see the flavor of the Chinese original I want the work to stand on its own in my language
I dont want to have to learn Chinese in order to appreciate the work
With these thoughts in mind I am disappointed in Jenners translation of Journey to the West
I am no scholar
While I have read a few works here and there the reading was solely for my amusement
To be sure some of the works of ancient Chinese literature have truly moved me I have read Three Kingdoms four times straight through and have perused it uncountably often
I challenge any reader to find a better adventure tale than Shapiros retelling of Outlaws of the Marsh and The Scholars has an immediacy even in todays world
However while the saga of the Monkey King can be at times engaging I often lose focus sifting through the religious imagery and boring poetry yes I suppose it is very good but most of these poems sound the same so that in the end every poetic retelling of a battle or a landscape might as well be the first
I think that the elements of a TREMENDOUS story are present indeed Monkey is a household name among Asian children even today but few children or adults can suffer through the tedium of passages such as Most benevelont and merciful Boddhisattva or Enlightened Teacher of the Way and Most Compassionate Buddha over and over
Call me sacreligious but this is too much
I wish that Jenners work more resembled Shapiros where poetry is often translated as prose or deleted altogether so as NOT to give away the plot of an entire chapter
Five stars to the work one to the translation for an average of three altogether.
I have yet to actually sit down and read these books but I wanted to review the quality of the item
The box tore easily The pages are super thin to point you can see through them there was glue on the binding and covers of all  books that was easily scratched off with my nail and the pages of one book were cut wrong a section was too short and the top of them were connected and had to be torn apart
Not worth the money from quality alone
Reading some other reviews I learned the translation is in accurate or sloppy.
This item I purchased for my oldest son
I taught him to like books so whenever possible I get him books
 This is the type of book he is in to these days
 Gathering knowledge in the way of reading books these days is such a joy that I strongly suggest this item to anyone that loves books as much as my son and I do.
This rating has strictly to do with the thin paper used to create the book and not the actual content of the book
 I had issues with the very thin paper the book was printed on
 So thin that the opposite side of the page bled through to the page I was reading and made it appear blurry which gave me a near instant headache so I was unable to proceed
 I really wanted to read this book based on a friends recommendation and all the positive reviews it got here but the blurriness made it impossible 
 Will try again from a different publisher.
The book was good but I thought that the spirit and demon stories are too much the same over and over
 Especially when the author translate the  phrase the two fought for so many rounds and neither seem to emerge to a victory
every time Monkey King fights the demons
 Believe me it gets old
And Tang priest is made out to be so wimpy crying all of the times hes caught by the demons
 I know hes supposed to be a mortal man but common  crying like a baby whenever hes caught Another thing why hasnt the Tang priest trust Monkey Kings judgement on knowing when they meet spirits and demons  They have been traveling together for like ten years or so
I had to skip a lot because got tired of reading the same type of monsters capturing them and what Monkey King has to go thru to save them.
awsome perfect for a gift
This is the second complete English translation of A Journey to the West the first being Yus
 Jenners version makes compelling reading and I found it very difficult to put the book down
 The translation is sprightly and idiomatic and the extensive passages in verse are attractively rendered
The only demerits are the lack of footnotes to explain some of the references to individuals and doctrines for which one needs Yus version and the relatively poor standard of printing and typography better proofreading would have helped  However I cannot say that these shortcomings impaired my enjoyment of these volumes and I would strongly recommend them to anyone in search of a readable version of this engrossing epic.
poor translating  the story is great but poor choice of wording make it difficult to read.
There are at present two complete versions of the long Chinese comic novel Journey to the West
 One of them the more recent is published by Anthony Yu at Chicago University Press
 The other an older version made by W
J
F
Brenner for the Foreign Language Press is made over five decades ago but is as yet still not completely superseded
Looking through the translations its obvious that both are worthy undertakings by two enthusiatic contemporary Sinologists
 Anthony Yu though not a native English speaker is professor of East Asian studies at the Chicago University an expert in his field and an ethnic Chinese
 Brenner is a longtime Sino translator who has rendered his fair share of Chinese classics into English
 So how did these two translations fare compared with each other Brenner is a nononsensical and very sensible translator of the Wu Chengens book
 While he doesnt take great liberties with the text when required he demonstrates lots of felicities in reframing Chinese ideas and philosophies into English
Take the beginning for instance a difficult passage which involves understanding of Chinese arithmetics and metaphysics
 Here is Brenners version In the arithmetic of the universe  years make one cycle
Each cycle can be divided into twelve phases I II III IV V VI VII
VIII IX X XI and XII the twelve branches
Each phase lasts  years
Now within a single day the positive begins at the time I at II the cock crows at III it is not quite light at IV the sun rises V is after breakfast and at VI one does business
VII is when the sun reaches noon at VIII it is slipping towards the west IX is late afternoon the sun sets at X XI is dusk and at XII people settle down for the night
This is elegant as is readable and comprehensible to an English audience
 Although Brenner forgoes the nittygritties of exact transliteration he did not excise anything of note and got the gist of the passage right
 One could imagine this is how the author would have composed in English
Brenners translation is consistently fine and accurate
 His language is on the whole simple and easily understood as long you have a high school degree
 Where Brenner is more limited as compared to Arthur Waleys classic abridged Monkey is in recreating the full range of tones and satiric emotions of the original
 Journey to the West is a satirical highspirited adventure story Brenner is idiomatic and readable but he can occasionally sacrifice some of the originals comic mischievousness
 Here Waley is incomparable though he may sound a little arch one has no doubt Waley is at one with Wu Chengens spirit
 Brenner on the other hand can at times sound a little too matteroffactly
 There are moments where you will chuckle in delight reading Waley but might not do so with Brenner
Now to Anthony Yus version
 Made in the s it too is a highly commendable piece of work
 The first thing one notices about it is its extreme faithfulness to the text  even more so than Brenners
 At times it even strikes one as being slavish
 One must praise his version for being so strictly straightforward though at times this literalmindedness makes some word choices incomprehensible to English readers
 Take his constant rendition of Wood Mother for instance a term which has no meaning whatsoever in English or eating rice for taking a meal
 This is a version especially good if you know your Chinese and would like a crib to read the original with
 While maybe not as idiomatic as Brenner Yu is even more academic and scholarly in that he attempts to translate every character of the language
 Faithfulness to the letter of the text takes foremost priority sometimes over readibility
The success rate is varying but the translation is on the whole an admirable one
Comparing the two both Yu and Brenner can be recommended
 Yu would be first choice if fidelity to the text is your priority
 If you prefer your English to be more idiomatic and the story to flow better Brenner should be considered
 The two run pretty close and neither is yards ahead of the other
 But Waleys translation is still a marvellous read and even if it is highly abridged it should under no circumstances be forgotten.
Nice story
Very entertaining
Full of important allegory
For example if you find yourself in the company of a pig a monkey and a horse do you really think you can stay out of trouble Or will the pig the horse and the monkey redeem themselves by saving your bacon And can you really get where you are going without them Or should you choose a different destination and leave the pig the monkey and the horse where you found them You can see that it gets really interesting
We all go through life with this barnyard coterie of associates and what we think of them and how well we collaborate is of the utmost importance so that is what I am thinking as I reflect on this very interesting not to mention fun book.
I finally finished Journey to the West the other day
At over  pages across four volumes its quite a journey in and of itself
I will examine plot characters and polish before assigning a grade
 This is a review of the novel as a whole
I might do something more specific at a later date
 PLOT  The novel itself is basically two stories
First is the Rise and Fall of the Monkey King and the second is Xuanzangs journey to fetch scriptures from Thunder Monastery
 The Rise and Fall of Monkey is like a Protagonists Journey to Villain
It starts off with Stone Monkey becoming the Handsome Monkey King and going on adventures to protect his kingdom from threats up to and including deathbyoldage
Then he gets so full of himself he attacks gods and rebels against heaven
In the end this villain is defeated
 The plot is quick fast paced and constantly escalates
The method by which Monkey becomes so powerful makes sense
The series of events that lead to him trapped under Five Elements Mountain is driven by character decisions
It can stand alone as a complete story
Naturally Monkey fans want to see him get out from under that rock but it can stand alone
 The rest of the novel is Xuanzangs journey to fetch scriptures
It has an interesting start
Theres this Dantes Inferno thing as part of the set up and theres also how Xuanzang gets involved in the quest and then how he recruits his three disciples
Then its basically filler until they reach Thunder Monastery
 The Pilgrims encounter demons that want to eatseduce Xuanzang and Monkey has to rescue him
Usually he has to seek help from other deities instead of simply smashing everything in his path
Theres occasional variations like helping a kingdom from an unrelated demon scheme problems with humans or a Broken Bridge
 I like the ending
Its a good ending with closure and such
 CHARACTERS  Because there is No Antagonist the only developed main characters here are the pilgrims themselves
 Xuanzang is basically a walking plot device because he takes no action other than starting the journey and placing the headband on Monkeys head
Monkey could jump back and forth between Thunder Monastery and Tang capital twenty times with ease but Xuanzang is mortal and cannot ride on clouds so he has to go the long and hard way
He gets captured to involve the Pilgrims in the affairs of demons along the way and insists on helping everyone even if theyre a demon in disguise thus providing the excuse to delay the Journey
 If the other three characters in your cast are criminal demons then its necessary to have somebody like this but he could stand to be more like a true Good Shepherd and less like a jerkass
 Monkey is like a Trope Maker or something for general shonen anime heroes hes rude arrogant and defeats enemies by beating them senseless with his superior martial arts but he is also driven by a kind heart that wants to protect his subjects
In addition he is an old and cunning trickster
Many of his victories rely on sneaking around gathering Intel and then devising a strategy to overcome his opponents advantages
He also knows more about Buddhist teachings than his own master who was raised a Buddhist monk
 Pig is basically a sidekick type character
He makes wisecracks helps the hero in small ways and gets captured occasionally
 There isnt much to say about Friar Sand or the dragon princehorse for that matter
 POLISH  When youre translating over  pages of Chinese into English theres bound to be some typos
I only found a couple which is admirable on the part of the translator
 Trickster Eric Novels gives Journey to the West a B
For any translated work reader should own  for parallel reading and this one is a direct translation
The author uses splitcharacter method to create  main characters Master Monkey Pig and Sandy
that actually one person that holds all these character on a struggling road for good
Master fears Monkey dares Pig lusts Sandy dumb of course each one holds more related natures not to mention I hate many critics state that Sandy is not fully developed thats exactly such person that we may find him at our work place and in government office too
And another things a reader may find out that those road blocks demons and monsters are actually closely related to many gods sages and even Buddhas their family servants or weaponary or item which their belongings that cause all the troubles for the  and the common people on earth
True Wu Kong wants to be great he is great San Zang wants to get all wisdom scroll for his nation people even the gods support them but who are truly blocking them to do so This is not only satire to religion and government it reaches deeper and much farther than To the West
It is a journey or reflection that author carries us to experience and each reflection after beating away a demon and at last even Buddha calls a storm to sink some of their scrolls
Just look around company society government or even religious institute or any institute as long as one who recognizes himself in it and strives for good then he may obtain the experience and nature of the  main characters and he would also discover all the gods and demons jade emperor Guan Yi White Bone Fairy...
Welcome the Journey to the West its better than Disney world coz this mythical world is  real 
Journey to the West is probably the most wellknown tale amongst Chinese folk the world over
 It is a story that has been adapted in the form of operas television series cartoons and movies many times over
 To be able to read a complete and unabridged version of this epic is a joy indeed
 My only regret is that as a Westerneducated Chinese I am not able to read this masterpiece in its original language
 Although the translator does a very good job at translating the book I am sure many nuances and subtleties of the Chinese language have been lost in the translation
The story is a simple one
 Set during the early Tang dynasty the peak of Chinese civilisation a holy Buddhist monk has to travel from China to India to collect the true Mahayana Buddhist scriptures from the Lord Buddha himself in order to bring enlightenment to his fellow country men
 The journey is a long and ardous one not least because numerous demons lie waiting in ambush for a chance to capture and eat the monk as his holy body will confer immortality on whoever eats it
 Thus the Goddess of Compassion assembles a strange group of bodyguards for the monk the proud and mischievous Monkey the lustful and greedy Pig the loyal and steadfast Friar Sand and a Dragon Prince transformed into a horse
 Their various adventures are so full of humor and wacky hijinks that I cannot help myself from laughing out from time to time
 Monkey is the ultimate Chinese version of the universal tricksterhero
 Do yourself a favor and pick up this book
 You will not regret it for a moment.
I should point out that I am just a product of the American public education system who only knows english
I read this in my free time and knew little to to nothing of Chinese history
Somethings I feel are definately lost in translation here
I understand that much of the Poetry is layed out in beautiful rhymes and even set to music in Mandarin or whatever dialect came first but to read these parts translated quite so literaly into english is as painful as it is reduntant
I tried to skip some of it but once in a while there is one tiny detail that you have to catch in the poetry explanations that are integral to the overal story of a given chapter
In that respect we pay a culture penalty for reading this in english no matter how skillfully this book was translated
The origion chapters for the main characters where a thrill ride and every bit worth the cost of the book
After you have established the characters and their origion stories and they set off on their well.
Journey to the West some of the monster stories start to follow simular patterns
The middle to end parts of this book may have made for an entertaining tv series
Every chapter there was always some kind of monster trying to eat the Tang Priest guy that Monkey and company where escourting
If it wasnt scary monster animaldemon spirits trying to eat the Monk to gain immortality it was some female monsteranimaldemon spirit trying to have sex with the Tang priest to gain immortality because he was an th generation reincarnated virgin saint or something
These stories are intermitten with other chapters that had to do with them taking a detour or having to deal with someone from Monkeys past or some monsters trying to mess with our heros for whatever reason
There are alot of crossover cameos from other numerous Chinese and Indian storys and mythologies
To that end it has sort of a Shrek  vibe to it
This book is an epic every bit as worthy if not more so than the likes of the Illiad or The Lord of the Rings
This also reads like a comic book that hasnt been fully illistrated yet
Nobody tell Frank Miller
The battle scenes go on for several pages at times
If thats your thing there you go
If you dont mind skimming through a dab of gibberish here or there to get to a great story this book is for you
Fair warning you may not get through it in one sitting It did run over  pages.
This is a great Chinese classic  I think that the translation is not too bad given its history and it would be fun to read aloud
 I like how the books are divided and the illustrations from the Qing dynasty are also fascinating
 As for the content I think it is probably widely known among people who study Chinese culture
 The most lovable character is obviously Monkey who will stop at nothing to protect his feeble Buddhist master the Tang priest Sanzang
 Zhu the pig is also interesting as an incessantly loathsome character who specializes in overeating and overindulging in just about everything
 The only character I think could have been more developed was Friar Sand.

 The most predictable one was Quan Yin who always ends up saving Monkey for the first two books
 Some great moments were the manfruit the false Western Heaven and of course Monkeys bad behavior in the first  chapters of the book
 Its a great read for any age.
Ive always loved books particularly the kind that create a new and different world and draw you into it
It seems I was pretty serious about my fantasy reading as evidenced by an inscription to my children in the back of The Fellowship of The Ring mass market paperback edition circa 
I wrote the inscription with a ballpoint pen when I was 
My daughter showed it to me when she was  or so
It said something to the effect that I love this book so much that my only wish is to pass it on to my kids so that they can feel what I did when I first read it
Apparently I did and apparently they did
I still feel that way about The Lord of The Rings but I read Journey To The West a couple of years ago and it made me feel the same way except magnified
I was  when I first read it
It was like Tolkien plus all the L
Frank Baum Oz books plus the Arabian Nights all the Greek myths Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams all rolled into one
This book is over  pages so it took some discipline to get through
But as you go you savor each moment each line
When I turned the final page I was seriously tempted to start again at the beginning
Seriously its that good
It is that good despite being very far out of context for most people like me
What I mean is Im about as Western as you can get or at least my parents intended me to be so
My understanding is that Chinese kids absorb the Monkey King story by osmosis they drink it like mothers milk from they day they are born ...
kind of like Big Bird or Elmo in the west
But thats not at all a fair comparison
Big Bird and Elmo fall in the category of pop culture
This same category is fair game for any number of PhD theses in any number of fields of learning
Do you reckon anyone will know who Elmo is  years from now Neither do I
But we still know Monkey today and I bet we will still know him  years from now if there is anyone around to know anything
It is possible that Journey to the West is the most widely read or known text in the history of humanity
Thats a bizarre thought to those of us brought up in the isolated shelter of JudeoChristian mythology
Im sure it is less analyzed than the Christian bible but then it doesnt exactly beg for analysis its obviously a very long fable indicating very little in the way of how to live ones life whether or not to eat bacon with tea on a Tuesday morning or anything else relevant to modern life
Its not about textbook ethics nor is it about everyday morality
Its not about how to please God or your fellow man woman if you are one to quote Colin Hay
Its about fantasy
Its about delight in the sheer variety of the world around
If I were a book I would want to be about that
All that is left is for me to suggest that you read Monkey King
Its a project and you need to get in the right frame of mind
Youre going to need some fortitude to read it all but its worth it
It really is worth it
What follows is my somewhat lame attempt to summarize a book which probably shouldnt be summarized
Please ignore it I wrote it in a fit of passion  years ago
Sun Wukong is the Handsome Monkey King Great Sage Equaling Heaven
This book is about Sun Wukong the Monkey
The novel is composed of  chapters each told as a story such as an oral storyteller might relate
Each chapter ends with a sort of cliffhanger and a directive to read on if you want to know what happens next
In chapter  Monkey is born hatched  and asserts himself as a force to be reckoned with
Hes fairly happy eating exotic fruits and being king of the mountain but eventually the idea of death occurs to him and he gets quite naturally upset
One of his monkey friends suggests to him that there are  kinds of beings who are free from the cycle of death and rebirth Buddhas Immortals and Sages
The Immortals are enlightened ones of the Taoist faith and Sages refers to Confucianism
The Handsome Monkey King decides to set out on a journey to gain immortality
Eventually after about  years have passed he runs into a Taoist Immortal who imparts the secrets of everlasting life and great travel powers to him
Having acquired great cosmic powers Monkey proceeds to use them
He causes no end of distress to the kings of Hell in Chapter  and soon comes to the attention of Heaven i.e
the Powers That Be
Heaven attempts to placate Monkeys insatiable lust for power and recognition with a fake job and title
Monkey can be fooled but only for so long and in the end he causes chaos in Heaven which is a bad thing
The Jade Emperor of Heaven calls out all the armies of demons heavenly generals and warriors you name it
Time after time they try to take Monkey into custody and fail until finally the Buddha himself steps in and traps Monkey
Handsome Monkey King is imprisoned under a mountain for some  years
By now were up to chapter  in which the Bodhisattva Guanyin sets out on a journey to appoint a pure hearted priest to go west and bring back the scrolls of wisdom from the Buddhas Western Paradise
On the way Guanyin flags a couple of demons to help the priest on his journey
In chapters  through  we learn about Sanzang the Tang Priest who is destined to recover the scriptures from the West a million miles away or so it seems
Sanzang is a rather weak fellow a mere mortal with no special powers of any kind
His strength is the pureness of his heart and his faith in his mission
The Journey to the West is Sanzangs voyage to recover the scrolls and it really begins in chapter 
He does not have an easy time of it being almost constantly beset by tigers monsters and demons not to mention deep dark forests and formidable mountain ranges
However the Tang Priest quickly gets help in the form of a dragon transformed into a horse a flesh eating demon who works as a bodyguard and gopher and a gluttonous moronic pigdemon who serves nicely as a luggage carrier
But most importantly he acquires Monkey who is freed from his imprisonment under the mountain on the condition that he helps the Tang Priest and cultivates his behavior learning to be a good Buddhist monk
Imagine Monkey with a shaved head
Once the cast is assembled the journey begins in earnest
Monkey the Idiot Pig Sandy and the dragon horse accompany Sanzang through  miles of dangerous terrain beset by evil spirits and demons at every turn
By this time were done with chapter   pages into the novel and weve closed the back cover of Volume 
In the other hand we hold Volume  almost drooling with anticipation
Throughout the next  chapters the action is pretty much nonstop
There are lots of bad guys and Monkey gets lots of chances to show off his incredible magical powers his sheer brute force and his amazing mental capacity
His conversations and arguments with The Tang Priest and The Idiot are always amusing and sometimes hilarious
His martial prowess wielding the AsYouWill Iron Cudgel is unparalleled
Sometimes even Monkey gets in over his head and has to call in an air strike in the form of Heavenly forces or various Gods Constellations or other muscle
I wont give away the ending but suffice it to say its a happy one after  pages
As to the quality of the translation I have nothing to add
It was more than readable to me it was a delight poetry and all
As to the quality of the editing its not perfect
On the other hand the flaws dont detract from the experience at all
As to the quality of the printing keep in mind that this is published by Foreign Language Press of Beijing
In some ways FLP doesnt live up to American standards of production quality but in others it excels them
The paper is necessarily thin but the books are tightly bound
These are not massmarket paperbacks
One does not feel that the books will fall apart on a second reading and there is very little danger of breaking the spine
Also Journey to the West is nicely illustrated with Qing Dynasty pictures
The quality of the reproductions is not the highest but lets not bite the hand that feeds us
My box of Journey to the West was a bit scuffed and dinged and dented
Same with the other titles I have purchased from FLP through Amazon
I imagine this is FLPs fault
Im not entirely happy about it but for a book this great I can live with a couple of small physical flaws especially at this price
Im just happy I got my grubby little monkey paws on it.
JOURNEY TO THE WEST IS A CELEBRATED CLASSIC WRITTEN ABOUT FIVE CENTURIES AGO BY WU CHENGEN AKA MASTER OF SHEYANG ABOUT THE JOURNEY TO THE WEST TO FETCH THE SUTRA BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS a story of every persons purpose in life to live a righteous life go on the road he or she must go until he or she reaches the Western Paradise
This person represented by a team of the Tang Priest and his four disciples has personalities like each of them
We may not know it but we have an ounce of cleverness and bravery and strength in each and every one of us like Monkey King and are we not as stupid lazy and lascivious as Pig Like Frair Sand we can be steadfast to our beliefs what is right and can tell what is man and what is demon what is right and what is wrong The horse is repentant of his crime and accepted his converted life as a horse are we  not like that too The Tang Priest represents everything that is pure and right but is a gullible person
The demons they met on their way represent different sins and temptations to fight them is a battle within oneself fighting for what is right and against what is wrong
At last when all battles against evil are won they are pure and righteous and changed over the course of the journey worthy to meet Buddha get the Sutras and become Buddhas themselves
This simple story is lesser known as a religious story but is still highly recommended by me because of its exciting plot great charactersa reflection of Chinese feudalism and society of the time Wu Chengen lived teachings of Buddhism and knowing a thing or two about Chinese culture all packaged in one
A true classic
Journey to the West translated by W J F Jenner is a little too good a translation
The Chinese love their bureaucracy
Numbers are very important and interesting to them as are titles and position
Translating all the boring bits does not make for a good read but it does make for an excellent insight into Chinese culture not on a mythological level the rest of the novel does a great job of that but on the day to day level and how government affects their day to day life
To that end its a very good translation
A bit boring at times if youre not one for too much detail that bears little relevance to the plot
Characters are named with grand titles but never appear again while minor characters will receive fully fleshed out back stories that seem tangential to the original story but soon tie neatly in
A very good set of books
Interesting boring at times but as pure as it can be to the source material without learning one of the most difficult languages in the world
Also this is the story that inspired Monkey Magic and Dragon Ball
If youre fan of either its a good read just out of curiosity.
Back in the s there was a TV show made in Hong Kong and dubbed into English by the BBC
It was called Monkey and the premise was that three spirits had been banished to Earth to regain entry to Heaven they had to take sacred writings to the West travelling with a priest
Now I loved this programme for several reasons 
the stories were wonderful 
it had great action sequences 
the acting was hilarious 
it had a funky seventies discocheese soundtrack
So little did I suspect that the story was an ancient tale by Chengen Wu  it took a friend from Japan to point it out
Reliving my wasted youth  I ordered instantly from Amazon and have not been disappointed  these stories are wonderful and perfectly mixed my childhood afternoon TV sessions after school with my  year old mind and spirituality
I still love Monkey Pigsy and Sandy  and I suspect you will too
I grew up with these stories and just wanted to read them and put them all together
 It was great to find it and now putting all the stories together is a wonderfull thing
 I have a greater understand of the tail now.
I have already read it several times and I think I will read it again some time
Its a fun novel besides folklore collections and ancient Chinese fiction presenting a real world through imaginary stories
You will encounter demons sometimes godlike ones gods sometimes common peoplelike ones and common people..
I dont know about others but I found myself in this book sometimes I am the priest sometimes I am the pig and sometimes I am the monkey..
PS Its one of the so called  Chinese ancient classics other  are A Dream of Red Mansions Outlaws of the Marsh and Three Kingdoms
It was a gift to someone else
Though Journey to the West is immeasurably important in the history of fiction I find it hard to recommend it in its entirety
Sure the story itself is a classic but it for the most part is also incredibly dull repetitive and downright confusing as an actual novel
For instance the story begins with a longwinded explanation of how the Kalpa system works
Fine thats pretty interesting
This serves as a transition into the actual story which begins like so There was once a magic stone on the top of this mountain which was thirtysix feet five inches high and twentyfour feet round
It was thirtysix feet five inches high to correspond with the  degrees of the heavens and twentyfour feet round to match the twentyfour divisions of the solar calendar
On top of it were nine apertures and eight holes for the Nine Palaces and the Eight Trigrams
Okay we get it
There was a rock on a mountain
Moving on..
There were no trees around it to give shade but magic fungus and orchids clung to its sides
Ever since Creation began it had been receiving the truth of Heaven the beauty of Earth the essence of the Sun and the splendour of the Moon and as it had been influenced by them for so long it had miraculous powers
It developed a magic womb which burst open one day to produce a stone egg about the size of a ball
When the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey
Wait what How Back it up a second Hey When the stone monkey had learned to crawl and walk he bowed to each of the four quarters
As his eyes moved two beams of golden light shot towards the Pole Star palace
Huh Why I assumed that the monkeys origin was in line with the mythical creator Pan Gus given the similarities but after page one its never acknowledged
We never learn why the rock changes into a monkey of anything in the universe it couldve been
And the light thing No hint of reason is given it just happens
There are plenty of moments like this
Bizarre mystical mumbo jumbo thats never explained
Ive asked fans and scholars alike about this scene and to this day there is no explanation of what the hell its supposed to mean
Oh and the poetry..
ugh
Every few paragraphs the story suddenly grinds to a halt so that the narrator can expound an awkwardly translated poem
Usually these serve to replace the conventional act of conveniently describing something
Usually this means pointing out every intricate detail of a characters outfit or a plot of land for no real reason
Maybe it sounds wonderful in its original Chinese but the translations Ive read are all cringeworthy
Heres an example also from the first few pages
This one describes a feast Golden pills and pearl pellets Bursting red and plump yellow
The golden pills and pearl pellets were winter cherries beautiful and sweet The bursting red and plump yellow were ripe plums tasty and sharp
Fresh sweetfleshed longans with thin skins
Fiery lichees with tiny stones in a red sack
Branch after branch of crabapples Yellowskinned loquats with their leaves on
Rabbithead pears and chickenheart jujubes To quench your thirst remove your cares and sober you up
Fragrant peaches and tender apricots As sweet and luscious as jade wine
This goes on for a page and a half
I think that just about explains it
 That said this novel has a major upside the actual story of the first seven chapters
Though its largely considered a prologue by purists most of whom just Wikipedia summaries of chapter eight and up the wild adventure of Sun Wukong the monkey king which Ill call Part One for conveniences sake is the only part anyone really cares about
Poetry and lackluster prose aside Part One is one big swashbuckling adventure following Wukongs rise to power and war against Heaven
Its colorful epic and the only section that follows a consistant plot
It also contains some of the most famous moments in Chinese fiction including Wukongs training the basis for Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back the Buddhas Palm scene and one incredible chase sequence that really knocked me off my feet
When Part One wraps up though everything goes downhill
 The actual journey westward sees a main character switch and a change in format
The alleged meatandpotatoes of the novel follows a monk named Xuanzang as he and his four desciples including Wukong as they travel to India to acquire a set of scriptures
This section takes from Chapter  to  and between those points there is no concept of coherence or character development
Its entirely episodic and formulaic to a point where you can skip  of it and nothing will have moved forward
Most of these episodes consist of Xuanzang being kidnapped by a monsteroftheweek and Wukong saving him while their comrades contribute little to nothing at all
It gets old fast and the overly direct translations dont help at all
 There is very little reason to keep reading after Part One
Some of the demons during the main quest are fun I very much like the main party even if none of them develop at all during the course of the story but there isnt much to go on once Sun Wukong steps out of the limelight in Chapter 
Instead I recommend a few alternatives
 The kids TV series that aired on the BBC in the s called Monkey
Its pure hyperactive campy fun
 The Chinese animated film Havoc in Heaven is a beautiful rendering of Part One only
 Arthur Waleys famous abridged version also called Monkey cuts out most of the repitition and all of the poetry
Its snappy whimsical and much better paced than the massive original.
While the story is long and can get repetitive at times it is a classic
 If you wish to undersatnd the culture of China in any way you must be familiar with this story
 Go Monkey
One of the best books Ive ever read
I got hooked to the book the monment I read the first  pages.
I only received the first Volume from the thirdparty seller.
IF you like mythic kung fu movies you will be thrilled with this book
 Its  times more baddazzz than any related movie or cartoon you could hope to see
I would compare it to the Oz books mixed with the Orlando epics.
Am looking forward to read it
E.Lauterbach
Bought for my son he loves the books
although a great book somewhat marred by a less than perfect translation although lets give credit where credit is due i would not have liked to edit this book  this book reads somewhat like water
 about two thousand pages of the narrative deals with the journey of Priest Monkey Pig and Friar Sand as they travel westward in search of the scriptures of the Greater Vehicle  the other three hundred pages deals with the birth of the Monkey King and his rebellion in heaven at the start of the book and the end where they finally reach the Thunder Monastary on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven a.k.a
Tibet
pretty much the rest of the book deals with the trials and tribulations that these four monks only three of which are fully developed characters poor Friar Sand is left as the fifth wheel most of the time go through in trying to fetch these scriptures for the enlightenment of all humanity
 the priest is a real dingdong hes constantly getting himself into all sorts of trouble and he never heeds the Monkey Kings advice about anything so the Priest is always falling into the jaws of some new monster on virtually every chapter
 the Pig is no better as he would sooner run into trouble or create trouble for everyone else for the sake of either his pride or his stomach
 the Monkey King is the real hero of this book as he is constantly rescuing everyone from some sort of demon or tempting succubus around practically every corner
 and what of Friar Sand 


well he is just kind of there to guide the Priests horse
this book is definitely worth a read though i thoroughly enjoyed it despite its short comings
 the incessant poetry gets kind of annoying though most of it is relevant to the plot so you cant really skip too much of it
 i give it four stars.
i love this book
when i am reading the book i place it in my backpocket to be able to pickup and read whenver i have time
i cant seem to put this book down.
I got the product Journey to the West  volume boxed set fairly quickly but the books were a little scuffed up with the corner of one of the four volumes bent up to a couple pages
 Being only a paperback though this doesnt bother me much as they would have been in this condition or worse after Ive finished it
  Otherwise good service I contacted the seller in advance to confirm that the version of this book was the one I was looking for since there are many retellings of Journey to the West and I got a prompt reply.
Even people who dont have a scholarly or hobby interest in Chinese culture will enjoy this amazingly sassy VERY VERY long epic about a quest to get instructions from the buddha
 Magic animals lots of martial arts poetic evocations of scenery
 Its really a lot of fun
 But you have to be a person who can commit to a very long story
 This book comes in four volumes.
Imagine The Lord of the Rings doubling its length complexity of plots the number of characters monsters spirits and other beings of all kinds  then you get the idea of just what a monumental book this is
 Its like an encyclopedia written in the form of a novel  Its also the most famous fanatasy fiction in the Chinesespeaking world
 Now thats a big deal
The Buddhist monks mission is to walk all the way from the Chinese capital to India a distance of at least  miles
 By contrast the distance between Hobbiton and Mordor is only about  miles
 While the monks goal is to take back Buddhist books from the West i.e
India Frodos task is to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom of Mordor i.e
in the East
The Monk is to bring back something of great importance the Hobbit to destroy it
 The Monk is a man of great wisdom with an absolutely pure heart but powerless and helpless in the face of monsters
 He commands the services of his pupil the Monkey King who has limitless supernatural powers
 Hobbits strength lies also in his purity of heart which however fails only at the very end
 Otherwise he is just as powerless as the Monk
 Gandalf is the man of great wisdom and a tremendous wizard who assists Frodo
 The Journey to the West is permeated throughout with Buddhist overtones and undertones  like blood in the human body they are everywhere
 Tolkiens book is pagan of course but the distinction between good and evil is no less sharp
 All characters return home heroes
Those whove read both books or at least seen the films adapted from them will appreciate the complexity of the Chinese imaginative mind
 Nothing Tolkien wrote can compare
 Curiously little is known about this author other than the great fame of his book.
Its a true classic and I am enjoying it very much.
very fast servicebooks in optimal condition glad to have chosen amazon the book is very interesting i chose it because im interested in china and im learning chinese and i like to read about places ive been in china.
Daily Deals is cool when you buy from them First time dealing with Daily Deals I am very happy with how they communicate with you
good
A Chinese born friend told me about this story and how it is the basis for the TV series Monkey
The book compared to the TV show is a superior experience.
This was purchased for my son for Christmas when I could not find it at the library
 He loved it and was happy to find that it came with  other books from the series in a collector box.
Absolutely perfect Quick turn around from the states to Australia
Cheers 
Even though I havent read this book I know exactly what its about
If you have seen or read the first ten episodes of the Television show or manga Dragon Ball created by Akira Toryama in mid s youll see a similarity
The names are a little different but the basic story is identical
If you are a Dragon Ball fan youll see where Im coming from
This extremely long story about that old Chinese legend inspired the great Akira in writing the greatest Japanese story ever written
Mainly because it led to Dragon Ball Z and then finally to Dragon Ball GT which has still not appeared in English but probably will sometime in the near future
So Im going to but this story and see what else Akira based his popular Dragon Ball series on...
I really love this company
I will purchase from them again the book is as said in description very minor wear but everything else was in great condition.
This translation is not as flowery as the Anthony Yu translation and does not have the extensive footnotes but is a fun read
 Uses more modern language so its  not necessary to constantly look up references to understand the story.
it is a classic for a reason
 it is good in a good way
I ordered this product around Christmas time and it was intended to be a present for a friend
Unfortunately the order became lost in the mail
I contacted Amazon with questions and options on what I could do to still receive this book set and I received a prompt reply
The representative was very cooperative and friendly
A new box set was sent out soon after communications and that set was received within a week
Thanks for the great books everyone My friend is loving them.
This is a wonderful translation of the Journey to the West
 It is an unabridged translation therefore it is  books long
 But it is worth it
 Not only is it written clearly but it keeps the style of the original meaning that interwoven between pharagraphs of prose are poems
 This give the book a wonderful charm that the abridged prose versions lack
 The ancient Chinese thought such as yin and yang Daoism Chinese Buddhism also give the book an authentic flavor that enriches the experience of reading this classic
 It is still the same wonderful story of the michevous Monkey King his difficulties with the gods in heaven and his redeeming pilgramage with the Buddhist monkpriest Sanzang to find sutras
 For anyone seriously interested in this story and who doesnt read Chinese this is the edition for them
Delivery speed was ok
Shipping rate was great considering the size and weight of this book collection
Books quality is as expected for paper edition.
The Journey to the West has remained of the most popular and enduring works of fiction in China since it was first published in the late sixteenth century
 It is an allegory of Buddhist doctrine based on the real life pilgrimage of Tripitaka a Chinese monk who traveled to India in search of religions scripture in I believe the seventh century
 The very descriptive text contains some of the most astoundingly beautiful poetic passages I have ever encountered
 Footnotes contain references to everthing from historical notes to daily customs of the period
 This set of books is among the most treasured in my library.
Anthony Yu version has more back ground info than WJFJ version
The quality of books is very poor
The paper quality is poor printing quality is poor and binding quality is poor
However this is newer translation than Anthony Yu version 
Though I think some of poem are not right translation
Anthony Yu vesion is a bit diffcult to read.
I liked this book quite a bit
The translation is good and the translator has one a great effort to explain as much as heshe could to help you to understand anything that is mentioned and you mey be unable to understand
The only thing I found somewhat tiring was that the story becomes a little repetitive but besides that the story is really interesting though I got to hate Pig but..
shrug
The classic novel Journey to the West is well worth a read if you like Chinese history or enjoy studying religion or like mythology
While parts are dry the novel overall is really interesting and I found most of it to be very engaging
Even though Monkey is insanely overpowered and a lot of characters are twodimensional like Pig the problems of the party always present a challenge and the trouble they get into and the struggles they have to overcome are varied and dont get boring well most of the time anyway
Its a long story and some parts are very repetitive
While this book is rich in detail and shows the incredible and complex Chinese Buddhist mythology and traditions beautifully its obvious that the author had a real hatred of Taoists
If youre a scholar of Buddhism or Chinese religions this book is definitely a mustread but be aware of the biases
The biggest problems I had were that this set of books the novel is split into four parts doesnt seem to have been proofread against typos and also seems to have been printed on quite lowquality paper
Also some of the translation notes are cut off or are missing
Otherwise this is a brilliant set of books
Theyre well worth the price.
This book is a bit of an odd read but it is interesting I spent most of the train journeys reading this and bits of it are strange but it does link to the natural chinese history in ways which I was pleased about
A decent read but not the best of the chinese classics
I bought this as a mothers day gift as this is one of her favourite stories she loved the old TV series and she absolutely loved it
She spent the rest of the day annoying my Dad by reading out sections to him
Well worth the money
It was not clear this was part of a trilogy
really good so far am still on book one but I loved the abridged Monkey book so much Ive been loving this one
 there are a lot of translated poems and such in there which I dont get much out of but they probably were brilliant in the original language
 such a shame.
I give my review a fivestar rating because I really enjoy reading it
 It has exceeded my expectations
 I would certainly recommend to anyone who wants to have an understanding of a famous Chinese folklore
 In fact many Chinese today who practise traditional Chinese ancestor worship pray to the Monkey God and he is revered as a deity and many Chinese temples of statues of the Monkey God.
A wonderful rambling adventure full of magic wit and insights into old China
I never saw the popular TV series Monkey that came from this book but if you did you might like to read the book.
This is a lucid and superlative translation of this classic Chinese novel Arthur Waleys abridgment Monkeyis great for getting the flavour of Wu Chengens timeless novel but this complete translation by W.J.F Jenner illustrated with many Ching period woodcuts is a true delight and one at last appreciates the scope of Journey to the West in all its amazing detail  its a masterwork perhaps comparable to J.R.R Tolkiens Lord of the Rings and the narrative is rich with weird adventures bizarre and comedic episodes wild combats spiritual and poetic interludes and charged throughout with esoteric Taoist alchemical and Buddhist symbolism as we follow the way via many vicissitudes to the Western Heaven and the Greater Vehicle scriptures with our heroes the monk Tripitaka who is a sort of everyman on the spiritual quest through life the irrepressible Monkey who represents the mercurial mind so hard to control and also the amazing magical powers of the immortal Taoist adept which nonetheless need to learn to be motivated and guided by the higher quality of Compassion and placed in the service of the enlightened Buddhanature
Pigsy of course stands for the lower appetites and is a hilarious glutton and Friar Sand is a strange and earnest figure who defies definition
It would be a faint spirit indeed who could not take pleasure in the cunning strategems and heroic antics of the irascible Monkey King the Great Sage Equalling Heaven  these characters are archetypal aspects of each of us and their great quest mirrors the journey of the spirit
This  volume translation is a joy to read and the exquisite poems which are embedded throughout really add to the full appreciation of this wonderful and intricate novel
Like The Golden Ass of Apuleius it is richly humorous but beneath the phantastic episodes and the wild japes there is a serious message and purpose and the Journey to the West is a profoundly spiritual novel
Was there ever a hero like the Handsome Monkey King
Wonderful
Funny witty thought provoking
An absolute treat.
quality book.
excellent value and prompt delivery
A long read but well worth the time.
This is the first half of the story of Sun Wukong the MonkeyKing the piggy Shu Wuneng and the terrible Sha Wujing who in the Tangtime converted to Buddhism to accompaign the Tangpriest Sanzang to the Westerly Heaven  todays India  to find Buddha show him reference and return to the country of Tang with some Scriptures
Starting with Monkeys brith and teaching up to his revolt in the Heavenly Palace and his following banishment this book tells about how the four came together and about the first half of their monsters demons and other things infested journey
It is also a show and an indirect discussion of Taoism Buddhism and Konfuzianism and how this philosophical schools have influenced each other
The story of Monkey and his comrades has often been adapted to other forms like movies plays TVserials and comics e.g
Dragonball and is starting with its creation in the th century certainly one of the most influential pieces of literature  even if outside of China most people have seldom heard of it
The edition in hand is quite comprehensive but the editing is a bit sloppy so that quite often homophones have been mixed in the final text which makes the reading a bit strenuous in parts
For this  not for the quality of the work itself  one star has been deducted.
Una edicin compacta y completa de la obra a un precio inmejorable
Son cuatro volmenes y la calidad del papel es buena para una edicin compacta
Hay ilustraciones de la epoca y una buena introduccin ademas la editorial es para mi garanta.
Im still on Book One and Im finding it a great read
 I havent been this engrossed in a mythical work since Lord of the Rings
 This work predates that great work by centuries
 I love the mix of poetry and prose  that conveys what I imagine is true to the original Chinese
 I love it.
Please be careful when buying these sets Twice now I have purchased thinking all  volumes are included but unfortunately only  book has been given
Parfait tat dlais raisonnables.
Amazing storytelling
The books are awesome The product came very quickly and in pristine condition
Bought it for my son  was exactly as he expected it
Great condition
Product was as expected on time and at a good price.
This is a distillation of Yus faithful translation of the  chapter volume The Journey to the West the part historical part mythical epic of Chinese literature which has been the basis for numerous movies animes
and memes
 The essential first  chapters of the original which tell how Monkey becomes a force to be reckoned with are condensed to  most of the trimming comes after the divine monk Tripitaka Tang sets out to bring Buddhist scriptures from India back to China since his encounters with obstacles become a bit repetitive in the long version
The monk is actually the incarnation of a Heavenly being who volunteered to suffer human birth in order to bring the means of enlightenment to the people of the East
But once he is mortal he will lose his divine perceptions and be vulnerable to illusions deceptions and wrong thinking so he is assigned  assistants all of them immortals who have fallen into disgrace one way or another
Dont drop a teacup or set fire to Heavenly curtains and especially dont steal all the peaches
Their task is to transport him safely thereby winning their freedom to return to their former estates
This assignment is made difficult by several factors
At least two of the disciples loathe each other and are forever squabbling and fighting
Pigsy is lazy and wants to go back to eating meat and having sex Monkey wants to go back to being King of the Flower Fruit Mountain
Only the gold fillets that act like th century tasers keep the unruly disciples from rebellion
Thieves and politicians bar their way
The major difficulty however is that every monster who wants a short cut to immortality bypassing all that tedious selfcultivation wants to devour the monk for it is widely known that even one mouthful of Tripitakas flesh will prolong life and making a meal of him will bestow longevity
Time and time again Monkey exerts himself on the monkd behalf saving Tripitaka from hungry monsters who disguise themselves as damsels in distress or feeble patriarchs when they dont simply capture the travelers by a frontal assault
The story is magnificent adventure incorporating poetry allusions to esoteric medicine and meditation practices breathtaking descriptions of travel ferocious fight sequences and braggadocio exchanges between combatants
It is so refreshing to encounter a classic that isnt inherently a tragedy based on war or lust for power thirst for revenge
Instead this epic centers around a quest to benefit all of creation by promoting enlightenment
In the style of the poems included in this translation here is a summary From a mountain stone egg is born The Mind Monkey
This one studies the Tao Masters transformations and defeats the lords of death Devours immortal peaches and Heavenly feasts Challenges the divine champions Defeating all  all but one
Only Quanyins intercession Frees Monkey to pursue once again The Way as a Heavenly monks disciple One of four magical beings who serve and guard Tripitaka Tang on his quest for scriptures
Not always willingly
Pigsy loves earthy pleasures Monkey resorts to violence
Over mountains and across rivers Eluding traps and subduing demons The five companions refine their spirits
Who will find the Way within the way
First off Im really glad this was an abridgment the chapter fourvolume complete story sounds utterly overwhelming
Ive read long books and Ive read the entire Harry Potter series multiple times but classic books are at time more difficult to digest than modern novels
Secondly remember that this story is hundreds of years old
Some of the storytelling styles are oldschool
If youve read other ancient books and stories you might know what I mean
Its not organized the way a modern story might be and while it is entertaining it had its own religious goals as well
But dont forget to enjoy the ridiculous antics the characters often take part in
This leads me to my next point it helped me to have some background knowledge before reading this book
While the translatoreditor of this book adds a few footnotes it doesnt explain the basics
To enjoy this story more I would recommend attaining a little background knowledge of Buddhism Confucianism Daoism and ancient China
But no worries on becoming an expert This is still an enjoyable story at times adventurous and at times hilarious
I had to look up some things such as what does kowtow mean and what are the eight trigrams and the like
But as I familiarized myself with this book and its contents I began to understand some of the references to it
For example I discovered that many animes draw on mythologies including this story
Goku in Dragon Ball is based on the monkey of this book as is a tailed beast in Naruto
Other references especially in anime but not exclusively came not directly from this book but from religious charactersitemsstoriesetc
mentioned in this book
I feel like I learned a lot both in reading this book and seeking to understand not only the story itself but the background that goes into it.
This labor of love from Anthony Yu is an amazing translation for English readers  In the preface Mr
Yu discusses his reasons for wanting to provide a culturally accurate translation for English readers
 Being a native speaker of Chinese and growing up in the culture as well as being a professor of Asian studies and history in an English speaking country is really what makes this translation so amazing
 The footnotes at the bottom of each page were an especially nice detail
Oftentimes with weighty classics like this all the footnotes are either at the end of the book with the appendices or at the end of the chapter
 This leads to a lot of fumbling around and flipping pages back and forth and can subsequently take you out of your reading experience
 It is also easier at least for me to forget some of the context of what I was reading doing all this flipping back and forth
 Not only do the footnotes themselves add immensely to the depth of understanding of the material but having them at the bottom of the page they are referencing makes reading easy and enjoyable
 Culture specific footnotes really helped me understand the intensity of the situations I was reading about as well as just how funny this book is
As far as the story itself I think everyone should read it
 The story is hilarious and surprisingly modern in its storytelling despite the time it was written
 So many of the most famous animes in pop culture clearly have taken major inspiration from this story
 DBZ alone has ripped off so many elements youll find yourself laughing at the similarities if you have ever watched DB or DBZ
Highly HIGHLY recommend  Read now please
This long but nevertheless abbreviation of the Chinese classic story of the journey from China to India of the Buddhist monk Tripitaka to bring to China manuscripts of the teachings of the Buddha
The characters are spectacular especially Monkey whose magical performances save the mission from disaster
The bizarre adventures involving magic and courage are at times very amusing and always astonishing at the invention and imagination of those who wrote this amazing and highly readable scholarly translated work
The story has been translated into many languages made into films and simplified versions published for children
Not to be missed.
Ugh this is just not an entertaining read for me
 The humor may bring a chuckle to Asian readers of the th century Ming dynasty but this is way too dry for me
 I would suggest checking it out from a library prior to purchasing it to see if it is what you expected
 Just because everyone else tells you that the monkey is handsome dont believe them like the Emperor of old he wears no clothes.
GREAT book
I have never read the  version but I imagine it must leave out a LOT
Considering Anthony C Yus full unabridged version is  times the length of his here abridged version this version is a great starting point
A must read for all interested in Chinese literature and a MUST for all Dragonball fans You really get a sense of Goku and his world by reading this classic epic story.
Good translation and the abbreviated version maintains the spirit and I dont feel like I miss much by not purchasing each individual tome
Cool book
LOTS of typos
Is it hard to pay people to read these things before you publish them
You probably need to appreciate ancient Chinese culture and its historic interaction with Buddhism to appreciate this novel
This was a delightful journey with a group of colorful characters that keep struggling to learn and grow
The rhythm of the story telling becomes a fun structure for these little adventures
I didnt miss the unabridged version for a moment.
Incredibly well written such that it seems to preserve the culture and voice of the original work
It is excellent and does not feel like youre reading sparknotes which is the experience I had with a different translated abridgement of Journey to the West.
Loved this version and sent it as a birthday gift to my son who loved it as well
Great story to share with your kids
Recommend it all over the place.
I love Journey to the West  the story is Chinas version of The Canterbury Tales and the tales found within are both seminal works of Chinese literature and rewarding reads in and of themselves
 For this particular edition Anthony Yu does a good job of translating into English the prose text is very readable and Yus footnotes provide a lot of help on obscure references to Chinese superstitions and Buddhist heritage
 The translations of the poems are somewhat less satisfying and I found myself frequently skipping over them to read just the prose storyline
 My main complaint is with the books Yu decides to include here out of the  chapters of the full edition Yu includes only the  chapters that are crucial to the plotline
 As a result you get the barebones story but some of the bestwritten and most comical subplots are left out
 All in all though a pretty good read especially for anyone looking for the middle ground between the comic book versions and the full volume chapter text.
What a great book I was sad when I got to the end that there was no more
Its amazing it was written hundreds of years ago and still has relevant moderns themes and insights
The mix of Taoism Buddhism and Confucianism is special
Such an unusual story of myth fairytale proverb and religion all with beautiful imagery and fun.
If a story seemed too long because of the vast amount of volume and you just want a good read in one book
This is it
Journey to the West is an epic that needs to be read and this is the version to read in one go.
This is a superb printing of this translation in a manageable soft cover.
Anthony Yu indeed is an excellent translator summing up the most essential chapters to give a flavor of the importance spiritual depth of this book
It will engage readers to want to study further in his full translation version
One of the best told stories of all time
Thank you
The story is so full of adventure  I can see why its still so popular after so long 
a classical must read chinese epic
I guess it alright.
Very interesting book
This is the best translation you will find Anthony C Yu has really made this book shine it displays all that only people who can read Chinese could only know until now previous books in English on the monkey king have been dry and lacking in spirit this book is beautifully descriptive and spiritually deep at the same timebut dont let the word spiritual throw you off this book is full of adventure and excitement not a boring moment to be found
.P.S
this is the abridged version of the  volume full version.I usually dont bother with abridged books but got this one to read to my ...sonnot only does my son love thisbut I love just as much as the whole set
After reading the complete set a few years ago I thought it would be fun to reread the abridged version when it came out
As far as I can tell the author has simply selected certain chapters from the full set to create this one book version
Im realizing now that I dont really want to skip chapters Whats the rush anyhow When I finish this Ill be looking for my next book to read
I believe the first  chapters are the same in BOTH versions so if unsure you could start with the short one and switch over...
Glad to have it.
This an abridgement of a famous Chinese novel beloved by kids and adults all over as Asia
Unfortunately this a not very readable translation that appears to be aimed at scholars The choice of multisylabic  words where simple words
There is also a lot a obscure Buddhist and  Taoist poetry interspersed in the text that I could not head nor tails of
Very distracting from the story.
This book is a great book to use to learn about Chinese culture
The story here is a classical of Chinese literature and is written in a way that makes it clear for anyone to understand
A good read.
TMatM tells a story that happens to be one of the most wellknown tales in Asia The Monkey Kings Journey to the West
The story is profound and funny  and very different from any tale you may hear in this  side of the globe
By reading it you get to know a lot about the basis of a whole culture
The Monkey King was the inspiration  direct or otherwise  for many mang creators
Suggested for people who are really interested in the Asian culture.
Mr Yu already translated the entire book and did it very well
That translation has been extant for around  years
So why publish only a little readers digest condensed one I want the whole thing for my Kindle
I would be happy to pay commensurately with the increased volume
Come on give us a break people who read this stuff at all want the whole thing.
Interesting to note that Xuanzangs journey coincided with the Taoist alchemists failed attempt to create the elixir of life immortality
He blundered into gunpowder instead thus sending mankind down the road to Prometheus Pandora and perdition rather than up and over the fabled hill of Sisyphus to the Shangrila realm of Asklepios and Panacea
The tamed Monkey controlled initially by a fillet and later by himself represents the victory of Buddhisms metaphorical immortality over Taoisms failed experiments in real immortality
 Had Tony Yu made this point in his preface Id have given him  stars
Note  Joseph Needham is very good on Taoist alchemy and gunpowder.
 The translation is poor
 For example when Sun Wukong Monkey calls himself lao sun in Chinese Yu translates that into old Monkey
 This is just dumb
 Something like a plain I or this old monkey would have worked better
 There are many such examples
 The translated English text almost requires you to know Chinese to understand
 Definitely not for the masses
 I cant believe most of the stories in the nd half of the original novel are omitted
 This abridged edition seems to focus on the first half of the Xiyouji Journey to the West novel
 Great stories like the Ox King and the nymphs are completely cut out
 This is just absolutely terrible
 On the other hand the uninteresting semireligious side stories about the origin of Xuanzang Tang Sanzang are kept
 Whats more all those poems in the chapters that are included here are retained  you know Chinese poems shi and ci that are extremely difficult to translate which should have been left out of an abridged edition
In short dont get this book
 Its absolutely terrible and a waste of money
 You might as well get the unabridged translation by either Yu expensive or by Waley old but affordable
 But if you really want to appreciate the great novel you should study Chinese  years fulltime and then read the original Chinese edition.
I brought the book to read at a book group and it elicited an excellent wide ranging discussion.
Great abridgment of a Chinese classic  still feels like youre reading something ancient without being totally incomprehensible.
Just as ordered.
Love it I would recommend anyone to read this book
NOT THE FULL TEXT....these are the  cliff notes......product page is awful.
This is a  page summary of the book
Ordered this thinking it was the full text because it doesnt say otherwise in the description.
Looks like someone printed a PDF I could have found for free online
The book is too wide and tall and the layout indentation and general typography are awful.
I want to tell future readers of this book in this way
I read it first when I was  or 
I thought it was a book on how to smartly fight a war
Then I reread it when I was  and it occurred to me that it may be an instruction book on how to navigate an honorable life
Years passed and I recently found it at the bottom of a box in my closet
I read it again at age 
I realized it has more to offer
If you read this book you will actively have to replace Sun Tzus ancient terms and placement of hierarchy and apply them to modern situations and people
Family bosses neighbors employees and the list goes on
It is my belief that this manual can help solve minor and major disruptions in life if used correctly
It is a book meant for good.
This is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL
 It should say PUBLIC DOMAIN as it is like a copy from someone who took notes off of someone who took notes who took notes off someone who doesnt even write in the English language  It is woefully abridged to the max looks like it was not edited or proofread and I loathe it
 AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL
This is the single best translation of The Art of War  the one used in history courses and the military
Why Because its JUST The Art of War
No long intros
No authors notes
No commentary
No  pages of history or Sun Tzu biography
Its simply the text of The Art of War translated by an international group of Chinese and Englishspeaking scholars
Period
Its the definitive text
Complaining about it being short is like complaining about the Gettysburg Address being short
It IS short
Thats the POINT
If you want to read dozens of pages of commentary and history and footnotes and acknowledgements buy a lesser version
If you want to read The Art of War buy this one.
Idk maybe I didnt read the reviews in my Xmas shopping haste But this is NOT The Art of War youre used to
This is a very thin  page cliffnote version
And itd be nice if they listed that pertinent fact in the headline  Kinda just a waste of resources sending it back of time for me and a loss for the seller
Annoying.
Interesting book everybody sites The Art of War as the top book for combat business and all types of other endeavors
Its a little difficult to just read however it has tons of wise principles
You do have to think somewhat abstractly in order to benefit from this book but overall I think its worth having and worth reading
Certainly not the type of book you would read like anovel...
I really appreciate having read this book
It oriented my mind in a favorable way towards using and thinking about certain mindfulnessbased strategical tactics
I appreciate the guidance and motivational support written within the pages
This was a quick easy read for me and will be a lasting reference for years to come
I highly suggest this to everybody
It is a classic mustread in my opinion
I was not compensated in any way for this review
I like to give open honest and transparent feedback about products I like to try
I hope you found this review to be useful

It seems like I have heard about the classic book The Art of War for as long as I can remember
I finally decided to buy the book from Amazon
Red flags bells and whistles should have went off inside my head when I only paid 
for the book
This is not the original book that I had anticipated reading
This is more or less a summary of The Art of War by Sun Tzu
It is my responsibility to be aware of what I am purchasing
I rated this book with stars because I did find nuggets of wisdom splattered throughout the book
Beware If you intend on purchasing The Art of War by Sun Tzu the 
is not the copy to buy.
This was an incredibly economical buy
A good price on a legendary literary work
However it should be pointed out that this was a public domain reprint and the publishing company did not cite nor include the translator of this piece in any way it is simply The Art of War by Sun Tzu
The quality of the print is very good and the material seems to all be there although there are many blank pages as shown in the attached image
Again I did not notice any material actually missing or out of context
I would not purchase this book if you are looking to reference it for scholarly sources or any work in which you would have to reference the content directly
I would definitely encourage the buy if it is for personal use or work that does not require proper citations.
If you have inconsistent or poor performances on your team you NEED to read this book If you are the type of leader that is too nice and you feel like your employees take advantage of you you NEED to read this book If your employees are terrified of you you NEED to read this book This is how this book changed my life My first big promotion was getting the General Manager position of a restaurant at  years old and I did everything I could to make my employees happy bringing the principals from First Break All the Rules What the Worlds Greatest Managers Do Differently which is also imperative to help you measure and understand how to make an amazing work environment for your employees and it worked wonders at first
My employees were happy and my customer reviews sky rocketed However over time some employees started to push the lines of respect with me and others and some just started to outright ignore me or give me attitude
I was devastated How could they treat me disrespectfully after I had spent months bending over backwards finding out and giving them everything they needed to be happy at work I praised them tirelessly I thanked them constantly I encouraged them I personally trained them I got them equipment and supplies they need to do a good job I was spending oneonone time with each of them would ask how their lives were etc I was the nicest boss...
who was also turning out to be a pushover
You can have all the kindness in the world but it makes your team useless if you have no discipline at the same time The Bible says God disciplines His children BECAUSE He loves us
Otherwise we turn into monsters Which is what I was beginning to experience with my team
I HAD NO DISCIPLINE and NEITHER DID MY TEAM
Why would they respect me I thought discipline was bad punishment you gave and punishment was mean
Nope..
turns out every team needs it and if you are CONSISTENTLY and FAIRLY giving predictable and forewarned discipline all the time along with kindness which Sun Tzu talks about in the book as well you will have an amazing team
This is my favorite quote from the book that finally turned the light bulb on for me  Page   If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you they will not prove submissive and unless submissive then will be practically useless
If when the soldiers have become attached to you punishments are not enforced they will still be useless
Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity but kept under control by means of iron discipline
This is a certain road to victory
If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced the army will be welldisciplined if not its discipline will be bad
If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed the gain will be mutual
AND YES IT WAS Over time not only did my employees love coming into work EVEN MORE but they worked harder my customers were happier and so was I
People are comforted to know their boss will always be kind AND fair
If you never know how your boss will treat you it creates uncertainty and anxiety with the team that always leaks out to the customers
It took me only a couple weeks to begin fully implementing this mindset with my employees
At first Im not going to lie it shocked them a bit and they didnt believe when me I would tell them I would be disciplining them if they didnt follow through or finish a direct order I had given them
I had to fire one manager who was undermining me to the team and then everyone saw I was serious and fell right into line
Of course I did all of this will extreme kindness
Discipline should never be nasty or hateful or done when you are fuming angry
The employees need kind proper and consistent warnings before they receive any consequences which I learned to start doing right from onboarding them at orientation saved me a lot of time and trouble and then if and when the time comes for the formal discipline they know by then that it was totally their choice and you are only following through on what you said would happen
There are SO MANY MORE GREAT QUOTES in this book
Just get it
Get a highlighter and pick out the diamonds that you need
Go over them time and again and become the amazing leader of your life and of your team you are meant to be
Ordered for my daughter who is in ministry and all  campuses of her ministry are required to study this book
She received a flimsy pamphlet if you will that is not the book itself
Extremely disappointed as she ordered this about a month ago and it just arrived and shes already behind because it should not have taken this long to receive a book when I have a Prime account
Then to receive the incorrect book made things worse and we cannot go out and purchase the book for her to have immediately
This was a huge waste timeconsuming and extremely disappointing
We should have read the reviews first as we see there are others whove encountered this same problem.
As a person who has a  passion for reading I am also a young teenager who is often times lost on what direction to go in life
After reading this book and studying the literature within this ancient book I feel like I can accomplish my hardest challenges.
Very nice and great for desktop but i didnt realize it was a tiny version
I order these leather look books all the time and they are always standard to large size so my bad for not reading the description
That said nice product and great to just toss around on a desktop or whatever......too small for a bookshelf
Love it keeping and reading it but a little pricey for th size as i get full size volumes for my collection all the time for this price.
I really wish I had read all the reviews before purchasing this
It is all things you can find online for free
 pages of wide set typing and this authors take on what is actually in the real book
This thing is TINY because it is not the entire text
This is really false advertising
I didnt want a book report by an unknown source.
Confused 
Is this supposed to be a summary I only see bulletin points
Not what I expected
Do not buy this book
Its a small preview of the real Art of War book
Consider this if you get this book its about  total pages
The real Art of War is  pages
That means if you buy this book youll be missing  pages from the real book
Thats a lot of important information
This is a scam book do not buy it
Spend your money elsewhere.
Are you person of interest of war Are you a strategist Do you like war What entices you If you answer all of these questions this book will definitely make worth of your enjoyment during your boring or slow day
Itll be like taking a candy from a baby once you finish this book
However if you plan to buy this book you must be ready and be willing to be a fighter like the wind such as Muhammad Ali Yi Soon Shin and other great heroes who have fought through many challenges and won them through the end.
This Audio Book has no commentary and is the writings of The Art of War by Sun Tzu only
I have The Art of War in written form with and without Commentary and frankly like the version without commentary better
I really like this Audio version
The reader has a good voice easy to understand and doesnt interject his personal emotional  feeling during the reading
It is read in narrative form without the reading of Chapter number or or number of the paragraphs
For example Attack by Fire or The Use of Spies followed by Sun Tzu says then the subject under that heading
 This is actually a plus for me since its very easy to follow the logic under each area of instruction making a very smooth easy to follow narrative
A person can follow along with a written copy if they wish but I found myself laying the book down kicking back and simply listening to the smooth logical easy to follow reading
This is a small audio book but very enjoyable and still instructional
I have listened to this several times and still learn and just plain enjoy the reading
 At  years old that sometimes isnt easy with some Audio Books I have
I do recommend this one
You can download this into Media Player and make a Playlist the chapter headings are shown you cant bookmark if you stop but I simply write down the chapter I stopped in and the verse on a slip of paper in my written copy which allows me to come back later and pick up where I left off in the Audio Book
There may be an easier way but I dont know it
Hope this helps someone.
Historical references in translated Chinese and other notes litter the text making it very difficult to follow the flow and primary scope of the book
Secondly there are hundreds of instances of spaces missing between words How the heck does that happen Who proofread this book a year old It was free so theres that
Im thinking of spending money and purchasing a different version that I can actually follow.
Im about halfway through the book and its very well written straight to the point and easy to grasp
Love it
There is a minor typo on page  
It says effected by the science..
should be affected by the...
I highly doubt anyone would be thrown off by this typo or even notice it just figured Id mention it if you plan on coming out with a new edition at some point
Sorry Im a little ocd at times
But as I said I absolutely love the book and the way its laid out
This was selfpublished
To make some money I suppose
Nothing wrong with that
But it shows poor editing
A number of misspelled words and a few other errors that could have been detected if the editing were better.
This is one of those books that should be a mandatory read in school probably high school in order to have the students understand the ideas and concepts presented
I finally read this book after retiring from work and found that a lot of the ideas such as the one who plans beforehand will succeed were things I learned while working and some of the rest were more or less common sense
If more people read this while they were teenagers I think we would have a population that was a bit more commonsensical about their lives instead of just going with what feels best at the moment.
This is the cliff note version of The Art of War
This is falsely advertised and I am extremely disappointed
Returning it ASAP.
the Art of War by Sun Tzu is a concise treatise packed with wisdom
 Countless reams of scholarly research has been generated in the millenia since Sun Tzu wrote this masterpiece
Unfortunately this edition seems to jam all of that research as inline notes into the text itself
 It is virtually impossible to distinguish what Sun Tzu wrote contrasted against what someone else wrote about Sun Tzu
 The research is good its just impossible to read through
I tried to read this but got so fed up that I edited of the Art of War with all of the notes and research linked into an appendix instead of inline with the text
 As a result you can read the Art of War free from the interruptions and distractions of scholars and analysts
 Still if you want that research its available in the appendix
 Every section links to its related notes and even the related notes link to one another
In full disclosure I am the editor of the copy that I linked to but I think youll find it much easier to read
 After all I should
 If you prefer this free edition do yourself a favor and start at location 
 That is the beginning of Sun Tzus work and will let you skip all of the introduction which is little more than the translators story of this work.
The book is a shortened version
I thought this was the full version
Amazon let me return it with no issues
The book was in great condition and would have been perfect if it was the full version.
Theres a reason this is a classic
However this copy ups it quite a bit by making the page font not to big but not trying to smash as must text together as possible I found the read enjoyable
Great words of wisdom inside but the quality of the book itself is top notch
Its cheap and shipped fast which is great given COVID
Definitely add this to your book collection.
The delivery was quick  the book arrived in great condition it was new
The Art of War I have heard this book quoted often
It has some medium and some very interesting parts
Many broad generalizations
To apply it to business is malpractice too Machivalian
It is a quick read and I recommend it just to be well rounded in a literary sense
I have heard it described as the ramblings of a retired General which seems accurate
I recommend reading it.
Made me want to go to war with my dog....
very informative and a great outlook on life
THIS BOOK IS NOT CLIF NOTES This is The Art of War as written by Sun Tzu and translated to English
This version however does not include the commentary by the translator
There has been many versions of The Art of War translated into English over the years by many different people and all of them will vary in length
The bulk of the book that people are talking about is the sometimes  pages of commentary by the translator and in some editions a  page forword and sometimes a  page introduction
This is the bare bones unabridged edition of The Art of War as written by Sun Tzu and translated into English
You are not missing any content from The Art of War itself
You are just missing in my opinion meaning was commentary from the translator and any forwards or introductions some versions may have
As far as Sun Tzus writings they are fully intact.
Not really what I was expecting
If you want the cliff notes of a masterpiece so you can tell your friends youve read it this is for you
 If you want the real thing pay better attention than I did.
ISBN  I bought this book and it was seriously shorter than I thought
It is the book with a black cover and white font on it
It had absolutely no commentary or anything in it
Just the stuff by Sun Tzu
Still....its so short I guess for the price it makes sense
As for word choice in this particular book Wikipedia had better translations of the chapters
For example chapter  in the book is labeled Attack by Stratagem
It feels so clumsy compared to Strategic Attack
With the amount of blank pages in the bookafter every chapter they could have easily filled in the original Chinese for side by side comparison
I probably would have just read this online
A paper copy is good to have around but because the price is cheap the book paper quality is cheap as well
There seems to be little effort in formatting too
The book is in an ubiquitous font like Times New Roman
This book simply did not fit my needs for the reasons above and I will probably be searching for another book
However if you are looking to have a simple copy of The Art of War in paperback form this is the right book for you.
Great book a lot of knowledge on how cut throat the world is
Definitely had some life lessons in here my favorite quote from the book If you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle Each chapter has a life lesson you can apply to your everyday life
The Art of War is the book for both military history buffs and would be business leaders since the principles and strategies outlined by Sun Tzu are applicable on the battle field and in the meeting room
That being said I have read other versions of this book over the years and have always found something of interest so when my college age daughter asked me about it we picked up this one for her Kindle
I was surprised when she said it was hard to follow so downloaded it to my Kindle and I was shocked that Thomas Cleary went way over the top with his comments and analysis bogging down the flow and relatively easy understand original language
In fact it is the clear and simple way Sun Tzu expressed his rules that has made his book so popular and relevant for the past  years or so
The solution is straight forward enough since the translation is good all of the text is there and it is easy enough to skim through Mr
Clearys contributions
Recommended with the above caveats
CFH
I ordered this book for a Psychology class I was taking so it was a required read
I actually ordered is via Amazon for Kindle
It was an easy read nothing really to complex or difficult to understand
Basis of this book is that it was written in China over two thousand years ago Sun Tzus The Art of War provides the first known attempt to formulate a rational basis for the planning and conduct of military operations
His essays contain principles acted upon by such twentiethcentury Chinese generals as Mao Zedong
The book is translated by the late Samuel B
Griffith
Samuel Griffith offers an insightful translation of this classic which makes it even more relevant to the modern world
If you are taking a class and need the book or just want to brush up on your twentieth century military tactics I suggest this book
I hope this review helps.
I thought it was gonna be a big book like the original scripture but i guess its ok for a short read replica.
I havent served in a military so Im not qualified to comment on the quality of the analysis in this book
 However according to Wikipedia many military organizations and many successful generals have read and benefitted from this work
 Based on their reputations Ill accord this classic the respect that it claims
Throughout the book the author describes the morale and motivation of people and how it will affect what they actually do
 An army is not a collection of chess pieces or cardboard counters that behave according to some printed rules
 Its a group of humans that will fight retreat give up or go crazy depending on what they experience
I have to take off one star
 The free Kindle edition has an overly long introduction plus a large amount of inbody notes
 The inbody notes look way to similar to the text
 I want to read more of Sun Tzus words and more important I want it obvious which words are Sun Tzus and which are not.
Life handing you nothing but lemons Need to get the upperhand Eager to learn how to walk that fine line that makes the difference between winning or losing Then this is the book to read Want to learn how to always come out on topno fussno muss Then READ THIS BOOK  The Art Of War is a howtomanual for difficult situations
Learn how to handle a situation without the situation handling youlearn how to handle a situation correctly
The wisdom in this book is solid reliableandit works You can apply the advice and wisdom in this book to so many dynamics in your life
So  much in life depends on success...............in fact what doesnt Heres the howtomanual
A bargain at any price
A wise investment indeed
Im giving it the thumbsup
Lessons from this book can help you in many facets of your life
Not just war..
but that too
There are a number of factors that make this book worthwhile although not necessarily the ones I expected
 I thought this would be a metaphor for life or business but its actually a pretty tactical book on the details of prosecuting a war
 Its one of those books that is so broadly read and studied that its pretty necessary background for studying wars generally
 If you are reading other books on war for example you can be pretty sure that most of the players have been influenced by this book
 Further theres just a lot of interesting advice in here There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare and thus there are instructions on how important it is to bring a conflict to a head and a swift conclusion
 Its a classic for a reason and even if you dont find it compelling given the sheer number of people that have been influenced by it it becomes a must read based on that alone
 I can certainly imagine Ill be quoting from this on multiple occasions.
If you have a thirst for knowledge it is power get this read it and read it again
I bought handful and just gave them away
First read it mid s in the ARMY but when I came back to it in a different stage in life was able to apply it still
I forgot how helpful this book is
Stay blessed stay ready.

Stars is misleading I should have looked more closely
 This is NOT the full book as others point out
 If you dig you can find that out from the listing but its not immediately clear so its deceitful
 All can be had for free with a simple Google search.
It is just a confusing translation not really accurate I read it before in other language and it had more context and content so they may cut it out a little bit also there are  principal rules written by Sun Tzu in the book they describe  just different I dont like it.
The Art of War is required reading for U.S
Marine officers so I wanted to get my own copy for my bookshelf
Of course the best option would be to learn Chinese and study the original text
Short of that a good translation is required
If Mr
Giles is a good translator hes a horrible editor
This edition uses no style markings to denote what is from the original or what is editorial
As you can see by viewing the first few pages on this items page you can see that everything runs together
The reader cant possibly get a feel for the style or composition of the original because the entire text is peppered with commentary not all of which is bracketed off by the the editor and none of which is even set into its own area or paragraph
There are no footnotes endnotes or index
Keep looking if youre interested in reading Sun Tzus masterpiece
Ill update this review when Ive found an edition suitable for reading and recommendingthis one is going back to Amazon today.
This book was an adequate copy
The book I received was the full length text but chapter  and  were switched in the book for some reason though
Some of the translations were different from other publications of the book
I believe that this book does not read as well as some other publications because of the differences in phrasing but this does not hurt the content of the text
Seems as if this publisher is a bit of a dice roll with what some of the other reviews are saying but there does seem to be a positive trend.
You buy stuff cheap thats what you get cheap stuff
I think this was literally printed on standard bond print paper in  pt times new roman or something
more like a pamphlet than a book.
I was looking to reference the Art of War by Sun Tzu so I decided to order a copy
I must say that this is only a Part of the original dare say a footnote of the original
 Very disappointed
Now I need to order a full copy of the book somewhere...
smh.
I watched a documentary about Sun Tzu and I decided to read the book
I didnt personally like the way this book is written its all numbered and based on different topics and themes but overall the content of this book is gold
One of my favorite find from the book was Let your rapidity be that of the wind and your compactness that of the forest
Dont buy its a weird fake abbreviated version check the other reviews if you dont believe me.
This should be removed from the store  its clear this version was autogenerated either badly autotranslated or generated using synonyms from an existing translation to avoid copyright issues its literally junk and doesnt make sense Sample sentence the highquality issue of all is to take the enemys united states of america entire and intact
Really bugs me that Amazon allows this kind of thing to slide very frustrating.
This book is better than the Bible
This book is older than the Bible
This book is the Bible of War
The ancient practical advise imparted in this book is still relevant today and is applicable to every instance of human competition known your enemy as you know yourself develop a strategy vary your tactics strength is in unity and plan in secrecy
I looked for one good man amongst a million but I could not find one good woman spies.
Its a good book got this for my boyfriend because hes a man and hes easily influenced he heard a pod cast guy say its a good book bought this book for him as a valentines gift amd read before handing it over its an easy ready not long finished it in a day
The Kindle version of the book is missing spaces between words
 With this deficiency layered on the authors frequent bracketed interjections footnotes and crosspage references addition of numerous names and locations the core message is all but unintelligible for me as a first time reader of the Art of War and novice in Chinese history and historical geography
 The author seeks to improve upon previous translations by pulling the best from each adding his own and contextualizing
 This noble purpose may have backfired because I am leaving this version of the book feeling I should have read Tu Mus version which the author quoted frequently and which seems lucid and easy to understand.
Nowhere in the description did it state that this was not the full work
I feel duped
DO NOT RECOMMEND 
Everyone should read this book
I have revisited this book many times over the years and am always glad I did
A lot of lessons to be learned
And while I dont find myself at War often there are amazing lessons here that can be applied to everyday interactions that just about everyone of us find ourselves in
Its well worth your time to read this book.
Art of War is an ancient Chinese text on the practice of warfare both physical and psychological
While much of the treatise is metaphorical in expression with a little critical thinking the axioms of warfare are true in many aspects of life
This edition includes many annotations which relate the expressions to other Chinese texts on martial activities and commentaries on the manuscript itself which can be helpful in understanding the metaphors
When reading one should bear in mind that while the text particularly relates to warfare the values which are promulgated therein can be readily applied to principles of business multiple levels of security and personal life.
A very abridged version of the writings
Lots of lists of the key points
Good as a quick reference but not the fully written out philosophy
 Sort of the Cliff Notes version not that makes it bad.
Sunzi was renowned for his battle strategies and philosophies
His writing are among the classics of must read art of warfare around today regardless of how many thousands of years old it may be
This book provide readers with the understanding of war how to attack and enemy and how to defeat an enemy
I am a warrior at heart and in practice I work in a field of enforcement so knowing my enemy and well as knowing myself is a real philosophy
Keep my friends close and my enemies closer another aspect of this war masters doctrine.
Dont let the  star reviews scare you
This is the complete addition
Sun tzu wrote on chop sticks so it is written like little words of wisdom
Its not a traditional book that is going to teach you how to win a war
If the reader is looking for wisdom you will find wisdom in this book.
Review is for this edition which is made to order
Several typos and spacing issues
The translation leaves a bit to be desired but since theres not a lot of printing info its hard to that being said
It was produced professionally at a notably low price for a new book
 Was a superior reading experience than printing the text offline and reading that way
Recommended for anyone who wants to bust through a common classic text
For me its a primer for pursuing an older edition.
This book is OK
 Font is large enough and reading is easy
 I guess I got spoiled because I had a different version of the book with Samuel B
Griffith but gave it away a few years back in a purge of my shelves
 I shouldnt have let that one go  its a gem
 All you get with this one is the barebones translation of the script
It is however much less expensive
 I am glad I read the other book I mentioned with the background material and analysis
 The original script is an ancient writing in Chinese and a little difficult to understand without some background or comment
 I suggest that if you want to understand the meanings of Sun Tzu more fully buy the other book.
Ive been reading and rereading The Art of War for several years I can see I will continue to read it over and over
So much to learn in a way you cant forget it
I wish this book was longer
I only feel kind of prepared for war
If Sun Tzu put more effort into writing this book I might be better suited for wars
It was still a good purchase though
No regerts
 stars
Must read
NY Times bestseller fo sho.
as all the top reviews state this is not a full text of the Art of War and the advertising is extremely misleading in this sense
Who would order a book just to read a summary I managed to cancel my purchase but I am confused about how the average review appears to be  stars yet all the reviews I am reading are one star and the positive reviews are just people saying how much they love the Art of War not mentioning this specific product
Very misleading.
The book arrived sooner than expected so was able to add it to the birthday gifts for the  year old grandson
Since he is all about playing with military toys and mounting pretend battles
This will be a great  addition to the basic principles hell learn from the  BABY which is really fine for kids to age  or so version of The Art of War which he can read and understand now.
Not the full book Very misleading as this book appears to have carried over the reviews from the actual book
This one is literally  pages.
This is a review for the Kindle edition which is formatted perfectly well with the lists and punctuation all in place and the illustrations coming out viewable and intelligible on both my iPad and Kindle Touch st gen
Sun Tzus Art of War is a timeless classic with much of its philosophy still applicable if not all of its strategies as geography is not much an issue in modern warfare although many are still disturbingly accurate against the tests of time
This is a must have for every Kindleowner and is something everyone should read once in their lives.
Written centuries ago this book is the general guide for every situation we will encounter in life not only at war
In simple words it will show you why so many military campaigns have failed such as Vietnam or to be more current the war on the Middle East which is drying our economy dry besides the housing market crash
Actually think of the Art of War as the art of fighting everyday challenges and our personal wars and conflicts
Every person in the government every teacher every student every household must read this book and keep it close as a reference whenever we dont know how to proceed with difficult decisions or challenges.
not the whole book and does not tell you thats its not the full book
Wow This is not only about war but you can apply this to almost any endeavor and learn how to win consistently
It teaches you that winning is mostly about preparation planning teamwork and above all knowing both yourself and your opponent
It does not just say these things it also tells you the how and the why with examples
 Be aware this is a translation from ancient Chinese so the translator has inserted notes about the difficulty of translating the true meaning of certain passages
 However in all he does a great job
 This is the book that ALL great generals have read
Charge on
This book is not only a great read about military strategies but about how to keep house in your life and business.
This is NOT the version of ART OF WAR that most people are searching for
 Perhaps Amazon should include a page count in the description
 This version is more like a pamphlet with a glossy cover
 The information is very simple translation of military strategy taken from ancient text
 Nothing contained in these pages pertain to the life of a modern day person
 If thats what you are seeking...find a different version.
Flipping through it I glean bits and pieces of an organized mind
I can easily understand why this book has existed for more than  years
My intention is to read it a little at a time so that I absorb some of the philosophy
I am not interested in war but I am interested I how men think and plan this should be an excellent guidebook.
I have managed to wear out several printed copies of Sun Tzu over the years
While the book IS about warabout forming and implementing strategies and drawn from real life experience Sun Tzus lessons can be applied effectively in any life situation involving  or more peoplethe more adversarial the better LOL
Sun Tzu has stood by me through thick and thinhis sage advice has made a big difference in my personal approach to business deals handling employees dealing with various professionals from a subservient positioneven dealing with pushy doctors and controlling ex spouses
Sun Tzu is about LIFE
Because like it or not life isnt fair it isnt always fun and some timesyou need to be able to be assertive without being aggressive and you have to be willing to be adversarial to get what you need
This is a worthwhile read for ANYONEboth from an advice and tactics point of view AND for the clarity of style turn of phrase and excellent use of metaphor
I have yet to run into a BAD translation of Tzu and this one was no exception.
This is considered a long time classic
 Rightfully so
 It is a book with many interpretations and you will take away the ones you see as useful to your situation
 That being said more of the concepts may apply
 Sun Tzu wrote this book about matters he considered serious so even being a short book by todays standards it applies to important matters it is read and studied a most major military higher training facilities the world over
 The applications are not just military but can be applied to any situation where there is a conflict between two entities.
I downloaded this book for my son
 He is a gamer
 He thought it would help him and he is constantly testing lessons learned
 I think this is an awesome book for kids that cant stay away from a gaming console for more than a few minutes
 I wish there were more books that could get my kids to read voluntarily.
My bad for not reading the description..
this thing is just a little pamphlet buddy to the actual real version that i see that i still need to buy..
 for this...not even worth the price of return shipping.lol
whatever...
I like the thin profile of this book its got nice thicker pages and doesnt get all bent up in the corners
The content is legendary and will give you insight to anything you do in life work or play.
Cheap and quick in its arrival
Now for the book you should read it as there is some advice that applies to everyone even if they arent competing or going to war.
A book of war strategy  The Art of War which was written in China  years ago by the Chinese General SUN TZU
I was introduced to this book in martial arts studies and later was again introduced to the book in business as a tool for planning business strategy
Examples Know the Enemy This is the first of SUN TZUs rules for successful warfare
Know Yourself The second part of SUN TZUs rule is to know yourself strengths and weaknesses Presented this book to business friends and martial artist
Have two hardback and this Kindle Copy enjoy......cas
Should have seen the number of pages mentioned in the description
 Its not a full book  its a summary
 How deceptive
I should have read the reviews before I got this
I am the only one to blame
Dont buy this expecting the big book

This short book takes a primer approach to being a general and leader in war
 I cant see how it would be an essential element of turning anyone into a successful general
 You can learn most of the basic lessons presented by Sun Tzu by playing war or cowboys  indians in the mountains of Pennsylvania
 If you had a deprived childhood your Mom  Dad kept guns away from you and did not allow you to play violent childhood games I recommend you read the book and pay attention to basic tactics and the value of planning and using all available resources
 Because it is short and instructional it should be a quick read and worth your time even if you read it only to satisfy your curiosity
 I was a bit disappointed given the hype of the book
 The general repeats himself and often makes a big deal of the obvious
If you want to become the next General Macarthur or General Patton make better use of your time and look elsewhere
 If you think there is a need for another Napolean type then maybe this would be a good start
 If you are still curious have the time  a couple of bucks buy it and read it.
I shouldve read product description before buying I wouldve found that the book here is  pages and just a gist of the original wouldnt recommend buying
This book is a good tool for former and present leaders
No matter the environment whether in a business or any other functional set up like hospitals profit and non profit organizations private or public industry war is everywhere and is always restless.
The ideas presented in Sun Tzus Art of War are still applicable to the st century
 Reading Sun Tzus words can open your mind to what life presents to us on a daily basis
 Taking that statement one step further  we have to become cognizant to our surroundings
environment and the people in our circle of friends or colleagues at work
 Rereading the Art of War will give you a deeper insight and understanding of the meaning behind the words
 Once you open yourself  many things only become clear
 You might say  food for thought.
Great book  however the formatting of this version is terrible
 The first  pages are unorganized and poorly written analyses of the art of War
 Moreover this version is devoid of the fancy bells and whistles features in other ebooks such as a table of contents hyperlinks  etc
If youd like to get to the actual Sun Tzu text open this ebook and do a search on your kindle for I
 Laying  without the quotation marks
Other than the aforementioned problems this is an exact replica of the Giles translation of the art of War
you get what you pay for
Because of the illustrations I downloaded The Art of War to the Kindle Fire HD
 Quite pleased with the presentation and the formatting
As for the text of the book itself there is little that can be said that has not been said
 This is a must read book for everyone and I especially recommend it for late teens or college students
 Although Sun Tzu was actually describing war this book is easily understood in terms of life in general and great for business majors.
If you are in politics business or the military you will find the thoughts of General Sun Tzu quite enlightening and useful in strategy and tactics
 The unfortunate thing for military folks is that civilians and generals in a building thousands of miles away from the danger have far too much say in the actions on the battlefield and reveal that they obviously have no knowledge of General Tzus teachings which if employed could save lives and shorten wars
A quick and easy read at a reasonable price.
I was glad to finally read this book however I was burdened with so much history and backstory as to who Sunzi was if in fact he existed
 There seemed to be about  of the book in setting up of who Sunzi was before we read his first line of teachings
It is great to read his teachings but all the setup seems unnecessary and somewhat irritating
 I already had a pretty good idea about Sunzi and strictly wanted to read his teachings
 I think in short his teachings could be written in a handful of pages and one could interpret from there but that is not the case with this version
I would still recommend this friends and family but it would come with a strong warning about the setup and the seemingly constant commentary which distracted me from really enjoying his teachings.
So..
Just so you know
Remember anyone can review any product on Amazon and for the most part few actually review the product itself
This particular eBook is thick with indepth information on Art of War and its author
It takes about  chapters to even begin to reach the chapter
First a discussion of Sun Tsus existence then of the books existence then of the  critics that will be interjected as you read the book
And the interjections dont wait till the end or are footnoted theyre put wherever and however long need be
Its not bad in fact its really informative but I just wanted the  chapters
If you think youd be apply to just push through the square bracket passages be ready for a real challenge
Id want to rate it  to offset the other ratings but this edition isnt that bad just not what was expected.
I took the course a long time ago
 This is THE BEST synopsis I have come across
 If you study this little book it will open almost any door for you and allow you to WIN easily
 It may be applied to business sports and personally if you follow the principles set forth in this easy to read and understand strategy.
Reads like a long series of sometimes insightful and sequential topically organized fortune cookies on the art of war
Still going thru it
Not exactly a book you cant put down.
Easy to read Great content Highly recommended
Can use these strategies at modern workplaces
This is the book people leaving the comfort of home to go into the real world
 This book is where military and industry management education begins the world over
Redundant but also if you read about the time frame and the history of that part of the world you will see how well the idea works
This book illustrates how going forward is done if getting the job done is all that matters
 If you also read books on world leaders and military leaders you will see how they applied the process.
the book was in good condition and a nice price to boot
it came in a timely fashion as well
Didnt realize it came in two books
No big deal at all
The narration for Sun Tzus Art of War by Tantor Abridged is excellent
It does more than justice to the original novel and even provides side notes of interesting commentary by other historically significant characters generals warlords and others who have noted on the word of Sun Tzu and even accounts of real battle applications
Definitely worth the price
I enjoyed every minute of this work and even as a lessthanavid reader it was a very enjoyable experience.
Not the full length book
This shouldnt have 
stars at all
Its amazing to think that someone so long ago without the access to study legions of greats before him could have so many practical ideas that would truly stand the test of time referring to the fact that he would become one of the greats and was born before major peers in Europe or elsewhere would even be born
What some say about being able to use his ideas in other areas like business is a legitimate claim as the ideas are about beating an enemy not specifically about how to win a war on th  battlefield
Mustread for any student of history military or otherwise and those in the business world wanting to learn a couple tricks to get a legup.
thought I was getting the Thomas Cleary Edition
 Nope
 Not happy.
The book Art of War written by Sun Tzu is military treasure trove of military tactics
 This is a stunning display of  chapters that were written over  years
 The chapters in this book describe one of the worlds greatest generals philosophy on war and strategy
The book discusses different ways to command troops and the pitfalls associated with war
 Sun Tsu states that the faster your troops move the more troops are lost in the process
 The authors philosophy here is to show that more careful planning to military strategy will save lives and hopefully achieve success on the battlefield
The Art of War can be applied to life in general and not just military tactics
 Taking ones time in planning will lead to less strife fewer problems and reaching ones goals
 This book is a great read for anyone interested in military strategy and philosophy
 I highly recommend it
this is a great handbook to own it will teach you the importance of how and when to fight your battles but more importantly..how to pick the ones you want to fight
you will know the difference
and if you follow these simple guidelines you will succeed.
This is a great book on Chinese history and the basic principles to the strategy of war
It is the words of the great general Sun Tzu from the Warring States Period in ancient China around b.c.
This is particular edition is very clear and precise however short
It is the bare basics and a great intro to other higher level editions as well as books on warfare
I would recommend reading every line over until you grasp what Sun Tzu was trying to say
I would also think it beneficial if you followed up reading a more through edition perhaps the  hard cover edition of The Illustrated Art of War by Samuel Griffith followed by The Art of Warfare by Sun Tzus descendant Sun Pin Sun Bin
In short this is a great easy to learn piece of Chinese literature that is a great intro to the philosophy of warfare which can be applied to everyday life and leadership.
Dont buy
Wish i read a single review before buying
Didnt think Id have to check the reviews to know if this was the right book
Cliff notes version but doesnt state that anywhere.
This crap is the equivalent to a high schooler book report based on a YouTube video of someone paraphrasing the book from memory
Amazon should be ashamed to sell this crap
And the cost to ship it back is more than I paid for it.
Sun Tzus maxims and insights are timeless
 Centuries after it was written The Art of War is required reading for warriors and still taught as part of the central curriculum at military academies around the world
 The insights are timeless on point focused and delivered with a nononsense clarity that translates to tactical and operational success
 It is a must read for any serious student of warfare and history for every soldier and for those that wish to understand them.
Looks and feels like a school notebook
Bad quality.
Good for a short version  Chapter  was missing from my copy.
This version is the  chapters without the lengthy introductions.
When you interpret what is said it all makes sense
I did a quick read and then went back and reread will be a great reference book
You could use the information in war or business its all in how you use it
Book looks cheaply made but it also is super cheap so no surprise there
Its free online I should have probably just done that.
Quality and translation are reasonable I think
Theres one chapter out of order which is certainly a mistake and weird but not super bad
No prologue no epilogue nothing but the main text and index
All in all for the  I paid for it pretty OK.
This book contains only Sun Tzus original thoughts on war and does not have any comentary added about his observations
 It does not paraphrase or compare it to business models or any other inspirational theme
 I enjoyed the plain information and reading this mans observations and deductions about how to win a war was very interesting and gave me lots of insights into humans and war
Quite recommended just for the concepts provided.
A great reference book Would recommend.
A book everyone must read at least once in their life
A great teaching of life business and self.
There are works that you must read or cannot consider yourself as educated
 this is one of those authors who has been translated many times into almost every language so weather this translation or others the author Sun Tzu or Sunzi however you pronounce the ideogram  produced in a few chapters one of the seminal works on conflict and one of the oldest works on the subject that is as relevant today as it was when it was written.
Normal Quality for paperback
I would recommend to purchase Art of War with experts comments on them
this book is a steal i dont care about the negative reviews talking about editions and nitpicking and what not this is a great price and also the best looking cover to any art of war book out there simplistic and impacting very appealing and at a very veryyy affordable price i havent read it yet but i know what to expect i suggest buying it you really have nothing to lose
This is only the summary not the actual book.
Appears to be the same version that appears under multiple different entries when you search for The Art of War on Amazon
Doesnt appear to be full text and there are noticeable typos note heading numbered   under Laying Plans  if you scroll through youll see this in numerous versions of the book on the Amazon results.
The book is solid
I can see why so many people recommend reading it
There are a lot of basic points but it is nice to see from such a point of view
I received and read this book all in one day
It is not very long.
This is my first time purchasing The Art of War by Sun Tzu but realize now that I should have read the reviews first  Great price but wasnt expecting Cliff notes version of the book
 On the flip side of that I cant say Im terribly dissatisfied because Im sure Ill enjoy the knowledge it offers
 Although next time Ill be sure to read reviews first
While this book deals with the subject of war it may be aplicable to daily life and business
Of course with regard to life and business the goal must be to prevail without brutality and killing
This book also showes that war should always be a last option because once engaged it must be fought with all the brutality man can concieve
Simply put dont go to war unless you mean to prevail
If you engage you must be prepaired to do all that is necessary to win
A must read for our polititians Not an easy read.
The Art of War is a compendium of the military experience and wisdom of Sun Tzu which is an honorific given to the author Sun Wu
It was written over two millennium ago
Naturally there are varying theories and disputes as to who actually wrote it and which version is correct
There is also the matter of the proper translation
The one I read was translated by Lionel Giles in 
It is one of the most if not the most influential text on military strategy and tactics
Mao Zedong Vo Nguyen Giap and Douglas MacArthur are only three of the many military leaders who credit the importance of Sun Tzu work in guiding their thinking
It remains an essential textbook at the military colleges in the United States and is also required reading in the CIA
I finally decided to read this classic in search of a specific quote that I had been told was from Sun Tzus work and which I had had some personal experience with Never fight on a battlefield that resembles an inverted tortoise shell
 I didnt find the quote but perhaps I found the opposite
At least the tortoise shell reference SOUNDS like something he might have said
The author did grab my attention with an anecdote in the introduction which underscored one of his aphorisms If words of command are not clear and distinct if orders are not thoroughly understood the general is to blame
But if his orders are clear and the soldiers nevertheless disobey then it is the fault of their officers
In the anecdote it is women who are divided into two sides each led by one of the emperors favorite concubines
Because they could not maintain proper discipline among their troops each of the concubines is beheaded despite the protests of the emperor
It should be no surprise that their replacements achieved perfect discipline within the ranks and Sun Tzu who proclaimed the army ready had the temerity to rebuke the emperor with The King is only fond of words and cannot translate them into deeds
How often such a speaker in the real world can keep his own head is not discussed in the text
There is much wisdom in this text
For example All warfare is based on deception
There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare
On a good leader Hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilize combined energy
And one that Vo Nguyen Giap must have taken to heart Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances
that is he did not repeat the tactics that led to victory at Dien Binh Phu by repeating them at Khe Sanh instead he went for Saigon and the American public via television As for that inverted tortoise shell the one passage that seemed closest to addressing this issue seemed to imply the opposite Pass quickly over mountains and keep in the neighborhood of valleys
And Camp in high places facing the sun
Do not climb heights in order to fight
So much for mountain warfare
Certainly Giap seemed to have disregarded that one
And there seems to be that classic problem of all too many holy books
There are passages that imply this and passages that imply the opposite of this
 For example on the allimportant matter of logistics and supply Sun Tzu says  Bring war material with you from home but forage on the enemy and Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy
One cartload of the enemys provisions is equivalent to twenty of ones own
 But on the other hand We may take it then that an army without its baggagetrain is lost without provisions it is lost without bases of supply it is lost
There is much good advice that seems to be routinely ignored despite its place in the curriculum such as the emphasis on short decisive wars and the repeated admonitions to know the enemy
Conversely there are the passages that can be chosen to buttress one argument and others to buttress the counterargument
Overall stars.
This is not what you are looking for
 total pages More akin to a booklet youre better off finding a free pdf version than paying money for this overblown brochure
This book is an easy read for me and the book is very interesting.
Seriously simple read that will help you whether the need arises to lay siege to a walled city or the normal day to day confrontations we all have
 Its really a book of proverbs on who is likely to win a battle and why
 Whatever those battles are.
Only a  start because the book looks bigger in the pictures lol but meh its nice
This is more a historians review of various works related to Sunzi
The first few parts are interesting while latter parts of the book goes flat latter on with lines of wisdom wit and paragraphs trying to give meaning and intelligence to those lines.
If you are in to this type of book..
highly recommended Shipped and received quickly too.
I got this for my husband and he really enjoyed reading it
It is exactly what the title says it is
Its a classic and that is why my husband wanted it
The price on this book is great
It a nice binding for as inexpensive as it is
If you are looking for a short classic about ancient war strategies this book will fit that need.
A terrible condensed version
It reads like a college students study notes.
This book is a fine distillation of skill gleaned from vast experience on the field of battle
Much of the instruction revolves around actually avoiding battle and the carnage of war
It has become an inspiration and map for building strategy in managing people
It seems to me when words passed down through many generations remain relevant those words have attained greatness.
words to live by in this cut throat corporate world as well as every day dealings with the people around usNever be taken advantage ofAlways have the upper handbe in a position of command  control
General Sun Tzu is a visionary way ahead of his time 
Sun Tzu and The Art of War is a must read for any person who battles
If you know someone you call friend who has not read The Art of War
it is your duty to get them a copy of the book
There is more to a fight than the fist or weapon
It all starts in the mind of one or more beings
An ancient lesson uncontrolled anger against a real or imagined enemy is what will destroy us long before the foe.
Its an abridged version
Not the full length book
Nothing in the description says this is a short summary of the actual book
Very disappointed
Short about  pages  with various saying from sun tzu
This is not the book
I thought it was the book.
Worked as a gag gift for a friend but wasnt nearly the whole works of the Art of War
Dont buy this.
The translation in this copy is awful but shame on me for purchasing a  copy
There are instances when the publisher fails to translate the Chinese and instead includes the phonetic spelling of the Chinese character
I think that ought to give you a flavor for how this reads
Terrible.
This is easily the best book on strategy and war that I have
 The format is good enough for me
 A must have in every collection.
Great read i enjoyed this book
Shipped quickly and arrived in perfect shape.
One of the best books for anyone to read for almost any reason
The Art of War has many teachings and life lessons for every single person that only can aid in your journey through life.
This is a great pocket version of The Art of War there are no notes or additional interpretations so it is not a scholarly study of the text it is simply Sun Tzus words in one compact document.
I have listened to this book on audible but I did purchase this book just for reference
This book is a powerful book
We as humans have been killing each other for centuries..
The author just refined the process of how to best do it in his time..
Well done.
Arrived on time in perfect condition
I only gave the product four stars because its a very thin book in person
I always thought that it was thicker like a novel
This version is quite thin and seems like a book of lists of Sun Tzus teachings
I bought this book so I could have a copy of my own even though my dad has one
His is much more novellike
Maybe one is revised or rewritten or something but I wish I knew if this one is truly authentic not revised.
One of the classic treatises on managing ultimate human conflict
You dont read this for entertainment
But if you are in any way involved in a battleground whether its on a real battlefield with real weapons or in an office with only words and deeds as your weapons youll learn more about how to prevail.
This is someones interoperation  of the text I wanted a Complete translation DELETED from Kindle
I think everyone in general should read this book
Great book for understanding war strategy and can definitely be applied to everyday life.
I had heard of the book for decades but as part of a political strategy group was required to read it
 While I strongly believe in the virtues and power of Love and Forgiveness in nearly every endeavour it is important to know whom you may be working for or against
 In politics being prepared and understanding your opponents weaknesses is vital
 This is a short book and packed with wisdom.
Whether you like learning or prepping for the end of days this book is a treasure worthy sharing through the ages.
Good product.
Read this book and it changed my live in  Bought it because I read it from the Library Taoism and eastern philosophy has the greatest approach to the battle within
It would be foolish for someone to claim superior knowledge over the author of this treatise of tactics and wisdom in the Art of War
Sun Tsu has been studied for centuries now and to date there has been no one that has been able to best perhaps the move brilliant tactician of all time
Though the book is relatively short within its pages is a treasure trove of knowledge IF the reader can and will apply the lessons of this Master of all things War.
This guy was light years ahead of his time
His battles depended on mostly tactics based on what the weather conditions were and what form of territory and environment youre in and to ration your armys energy during a battle and when to fight and when not to
 Its a damn good thing that Hitler didnt do his homework on this
And basically show that the rules of war is was and always will be BS
His tactics are still put to good use even to this very day thou its original intention was for future wars but its put into practice for other means
For instance football coaches company managers even the great Bobby Fisher took a  few tips from this guys book
So in retrospect technology and engineering may have completely obliterated the dynamics of the rules of war but the art is still the same.
While this is a treaties and not a novel like the Amazon prompts treats it it should be said that Sunzi or Tsun Zu depending on the translation is an extremely complex and pragmatic writer
His views on war influenced all the great leaders of the last  years and I would wager that it would be the last  years but I couldnt prove it.
This book has been around for  years
Its on everybodys Must Read list.
How about putting in the details thats its not the full text
What a scam.
A classic of strategy for approaching difficult decisions
Also helps explain some parts of Chinese thinking of strategy.
Not the full length
I like it straight to the point
It explains the aspects of war and how to apply tactics Some information can be applied to everyday life.
Wonderful book
Clean covert
Came quickly with no issues
Highly recommend this read
It was a dollar
Why not
A classic to read cheap to pick up and printed nicely in this book.
I read this over the weekend and I found it very though provoking
Several of the laws made me think about current affairs
Perhaps our leaders should read it.
I liked this book must read
Must read
Its helped me in my profesional life a lot.
When I first sought out this book I did so because it seems to be everywhere
Everyone seems to have either read it or knows someone very close who has
It is in several movies and television shows the list goes on
So I told myself I need to read this just to see what it is and when it arrived I was surprised
The book is incredibly smaller than I would have ever predicted but this is not to say it is void of content
It seems to me to have been written in such a way as to avoid any irrelevant information
Without quoting or divulging its secrets The Art of War is a unique tool for looking into the strategic mind of the past and for improvingrefiningsolidifying your own theory.
This book is a treasure Everyone should read it
Mostly common sense but still worth the read
Excellent book if you like poignant summaries from one of the worlds greatest tacticians
I gave it to my son for his th birthday and he loves it.
Best book out there for your private and professional life.I cannot  be as ruthless but I can spot a ruthless person
 this book taght me how to deal with them and not become one of them
 A must read for any female
I purchased this book because I wore out my st one
Love the book.
Good Book
The book is smaller than I expected in that it feels like a childrens book in my hands
 Its well made but if youre expecting a full size book dont order this one
Interesting book
I know its a classic and wanted to find out what made it such
A lot of sound basic commonsense ideas about how a war should be fought but overall it wasnt the inspiration I expected
But worth a read.
Read for the th time
Sun Tzus Art of War is one of those worlds finest classic literatures that marks and influences those who will challenge themselves to read this military treatise
It discusses tactics and strategies in military affairs that are implicitly related and indirectly applied to the fields of business affairs human psychology management ancient history military sciences politics anatomy of organizations in conflicts and the likes
Classics remain classics not because they were written in the ancient times they were called classics because they continue to have meanings  different meanings when read in different circumstances and moods
They become more useful as we use them therefore we grow wiser with them
Understanding Sun Tzus treatise is understanding ancient methods of resolving conflicts handling battles and hailing to the great spiritual tradition of Taoism.
Every survival expert and survivalist should have a copy of this book in their bunker
The principals of supply transportation and victory are contained in the pages of this book
 While translated to modern language the essence is clear that the Art of War is an old profession but if followed and adhered to will allow anyone the chance for final victory.
Easy read for history and military people
Dont waste your time buying this you wont find much thats relevant for today
 Even if you are a military person the info in this is for centuries gone by.
A must read for anyone interested in warfare and how it is waged
 How battles are won and lost
 Highlights the importance of intelligence
 What Sunzi wrote so long ago holds true for todays warriors.
Great new
the bible of war
literally
theres the bible a treatise on which the foundations of mans quest for faith is built and the art of war the manual for defeating your enemy yet securing your place at Gods feet as the meek who will inherit the earth
Defeating your enemy before the battle ensues and is so much applicable today as it was  years ago when it was written  i might be off by a year or 
So this is more like a notes book not the actual book
Has a good summary of your trying to write a paper
Maybe I didnt read the discription correctly.
Exactly what it says it is.
Tons of important typos and poor translations
Quick read its great
Confusing does not appear to be the full version.
I got this in great condition
I enjoyed reading this and learning about how significant this writing has been in ancient times and in modern times
I had this delivered in a timely manner too.
This book was recommended to me by none other than Greg Berhrendt via his former podcast Walking The Room
I love it so much Its so different than what I was expecting in a great way Thanks Greg
I was wondering what the BIG DEAL of this book was
Many business people have read it and address it as a business book
I found it free on amazon and of course I downloaded it
Boy Am I glad I did
The beginning was a bit scary for me
Let me not spoil it for you but if you read it you will understand why
For those on business get this right if the vision and mission of the organization are clear but the members or employees are not acting accordingly the leadership is to blame and MUST be FIRED or maybe worse...
I very much loved the transcriptions of Sun Tzu and the design of the book and format was appealing
However there were some translation issues which were mildly excusable and expected but there were also some punctuation issues
This is a very fascinating read and the few flaws this version has are excusable for the cheap price of ..
Ill start off by saying that this Kindle version has quite a few typos which is the only reason I granted it  stars
The book itself however deserves  stars
Although it was written for an entirely different era its still modernly applicable in the art of strategic thinking
In addition being someone who is fond of lists I loved the writing style of the book
It was short sweet and didnt waste any time getting right to the point.
Theres like s of editions of the Art of War  Its difficult to figure out which ones are legit
 My particular edition yellow book with red and black yin yang was one of the fakes.
This book rips.
Nowhere does it say its the footnotes version of the book
Its condensed down to  pages of proverbs with context taken out.
Iwas a little disappointed when I opened this book
This is not one of the better published translations that are available however taking into account the purchase price I will just add it to my library as a variant copy.
The product description is misleading as it doesnt mention that this isnt the ACTUAL book
This version does not contain full text
Look elsewhere if you want to purchase The Art of War
It was my mistake for not being more wary of the low price and not looking into the page count.
Misspelled words grammatical errors and difficult layout  abound in the kindle edition
 Very distracting.
If you never read another book read this
This is a classic book that I heard about and wanted to read
 Its a very interesting book with interesting principles and strategies.
Great
The book is short but interesting
Its written in the style of bullet points
Its not hugely practical for todays times but it is very interesting to see the wisdom of someone from  years ago and the guidance they gave to deal with war in their time.
There is so much interesting information in this small book and it is such a good guide to strategy
The strategies can be extrapolated to help in problemsolving although we are not always at war of course
It is a great thoughtprovoking text for dealing with difficult situations and finding outofthebox solutions
It encourages creative solutions.
This is a wonderful book it is about so much more than war...its really about life and people
I highly recommend it to anyone that deals with people that want a new understanding of the world and how people fit within it.
Having heard so much about Sun Tzu and his wisdom I was prepared for something much better
 His writing might impress someone with no experience in the field but for those who have a general knowledge of the outdoors and warfare it is not very enlightening
What makes it particularly disappointing to me is the fact that he contradicts himself so many times
 It would seem that the whole idea is to impress people with his wisdom rather than actually impart anything of any real value
There is some good advice but nothing that is much above the common sense of an American Eagle Scout and most of the successes are simply the result of deception and ruthlessness
Something that is repeated several times is the fact that trying to fight a war in faraway places can be very expensive and difficult
 Considering the fiascoes of Korea and Vietnam we should already know this by bitter experience  So other than a few examples of deception and trickery I really did not see a lot of military expertise in his accomplishments
One of the things that I disliked the most about the book was that it is printed in a font so small that it is very hard on the eyes
 All in all I dont feel the book was worth the small price I paid for it.
A concise book filled with timeless insight regarding both war and life.
Its only around  pages
It doesnt indicate that anywhere
Dont buying you want the full version.
Always...
Wtf Short version summary
nowhere in the description does it say its a cliff note of the actual book.
Great accompaniment when learning to play chess.
The Art of WAR IS A QUICK READ BUT A MORE DIFFICULT STUDY
MY GOAL WAS TO FIND PARALLELS IN THE BOOK THAT I COULD RELATE TO BUSINESS AND PLEASURE
I FIND MYSELF REREADING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TO SEE IF THERE IS A STRATEGY TO A CURRENT LIFE CHALLENGE
SOMETIMES THERE IS MORE OFTEN I DO NOT FIND THE STRATEGY
THAT IS WHEN I USE TRUE LIFE EXPERIENCES
I WILL MOST LIKELY READ IT SEVER MORE TIMES DURING THE COMING YEAR.
Love it
book
This book is one that you read over and over
 Always some new comes to light as you reread
 Should be on a need to read list at college level and a must for all military people.
first off
it is VERY thin and not a long read
its not quite the philosophical masterpiece i thought it would be
it was still an interesting read with SOME interesting points
i believe that Sun Tzus views are more mainstream in asia but to mean american they didnt quite click
Buy it if you would like to see different view points of a collectivist culture it was an interesting read.
An interesting read.
Great price and a perfect stocking stuffer
Its one of those books you have to read
Sure its been summarized a thousand times interpreted in a thousand ways and twisted around in quotes forever but its one of those things that until youve read it it just doesnt come together like it should
Read it and maybe youll learn something about yourself.
I have always enjoyed this reading.
This version is cheap for a reason
More like a summary of the original but not at all what I was looking for
Maybe it is good as a summary but as the whole thing and a beautiful edition to a collection it fails entirely.
price attractive but no translator specified nor any info beyond the text itself.
You will be surprised how much pure horse crap youll begin seeing in people once youve read this book
Essential tool for life especially in the workplace.
This book looks like someone printed it at home
And maybe they did
The cover is blurredpixelated so it looks like someone stretched out a lowres image and sent it through their inkjet
Theres no publisher information inside either
Anyway nice simplified version of The Art of War if thats what youre looking for.
This version is trash.
Some of the principles were solid and others were a bit over the top
A decent read nonetheless though.
Just my curious about china.
This is a low quality EXTREMELY abridged version with so few pages I probably could have written it myself in  hours
Youd think if theyre advertising a wellknown book but selling a version with only  of the content that theyd at least make an ATTEMPT at mentioning that.
Deceptice sales tactics
Do not buy this
This is barley a cliff note version of a long and profound book
Very disappointed
I DO NOT RECOMMEND
Like most of the other reviewers this book is a condensed version of the original book
I am highly disappointed and will be returning immediately where upon I will purchase the original version.
Book was new and as advertised.
Very handy book when needed...perfect condition.
Good short and sweet no bull no nonsense blah blah
just the facts
Easy to remember rather than the other versions I have owned
Those had too much comments from translators and they put thier own twist on what Sun Tsu meant
This version gets to the point not meant for the scholar meant for regular guys like me.
Already a classic hit for this ancient war strategy book that still benefit this generation Adians voice was perfect narrative to explain and follow the cunning nation of war its strategy and how a commander or ruler should view the art of the craft
Already loving his performance as Littlefinger in Game of Thrones this version of the Art of War became one of my obsessed possession to listen over and over while getting deeply educated about this ancient strategy Highly highly recommended for anyone who is GOT fan to get a copy A Must have
Thank you so much love it awsome condition
Always my favourite interpretation of Sun Tzus Art of War
Most interpretation I have read are dry and dull to read
James Clavel captures the spirit and intent of Sun Tzus masterpiece of strategy.
Handy book if your looking to improve leader skills in the job place
Good knowledge to have too
I can not speak intelligently about the quality of this translation
 Given the accuracy of translation  I found that this was a brilliant summary of tactics used in ground warfare in China several thousand years ago
 Still poignant today across battlefields
 It does not of course include analysis of naval and air and ground technological advances
 Excellent reading and it comes highly recommended.
A classic that relates as much to business negotiating planning as to its original subject of war.
 Review of the unabridged and unannotated Cleary translation pp
Likely revolutionary when it was first written the wisdom contained in this book is now old hat common sense
The parts directly applicable to war with few exceptions such as know thy enemy and know thyself and fear no defeat are exclusively applicable to st generation warfare fought with sword horse bow and static fortifications though a few pages give a prcis of what should be expected of an officer corps and disciplined army which are applicable to any multitier centralized organization
The rest of the book is taken up with descriptions of terrain types etc
with no modern practical nor metaphorical application that I could discern
I wonder how many generals got their men slaughtered because they read this book and thought they understood war
Likely more than the mandarin system advanced to high government post on stylized understanding of the five classics and their commentaries
Of the muchpraised business strategy or general strategy or the art of war as life I read little.
During the s in the wake of Reagan economics and greed on Wall Street every tycoon wannabe read this book as a text for making money
 That isnt why Sun Zi wrote it
 He wrote it as a primary text for wannabe generals and military tacticians
 I suspect Erwin Rommel read it the Desert Fox who kept the British Army at bay during his Afrika Campaign
 Written in the typical style of Chinese short and succinct it is a very great look at military tactics.
One of my favorite books
I had to read this
This book has been the basis for war strategy for centuries
Its very interesting short yet involved
Its translated so its a bit rough in vernacular but I would recommend this book for anyone that is in a cutthroat business the military or anyone looking to learn the strategy of defeating an opponent
You should read this if you havent
This book is so important to the history of the world.
I GAVE ONE TO EACH OF ALL MY GRANDCHILDREN.
A great short read the laws can be applied to not only warfare but everyday life and any problems that may arise.
This book is not a promotion of violence but is intended to help one gain an understanding of tactics and battle strategy
This english translation is very detailed and when displayed on Kindle unknown words are defined and easily understood
Also transferrable to other devices when using an appropriate Kindle App.
Paperback copy
its a short description of a life of under expectations if you want to be under the influence of one teacher
Sun
If there are many levels which cant inform you to identify a level of victory.
The print was really small and it doesnt look like the original book pagination wise I believe this is some kind of reprint.
Nice and compatible.
Quick to read and gives tons of ideas in any way shape or form
I used it to expand my strategies in business and it gave me so many ideas as to how to take down competition and win over others business
Nothing but excellence can come from this book
Good book
Read a interpretation of this  the uninterpretated version is a little more intresting and fun to read.
Good book
This is not the full version of the book bit instead a cliff note or quick version
great for someone that needs a fast read for a paper or assignment but not for those that want to read the actual book.
Wasnt that interesting
The content was good but overall wouldnt recommend
It seems like a lot of the information was outdated because the book references chariots and older methods of warfare
I would suggest thinking about the concepts in terms of modern warfare.
This is not the actual book but rather a version of the book broken down
I was looking for the original and this is not it description is misleading
It works if you want a summary
This is a wonderful book my son wants to be in the military and it helped him think about how they think about war
He had a hard time with the concepts at first but once he found the underlying meaning
he was able to read it with a breeze.
Classic book on thoughtful approach to life
Not the full book
added to library
Perfect
Interesting tips for war
The old language was a little boring may be because English is not my native language.
Dont buy not the full book.
Versus the Art of Peace
Good advice that is useful when enacting revenge upon others or even driving down the highways.
Great book to read
A must to over come adversity in your life
Teaching you planning and how to win
Great for sports professional life as well as personal.
Good book
Not archival quality.
Good book
Dont let the title deceive you
This book is not only for warfare on the battlefield but in your life
In some ways a fighting mans Tao Te Ching
Sunzus classic prepares you for dealing with the cruel and duplicitous
I have read the book in Chinese and English and can confirm this is an excellent translation
Its funny how business people use the book when really they are just exercising their greed
The book is not about stealing but about gaining an advantage but always for the purpose of good and benefit of all
Over and over Sunzi discusses how the leader must consider their subordinates to achieve success
The story will remain useful throughout time.
Not the right Art of War
I was hoping it was the complete book.
Great
All members of the military and politicalwar theorists need to read this
Its a classic that introduces timeless concepts for how to wage war
Its up there with Carl von Clausewitzs On War in the annals of military theory writing.
Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese philosopher most of his sayings are still relevant to this day and age regarding business and warfare
I wish I can find my copy but it got lost in the midst of my stuff and probably thrown away since the book is very small
I might buy a second copy when I move out within two months so I can read it .
Though it may be the quintessential book for the military student and solider its relevance can not be ignored
This book was written so long ago and in a language so difficult to translate its almost impossible to fully understand
That being said this version is very well done
The translations are done without embellishment with the commentary following each chapter
The basic principals of displine organization proper planing intellengace and even misdirection can be applied in may different fields of work
I highly recommend this book as an addition to anyones personal library
You dont have to be a West Point cadet.
i love the way james clavell simplifies this very important book
This book is a must read on strategy for anything competition related.
As the title says this book and the ideas therein have truly stood the test of time
In any conflict this book can aide you
Ive even taken advice from this book and applied it in strategy games to much success
The concepts presented are flawless logically speaking and the book itself is well laid out.
Thank u
small but efficient
Way ahead of its time
Tactics have changed but the psychology of warfare is still the same
Must read for  the military.
While this is an interesting book this edition is shoddily copyedited
There are lots of typographical errors
You can read it for content but Im a stickler for books using proper spellings so if I were to purchase again Id look for a cleaner edition.
Great book everyone needs to read
Rip off This isnt the entire book
Buyer beware I was really excited to read this until it arrived and I realized that this is a shortened version of the actual book.
thought i was buying the book but this is like a little summary pamplet very unhappy
It is very good and most of the principals hold true to today.
The book is a classic so theres no comment on it you should read other great reviews
But the edition is terrible
It even has the chapters in the wrong order I mean it was  dollars not  cents
Has some really good advice that is generally limited to warcombat but not much else
 As a combat veteran I found it interesting especially after having to work under senior officers for four years as a USAF pilot
Most couldnt find their butt with four hands.
A classic but too basic if you have experience in military combat
 Very short book you can finish it in a couple of hours
 A lot of stuff in this book is great for boxers to read
 More useful for training boxers than for modern military combat
 However this is a very famous book.
This is a quick read but the content is simple without much development
The basic ideas are clear but the reasoning is not.
A book everyone should read takes you to another way to look at life work and every thing in between
Written in a way that can be understand but takes a higher mind to really allow it to sink in
If you have an afternoon go through it and take it in youll look at the world in a different light and maybe you might even realize that you know a lot of this already but be open minded and take in everything it says  because The Art of War is something else I highly recommend it one of my favorites fast shipping 
The Art of War is a book of knowledge the kind of knowledge that is timeless and a lifelong benefit to have learned
 If you havent read this book and learned its teachings then you should and if you have read this book but not learned any life lessons then you need to go back and read it again until you grasp the knowledge you are holding in your hands.
Very important literature for these times  The true nature of mans Warfare.
I think a lot of people should read this book
Yeah it is a book about military strategy and most people dont need to know that or will ever need to know that
However there is more to this book than meets the eye
This book also holds strategy one can use with interpersonal conflicts business and life in general
Simple ideas like flexibility being prepared and planning are all discussed in this book
I recommend it.
What can I say Classic read
This has been used by corporate employees and managers to get a leg up on the competition through strategies of contention confrontation empowerment and going for the kill
Recommend if you just want to learn battle strategies and applying their context into real world scenarios.
A large portion of the book is outdated
That being said there are tidbits of timeless information related to watergate competition and reflection.
Great read
I took the Great Courses course on The Art of War which inspired me to get the book
After reading the book I went through the Great Courses again.
A lot of interesting ideas are in this book
However it is a little difficult to grasp the ideas and apply it to todays world without rereading the book multiple times thinking about it and discussing your ideas with others.
Stewie Griffin was my inspiration to read this when I saw it was free for the kindle
 I have no knowledge of how good the translation is the formatting was tolerable and there were likely some typos
 All in all I thought it was a great read and several of his statements can be considered by modern day man in everyday dealings with people
A great read and not too long
 The commentary was interesting as well perhaps a bit sparse but useful.
I loved it Almost all of it is still relevant and applicable to the modern day Its a must read
Learn from this book
There is much wisdom inside
This quick read is about mobilizing troops effectively but anyone in a leadership role should read this to more effectively command the respect of the people who report to himher which will in term make them more loyal and a stronger team.
The book is a good read but I prefer the original book this one is more like a quick run down of the important points of the original book
Good reading
Made me think of being out there on a march way back in the days of hand weapons
Some good things apply to modern times
One I notice is when the men are dissatisfied they go and whisper together in small groups
Probably plenty more
Probably read it again
Goes along with Journey to the West in that way.
Good book
Much of these teachings can be applied to daily life
 They still teach this to cadets at military academies.
It would be nice if You tell people this is not the actual book its a summary if the book which in my opinion is pointless u less your in school and to lazy to read a  book
Flimsy book good subject matter
This book contains a collection of war proverbs
There is no explaining of the proverbs so if you want more depth you should spend more to get commentary included.
Ive heard many people recommend this book and yet it was not quite what I imagined it to be
Rather than a collection of lessons learned through the telling of historical events it is rather more like a list of proverbs by which a general should carry out the act of war
What struck me most was the admonition to disregard the orders of your superior should the information available to you contradict that which has been handed down
This understanding of personal autonomy is in my opinion the most important lesson given.
A cheap printing
I dont know what this is
I ordered a book to read and I feel what I got is someone saying here is whats in the book
Dont buy this crap
Spend a few more dollars and get a proper book with authentic publisher so u can really grasp what this book has to say.
The quality and feel of the binding is excellent especially for the price.
For those who wants to have a deeper understanding about war this ebook is suited for you because it has all the informations that will enable you to understand all the underlying principles about war
A wonderful and interesting read
Thanks for this
ok
Thanks to this baby I have everything I need to wage war on my opponents in the corporate jungle
That part about working around insurance rate changes PE ratios and how to slaughter the inflation effect on your bonds was stellar Thank you Sunzi  youve change my life.
This book is a good yet easy read
 Its easy to follow along with and the concepts in the book makes sense
 Apply this to modern day life and you can begin to build a strong mentality.
I had to read this because my students talked about it constantly
They believed that in the pages of the Art Of War were magic words to control and manipulate others
This book is very popular among the incarcerated
 The main difficulty they seen to have is the references to historical figures
I found the book interesting mainly because I love reading about history
Although i dont believe in book banning The art Of war along with a few other manipulation type books I personally feel should not be allowed in any jail or prison setting.
Great read in finding out some of the ins and outs of waging war
It seems practical and would likely require more study for one to be successful in this field.
Ok read
Small examples  Wasnt a fan
Only like  pages
Id pursue other versions.
Fantastic book great for military history buffs as well as people looking for a little advice on how to take control of your life and strategically plan the life ahead of you
I recommend this to many people and have personally given many copies as gifts.
These observations of human nature and the ways to accomplish your military aims are simple interesting and true
Human nature remains the same Amazingly this advice is completely applicable to everyday life especially in business relationships
This is one that reveals itself a little more with every reading.
Could use a little help with the translationsome simple little English mistakes in this version but the elements of the book came through and were clear and they are so so valuable even in just figuring out how to navigate the modern world  Great stuff
This is the cheapest quality book that I have ever seen
Disappointing.
My professor recommend me to read this book before start the class
So I just got my a book
If u want to learn about strategy try to read this book.
Do you want to get into the minds of commanders and generals of past and present THIS is the book you need
It was mandatory reading when I was in the Marines
The lessons and actions of troops has changed very little over the course of time
If you wonder why commanders do what they do please read this book.
Read it apply it metaphorically to your everyday life and DOMINATE
If you live a competitive lifestyle with an open mind that can bridge gaps...this book is for you...again....read it...and again...read it....again and again and again its a quick reads
The Art of War is one of those books that has wisdom for everybody regardless of their walk in life
While most of the information is directed at soldiers and generals and their behavior it contains insights that are applicable to dealing with coworkers bosses and strangers on the street.
great product
One of best books ever written for strategy construction for an ever growing number of applicable battlefields
  War is HELL..and has been for long before Sun Tzu..he was just the best at writing the best strategy down
  Take my Word please...this is always a good purchase.
This book applies to all that you do I truly like a few quotes I can use daily.
Ok
Classic
I have long been a fan of this book
Many years ago I was a tank officer in the US Army and believe me Sun Tzu knew what he wrote about
The language may seem stilted but the principles are clear
Some thing never change
The Easton edition is a superior translation and an elegant presentation
 I recommend it highly.
Not the full length book
Plan on reading it twice at the least
 There is allot in the text that needs to be mentally squeezed out.
Very interesting book that was very easy to read
Would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning ways to improve your life or someone who has interest in eastern philosophies.
Great product
I needed this for my son who has it as a set text in a Civics class
Its a perfectly decently made book at a price which makes it cheaper than printing out sections at home from public domain sources and its a lot easier to read this way too
Hey I may even borrow it back to improve my own education
Great
I thought I was buying the actual book  this is like a cliff notes version that I think I actually like better What it does is basically summarize main topics and breaks them down into a few quotes from the actual book that convey the meaning I was actually using this book to help my poker game and it worked
This is a short but detailed book
Pay attention and invite it into your life
This book is on the Must Read of all Military Colleges
 And that is through out the world
 It has been printed in every language known to man
 It is simple  It is direct
 It is how to win a war
 It may be a thousand years old but even with todays modern war machines still applies
 The only problem  And It Is A Big Problem............
 You are buying The Art of War Illustrated
 Problem  There is not one illustration in the entire Kindle edition
 Do yourself a favor  buy a paperback with the illustrations in them  They are important.
The Art of War takes the battle plans and uses psychological principles to win against any enemy
Written in simple descriptive language that anyone can read and apply to whatever adversarial situation presents itself
It can even be interpreted as a relationship guide The Art of War also states ways of fighting without having to fight at all
Brilliant and as relatable as it was when it was originally written
Everyone should have this book on their nightstand...next to their Bible
This book is full of knowledge that not only applies to war but also life
The lessons learned in this book can be allied to relationship friendship career and make you a more complete person in general
I recommend this book to be read by all those I care about becoming a better person.
Ancient wisdom carried down through time to our culture is found in this work
it is applicable to most walks of life particularly if one is in a position of authority over many persons and or required to intelligently utilize scarce resources
A fun book.
For us this is a reference book a code for life
Every time you read it you discover something new and useful
Nice slim sleek book
Very satisfied.
Its just a  summary of the book which could be useful but I thought I was getting the full book
I want my money back because it doesnt specify that its not actually the book.
Ive heard how this is a good book to read for examples of running a business
There are good points that can be extrapolated but you definitely need to read between the lines and look for the true meaning.
This was the fourth time I read The Art of War
I really love the book and strongly recommend it to anyone
Its truly one of the most timeless books there is and you can apply these principles whether youre a student businessman or anything else
However this edition is quite poor as theres a ton of mistakes wrong translations etc
Try to look for other possibilities how to read it theres dozens of versions of TAOW both on Kindle and on paper.
The book was in good condition
It was ordered as a replacement for one I loaned out and never got back thank you.
This is very misleading I was expecting the full book and it turned out to be a summary someones bullet notes
I feel cheated
Great read for anyone who may be interested in a stratagem for living a fulfilling and complete life
Must read Id you havent already or great piece for any collector
A
Simple statements that can be applied to life staegies
Well one cannot properly review at work this venerable its worth noting that Sun Tzus conceptions of nature natural law and human condition conform to much of later Western thought.
Sun Tzu is a genius and this book is a timeless classic
 When faced with a problem make sure your on the right side
 Then plan all your moves and take into account all possible outcomes
 Make sure your plan is foolproof then use your greatest strength against your problems weakest or key root issue
 Read the book for yourself and you will find that the book can be applied to a variety of situations from problem solving to sports to success in life
a great read
Who wouldnt love a copy of this classic
It wasnt the best..
the cover was pretty flimsy and almost ripped off in my bag
But the content is all good.
Received a shortened copy
Ended up going to bookstore to buy what I was looking for.
Not what i had expected at all
I had ordered it thinking that this was translated by Samuel B
Griffith and it is not
If you look inside the book it says Translated by Lionel Giles Dont let the ad fool you.
Did return it and I will be definitely looking closer at this the next time i buy a book.
Great read personally believe its a book everyone should read no matter how you feel about war
The book was good quality and I had no complaints about it.
Great book
The Art of War was shared with me by my Dad many years ago and I continue to find new bits of wisdom and perspective every time I read it
This book has helped guide my leadership decisions and has given confidence to my conflict resolution abilities
I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about leadership wisdom.
Summary
Not the real book.
This is a great cheap version of the book which should be a required reading
I loved it and Im sure you will too as it is written in bullet form since the statements are slightly complex and have deeper meaning.
Good deal for the price point.
Great Read valuable information and lessons applied to all aspects of life.
I like that everyone will take something different away from this book its timeless because of its truth you see the things he mentions everyday in people all these years later.
Friend enjoyed the book.
Not impressed thought I was buying a book that would last me more than a day of reading
It is more of a really condense version of a classic
Guess I will buy the original from a real book store.
The art of war is the art of control over the battlefield over your opponent and over yourself.
Bought for my boyfriend for Christmas
He really likes it.
This is a very poor excuse for a book
Theres  completely blank pages at the end
Its like they translated the original art of war through google translate.
Havent read it yet
But fiancee says it is a good read and explores the mind of the author.
Classic book
Everyone has heard at least a few proverbs from Sun Tzu and thats all this book is made up of
Its a light read and is nice to pick up for a page or two when cooking or something.
This is was a little different than I expected after hearing about it from so many different people
It is a good short read but most of it is actual strategy useful during the Dynasty wars
There are a few concepts from it that I am implementing in my own life though and would recommend anyone to read it as it is short and does contain some wisdom.
Nice to read even all these years after the first time I read it in high school
 Makes for great listening too on long trips.
Good read
I give this App a  Star because what it tells is still relevent in todays modern warfare
And the price cant be beat itd free
Id recommend this to all military personnel as a must read
And to all civilians who are interested in the Art of War
Id highly recommend this AppBook.
This is a short book of leadership strategy and tactics for war
There is wisdom for everyone regardless of your role in any career or job
Public administration is tied to this poem in terms of managing resources human capitol fellow servicemen and the public.
Got to be in a certain frame of mind for this one
 Might be empowering to someone fighting a battle in this world
 For the rest of us its either a yawn or disturbing
 Probably wont hurt you to read it but there is probably something else out there more empowering.
Great
Great knowledge for myself  an amaising book great insight  certainly a book for the ages  and for leaders of all  walks of life.
I read for pleasure and to hone my writing skills
This is a great classic.
Good advise for life
Not the real full book just a short summed up pamphlet about the original.
This ancient text is as useful today as it was in ancient history.
His genius is still followed to this day.
This book was for my husband
This book is very thin almost like a pamphlet
If I had known that I wouldnt have bought it.
Overrated
 Too many people try to quote from this book without actually reading it
Historically it shows an interesting perspective on conquering forces but there are better sources to get more complete information.
How on earth are all the other people giving this book  stars Surely they have not opened it they probably just bought it to leave it on their coffeetable to impress their friends
Well the cover does look nice but if you actually OPEN it youll rapidly see that 
There is NO forward author info translation notes or any other content
Not even an Index

Numerous mispelling and even missing text

Page titles at top are both the name of the book instead of chapter
Very useful
Sarcasm I bought  copies in order to give my friends
I will be giving these to Goodwill and buying a different version.
Looks like a google translate of chinese language
It was like reading the fortune from a fortune cookie 
love it just what I needed.
the test of time proves that not much changes in our world or the many years or warfare threw the centuries
This is a short version of the book
Disappointed because it didnt give any indication that this was a short version of the book in the descriptions
The worse part is I didnt read the reviews until now and other people had the same issues.
not the art of war book
Im not much of a reader but the history behind this book got me intrigued.
I prefer paperback and this short book was worth the read.
Should have just printed out a PDF or such online
While it is a book its merely a few pages of material thats professionally printed by the Amazon ondemand system
Meh
At least I helped someone make money...
It is an attractive little volume but the content is very limited
Guess Ill look at the full edition.
This seems kind of like a cliff notes version of the full book
Maybe Im wrong as I didnt read this one
It was a gift
It has larger print and is thinner than my copy however
Regardless this is a great price for a book that has many applications in life regarding strategy.
Most popular book for those with careers in the military
Everyone should read this short book
Good book Easy to read and i would suggest watching a movie that will show u some great strategies from the times it was written
Like Red Cliff or a good drama like General and I The general anything period that is chinese or korean So much fun
Great read packed with a great strategy in life advise.
The art of war is of vital importance to the State
It is a matter of life and death
A road either to safety or to ruin
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.
This is a good book for anyone
Business politics or just improving yourself
If you dont own it then just buy it
Its cheap short and you know you dont want to be a part of the  of Americans who have not bought a book in the last year
Lets bring that number down a bit
There is a reason this book is a wellknown classic
I found The Art of War to be insightful and useful for everyday situations as well as in reference to war
It is more about philosophy than actual combat and so it is not just for Generals and CEOs.
Wonderful read.
Shortdumbed down version of the real book
Do not waste your time and purchase then better luck at a half price books
Very disappointed with seller not putting this in summary.
I thought there would be more to it
I mean it served its purpose for what I was looking for but I guess there was not any explanation or illustrations
It was more like a starter book for other books of this ilk
It will force the reader to think about each section read so I believe that could be a good thing.
good product
Its a good overview of the book but sadly not the whole thing like I thought it to be
I still enjoy it though.
Not the full book just a shortened summary of it
Great Book
This product was extremely disappointing
I paid a high price for a very standard book which was supposed to be a special addition
I was hoping the cover would have been made out of a high quality material instead this book was a standard quality book at a very high price.
This is a little book I love while some it is changed by the logistics of our modern flightbased world of today the gist of it right to the point is that every time we ignored the most basic advice in this book we lost or backed out of a war that we failed to understand why the other side fought so hard for such as the Vietnam war where North Vietnams General Giap and the Vietcong used a very successful Go strategy while we lost the war by not understanding the strategy of the enemy attempted to use a chess strategy to our detriment.Go is a game where you occupy the most territory with the least number of pieces in chess you occupy the most territory with the most pieces with the sole objective being to capture the King
You will find much to contemplate in reading this book if you like to think and you value freedom democracy liberty and the responsibility of keeping and maintaining that democracy as the flipside of liberty
FreedomResponsibility go hand in hand to those who want to keep this experiment in democracy we love so dearly.
Just like described soft cover and delivered on time
Great book
This book though dry every now and then is very knowledgeable about warfare
This book is also great because even though its about warfare has so many other applications outside of warfare.
Great addition to my husbands library
Great book and read.
Very nice paper clear large font and nice spacing of text
Very easy to read
The actual content makes perfect sense and is easy to remember partially I think because of how it is presented.
And win
Ill definitely make this book a yearly read
I havent highlighted so much material in awhile
And will be putting some of these tactics into everyday living.
Fast shipping
Great book for me to jump in and out of
Slim so it doesnt take up much space
This book is as it name states an art
To follow this in life we could gain but to do as it tells not to will give defeats
This material must be repeatedly read in order to absorb its full impact
 Premises of The Art of War were violated over and over by the Bush administration and our Army
 I once understood that our military schools of war at one time studied this material.....
Now I guess not
DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION
Good product
Bought it because this is the book that started me on my life long journey.
This isnt even the whole book
Its a bunch of quotes from the original book
What a waste.
A must read for everyone esp for ladies if they are going thru a divorce.
Great book  I will complete my plans for world domination soon
 Allegedly the us armed forces still read this short book to give thought on the truth of how real war works
 Was also an entertaining read.
Great
VERY WELL DONE Highly Recommend
the art of war is a guide where the best war strategies are explained
concise straight foreward and logic strategies.
The manner in which the translations and explanations jump back and forth tends to be confusing
I found myself flipping back and forth a lot
Otherwise its an excellent read for anyone
As a supervisor Ive found that Ive applied a lot of the stratagem laid out in this book in my work life.
YUP  Ive read it and will be sending to my son
I see what some folks mean by being a hard read but its great education
The absolute best military strategy guide ever written.every soldier should read it.
I first read this as a library book as I did some research for an RPG character
I was fascinated by it and always wanted my own copy
I finally got one and its STILL as fascinating to me as it was originally.
Do not let the title fool you
This is not so much about war as it is about relationships and leadership
I am a  year old house wife and mother
 I am also a writer and constantly searching for insights and inspirations
 I inherited this copy of the book from my son when he left for college
 Read a page or two a day sometimes a paragraph will do  The words are thousands of years old but the wisdom is timeless.
some things dont change with time
the art of war discusses how to keep the big picture in focus maintain check and balances including hubris and  how to react to others
it is geared for generals wielding war in ancient China but the points are relevant for anyone doing business.
Great read
Gift for my husband
Not what he expected.
These rules certainly apply to the time of war but also apply to the business raising the young and to life in general.
Good product
Good book.
Sometimes to most simple things are the hardest to articulate but Sun Tzu is the master of turning simple psychology into art
 years later it is amazing how his words have stood the test of time and how prevalent they still are to this day.
A lot of word definition searches not a thriller but interesting and a quick read
Most will lose interest on the first page.
Alot thinner than I remember but still contain useful information
I love
this is a pamphlet it isnt the actual book
Love this book
As described and shipping was fast Happy with my order.
The link I thought I was purchasing was a version translated by Thomas Cleary with an introduction and commentary
This version the black cover white lettering with red shadow and red lines has neither and there is no mention of who the translator is.
Great read
The one problem I have is that the commentary can get REALLY annoying
Gets in  the way of the main text
I know the only way to do away with it is to read it in the original Chinese but maybe have a footnote for the pointm then have the commentary at the end of the chapter.
Brief interesting read Every politician and business and military leader should give this work consideration
If I could I would send a copy to the White House
I doubt it would be read though.
to overcome theose who seek to destroy you one must first understand their ideology and intent and then refrain from getting mired by fear in a normalcy bias when they say they are committed to kill you.
Came as a pamphletbrochure
No binding and cheaply made.
The full length book is great
This however is someones cliff notes of the book
And its not even a good summary
This is not the full length book.
Great product fast shipping
Id buy again...and again  I love it..
Do NOT waste your money...this is a useless poorly written HIGH level summary
I am disappointed
This is not a real book and nowhere it says that these are notes from the book very thin book disappointing.
Cant beat the price for this book.
Do not buy this
Its not the actual book
 Theyll take your money immediately and youll never see it again.
Its the Art of War.
For over a decade now this book has made the rounds in my inner circle and Everyone seemed to thoroughly enjoy it
As for me I saw very little use for such a book
And since I see no real use I felt no real delight I suppose young military leaders would enjoy this.
Thanks
Good book thought it would be longer
I have seen this book used as a reference for many years
 Wish I had read it when I was a young man.
I ripped the cd so I can listen to it on my phone at work
No good all I get is my cd and the chapters reading the same
I used Media Monkey to rip and look up Amazon DB for tagging still nothing
It is very annoying when stopping and starting during the day to know what chapter youre on
So this was a waste of money and time trying to tag it and listen to it
Especially when many other audio books are in the same format and trying to go back I may end up listening to another book all together
Not worth the effort to try and manually tag each track
Lesson learned for me and will sell it at work.
Cheap cover is pixelated A F
But it was  bucks
I can no declare war on the Chinese.
This book illustrates a lot of fundamental aspects of how to conduct a operation I thought the concepts were true and basic
 For a more in depth reading experience that is if you dont already know what your buying and what you want I suggest machiavellis art of war
 Matter of taste I guess
 I enjoyed both books I feel I walked away with more from machiavellis art of war.
Fav book came as supspected
The Art of War was interesting when you think about how old this book is and see the different tactics discussed in it
 I have heard many times too that this is a good read for people in the business world today
 I agree with that in part
 There are parts of the book that are translatable to the business world but a lot that are not
Overall it is a very short book
 Im glad I finally read it but not one I was blown away by.
False advertisement
Should clearly state what chump change edition means somewhere
This is NOT The Art of War this is someones poor summary of the book.
I had heard so much about The Art of War I decided to read it
 Alas its only one hundred seventy largefont pages
 What saves this book is the very good introduction some sixtyfive pages that I would have been lost in the sauce without.
I dont remember buying this book
 It probably was for my English class when I was an undergrad in college
 Im not sure I dont remember sorry Im not more helpful
 However I do know about the book and after reading it a couple of times I do understand it more clearly now and it is good
A classic truly a must have but this format sucks book is too thin and too wide for my taste
An excellent read
The principles of this book apply to so many aspects of life
It is not a long book
In fact it is very short
That being said you could read it in an hour or two or you could chew on its words for an entire lifetime.
Just as described the way it should be.
One of the best books I ever read....but it took me a few times to fully understand what Sun Tzu was saying
The philosophies in this book can be applied to most anything and should be a mustread for every leader.
DO NOT BUY This is false advertising I am so disappointed
This is not The Art of War
This is a cheap photocopied book of bullet points
I am so upset
What a waste

No where in the description does it say it is a shortened version of the book
I feel like I was ripped off.
This is a great read and I am surprised it isnt required reading in schools
Can provide great outlooks on life Decision making and leadership
A timeless classic that I hope stays with us forever.
Reading
This is not the book it has quotes and is abbreviated even compared to cliff notes
 If you want a very simple gist of real book this may be for you.
Awsome book
If you like learning about ancient civilization army rules and leadership..
this is definitely the book for you
Dont forget this is and asian book which was translated to English
The version is ok and the translation is awsome as well.
This is a shortened  page version of the book
Nowhere on the page was it stated that this was anything but the full book
This is a rip off.
Description was not clear.
I enjoy skimming through the statements.
Great book if you want to learn about strategy in any context.
Read this several times in my life  I purchased this copy for a friend as he had never read it
Buy it  read it
You wont regret it.
Not the full book
Dont buy.
Nice book
Helps ya understand howwhywhere and what your enemy expects.
The Best Buy
I love these books
Not that much info after hearing about this book in various movies and other books Slow but interesting read Bought the small non fancy version hoping to get into the material
This is something that is worth listening too.
Cant wait to read
Scam
Not the real book

a little on the small side a good light read but has all the good info
This book is packed with great information for life on and off the battlefield
So many of its principles apply to sports and the business world
Students if you need to write a paper on some military event in history this book should be your starting point
Use it to back up your main points or thesis and youll win the day
The book was very helpful to receive
It served as a welcomed gift.
This give a stylized and sparse outline of some possible principles of was as it pertains to feudal times
Very little applies to todays types of conflicts and provides little to no true advice about conflict resolution.
I think this is one of the must read books everyone should read once in their lifetime
 Not only does it give a good outlook on miltary tactics it tells you the logic behind them..
which you can apply to other situations or intances in life
A quick and easy read
Maybe not the most entertaining but still interesting.
Read this simply because its a classic
Nothing really terrific here not sure its worth paying for
Go rent it at a library
Book versiontranslation was good.
Although this book talks about war the principles taught in this book can be put to use in any area of your life
The Art of War is short but a good read
A classic that is still relevant today
This is a good book to read if you were living in  AD
These ancient techniques no longer apply in .
The first of the book is essentially a bullet pointed list that can translate very well into the business world.
Strategically wonderful  It helps you to uderstand the actual art of planning and executing any type of war think of it from all of its aspects
 I encourage you to purchase this book it is well worth its price.
A good interpretation of a classic
 Would recommend.
A classic well worth the read if you are interested in how war is fought It is not only used for war but everyday life problems and things like business.
First time trying to buy The Art of War and had not realized this was a summary and the listing does not mention this book is in fact a summary.
This was a good bookit was just more dry of a story than what I usually like to read
I recommend this if you are more into the Buddhist cultureas it is centered on pretty much killing your enemies with kindness.
Good
Great job providing The Art of War affordably
 Quality of printing is ok.
I was very disappointed to learn that this was an outline of the book when I got it yesterday
I was really looking forward to reading an actual book.
I have heard this book touted as great so many times that I finally decided to give it a try
 I was most disappointed
 The book is just a series of oneliners on different things to do in war
 Some of the little oneliners didnt even make much sense
 And the book is totally disorganized with no connection from one oneliner to the next
 And finally there were way too many editing errors
 I was expecting a wellthoughtout and organized expose on how to carry out a successful war....something on the order of Machiavellis very astute and very clear way to obtain and retain power as set out in The Prince
 No comparison.
Looks good
Unlike the Griffin translation this edition which is from the late th century intermixes the text and the commentary
 In a way thats good because its easier to associate the text to the commentary but sometimes the commentary isnt all that good or insightful.
A gift
The Art of War is famous throughout the world for good reason and is required reading by many business schools law schools government intelligence and military organizations and all for goo dc reason
I believe anyone in our global job market would also benefit from reading this book.
Book is basically translated versions of quotes written by Sun Tzu
Little hard to grasp as it lacks detailed explanation but still a great book to have.
I tried several times to read this book
I even got half way through it before I gave up the last time
It is just plain BORING There isnt even colorful descriptors to keep you awake
Truthfully after trying three times to read this I still have absolutely no idea what its about.
Not sure what all the fuss is about with this book
I didnt find it to be at all great
Its short though so if you want to find out for yourself its not a big commitment.
Great book can apply in negotiating daily obstacles without arms
You can use to improve your outcome.
This is THE classic ageless work of warfare.
Every man should read this woman too You could practically utilize any lens to whats in these teachings and apply them to everything.
This is a wellrespected and inexpensive book written more than two thousand years ago
It can teach you many things.
Rip off
A classic short read
If we can decipher the meanings behind it has some valuable information that can be applied to life.
I fell for it
Its not a full book
Its  pages and printed by a random amazon seller making money off someone elses work.
If you have not read this book I dont know how you got a business mgt
job...
Its cutthroat and how life really is..
As a former combat Marine a lot of this hits home
As a business man every page hits home
Lives up to the hype
Timeless messages.
I found it to be a tough read
The content is fine and not excellent.
Bought as Christmas gifts for my sons
Both are history buffs and both are looking forward to reading this book.
Received on time and as expected.
Rip off  Nothing but list of chapter headings
 Thief
A classic read
I can see why people use this little book as a life manual and can be applied to most any lifestyle jobcareer andor multiple situations.
Not so much a book but just excerpts
 Can read it in an hour or less
Who cares for  tho
Arrived sooo fast with only a few days notice and the book is gorgeous
 The leather cover is beautifulreminiscent of the days when books were hand made before printing presses
A book bought for my daughter  she enjoyed it
it was want i was looking for thank you.
This is the book to do it
Albeit a bit old school but if youre willing to line up like they did back in the day this is a great tactician book
I think overall this was to show how you should think if you want to lead.
The Art of War is a classic
I have read it  times at least
We actually read it in one of my jobs as well
You can apply what you read in the Art of War to so many aspects of life
I would highly recommend reading it.
good read
Just as described and very fast shipping thank you
This is a classic text that I have never read before
 It is so interesting to see the perspective that it offers and the applications and relevance that it has today
 A book that is remarkable in its simplicity and expression of common sense
 It makes me wonder how and where weve lost our way.
great read
I thought the book would be much bigger
Turns out this was sort of like a pamphlet
I guess you get what you pay for.
Disliked it wasnt the full book dont buy trust me i just biught another book this one has  pages
I loved the book
Short read full of wisdomknowledgestrategy tacticsand ways
For the past present and future.Book wasis and will be as well as can be translated and acted in life in many ways not just war.
This book is a classic and full of wisdom
 If I were you Id pay another  and get a decent cover and translationthis one had misspellings and incomplete sentences
 If you just want the text you can read this for free online.
I had been aware of this book for many years but always bypassed it
 A mentor recently recommended it as an important resource for a different perspective on the business world
 I found that this small volume spurred a lot of ideas for me
 A great place to learn some tools for negotiation.
Perfect as a flash card idea but the actal writing of the book jumps quickly from one idea to the next no to say the idea of such trait is not unlike a general commanding his army but the writing lacks ideas and leave little for the imagination to work with simply put its more of a lesson book to a reader to take command of something and then tacticianlly keep it weather it be a life style roll or a idea or psyical thing
Specializing in a singular idea war the facts on how to control and be victorious in a battle of metal or mind.
Excellent book of ancient but still relevant wisdom of war tactics and strategy
This is the best it was beautifully put together
Not even the full text
Does not mention that anywhere in the description its just cliff notes.
Loved it
I bought this for the kindle app
It was free
 I had read it once before in paperback form and loved it
 It seems to be better than I remember it from  years before
I think this should be required reading for everyone at least once.
The art of war is a great book
Good for strategic planning.
Good read it prepares you for life before Drama happens.
It was alright I mean its a classic so I had to read it but I totally think that are better books you can read about business or war the good thing is that is a very short read so you can finish it in less than a day like I did
The classic breakdown of how to gain and leverage an advantage
Sun Tzu was mostly writing about military strategy but his principles can be applied to almost anything in these modern times
Very interesting
Ancient Wisdom when dealing with battle and military might
I guess I was expecting the wisdom to translate over into everyday life in the modern  corporate or civilian world
It didnt
 However after studying this book I have learned that strategy and taking your enemy into account in all its variables weakness and strengths is to have higher ground when accessing your attack plans
Basically know your enemy inside and out then let them fall prey to your plans
 I am glad this was a short book because it took a lot of strain to decipher this stuff
It wasnt a fun read at all but I am glad that now I can say that I read it
 Definitely a read for those with an acquired taste
Otherwise a more compatible self empowerment book may be more useful.
Not what I expected
Did not like the format AT ALL
Waste of money.
What can you say about this email book
This has been studied by all branch of the USA armed services professional courses taken by Officers and NCO s
Great email book
I love it.
Just what I was looking for
A classic
Not the full length version had some weird sticky substance on the front cover and back cover
it was not proofed they used spell check and spell check didnt catch wrong words head instead of heed if you dont know what youre reading it could be confusing
great deal
Lots of great insight with this one
Actually a very easy read and chockfull of principles that apply to getting ahead in life not only in war
 The timeless principles are broken up into bite sized chunks that dont take a lot of your time to consume
 Good read well worth my time.
Bought this mainly as a required reading for myself
 Theres plenty of books out there that parody this philosophy
 Mainly I bought it as a reference
 People may think your weird though if quote it all the time around the water cooler.
LARGE PRINT easy to read with a strong cover for a paperback Good value at only  its a classic go get it and keep winning
great read
Not the one expected
This is for kids
Great book
Unbelievable This is like a  page summary of the book
ITs NOT THE FULL TEXT I cant believe I got scammed out of  for this crap.
Great product
About  pages only
NOT THE FULL version
We should be given a refund Thought I was getting the whole book
Amazon should do something about this
Nowhere does it say its not a full version.
Dont buy this..
its cheap and..
the translation is so bad
You wont understand the meaning.
It is only a summary
This fact is not stated in the description of the book
This book was drab in some parts and interesting in others
Some of the commentary was too extensive for the average reader
I love how the lessons of Sunni are still relevant in modern warfare.
Beware This is NOT the whole book
I am retired military  years and have used this book throughout my career
Now that I am retired and working in the civilian sector I still apply a lot of principles from the Art of War.
Just added this to my collected editions of books good read
This is not the full book which is what I intended to buy
 Not advertised well enough that its a shortened version.
Sister loves this book Great Xmas gift
Ive been meaning to read The Art of War for several years now
Grabbed this translation because it was free
The translator does a good job of comparing various other translations of the book and noting where they differ and what he thinks is the most likelyaccurate translation of a particular passage.
Strategy at best.
I get the main characters point Great book and very informative
Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer
Characters and other plot.
An amazing manual for nearly everything in life Sun Tzus knowlege transcends all time and all people
As he said the best way to win is to not fight at all.
Love it Very insightful
Very good insight despite being a centuries old document
I wouldve given it five stars but the illustrated aspect if the book was poor on the paper white kindle.
The art of management is very much like the art of war
 If you are a manager or want to be a manager this is one of the very best books to read.
perfect
Condensed version
It took ten minutes to read the whole book
The full version is better.
Heard it via audio and it was really good interesting and helpful
Great information and perspective on how to use your mind and resources to conquer all of your goals.
I ordered this in large print and they did not disappoint My boyfriend is super excited
Great read
Great and applies to life in many ways.
This paperback edition was in new shape and easy to understand
Highly recommend this book for anyone studying the subject of strategy in relation to competitive business or in general.
Finally read it
When I was in Bschool everyone said this was a MUST read...but I never got around to it
Having read it now my reaction is meh.
classic book if youre able to abstractly apply these concepts to life you can get ahead much easier.
Very short reads less than  minutes but good information.
Great read.
Gelreat meaning book
It is a great reference or the adageoftheday sort of book that you can read to gather and clear your thoughts and organize and launch your next attack read critical decision.
It is book
I love book.
This has become my favorite book i have read this a dozen times very good quality paper and binding
Would definitely recommend this book i love it
Fast easy read good book.
A classic and more fun to read as an adult than when in school and thus forced to read it
Certainly has some life lessons not sure if that is a good or bad thing though.
Relates to many different areas of business and life
Anyone interested in reading a timeless classic should make a note of this book.
For a book I consider required reading this is a nice Kindle edition
 Im a stickler for formatting and although there would be a few changes I would make the text is fairly accurate.
This is the best Kindle version I could find among other badly formatted comment riddled versions on the Kindle Store but this one is nicely prepared and worth buying and reading

I feel as though I can lead an army.
Tactics and philosophies from this book can be incorporated into any aspect of life that we face.
A Bible for future Military Officers
One of the first kindle books purchased
I enjoyed the simplicity of reading
The structure of the book and the information made for excellent reading
This book should be read by business people and leaders.
it takes awhile to understand how to read and interpit this book a must read if you know anything about the art of war its not just about war its about life should be mandatory read would recommend
Short version of the book
I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you want a short version.
Wheres the rest of the book Shocked to receive a summary book and not the full text Ripoff central with this purchase and it doesnt say anything in the description when purchasing
Laughable really..
pages of bullet points
I feel like this is something that I would see while surfing facebook.
It is what I expected needed my copy.
Thank you
A friend recommended that I read The Art of War by Sun Tzu and I had to look every where just to find an edition containing the words of Sun Tzu
Other reworks were filled with so much commentary that it was difficult to actually understand what Sun Tzu was saying
This copy gives of the work is clear and easy to read it is extremely enticing and even though it was written more than  hundred years ago it is probably more relevant now than ever before
The introduction written by Steven Schrang is also enticing and gives great insight into who Sun Tzu was
Great Read
a clasic
Tiny little book with so much information.
nice book
smaller than expected
Classic book
A must read for anyone looking for something different.
Teaches you a new way to think.
Thought it was longer but good read
I have been studying and reading and rereading this book for inclusion in my studies in combat readiness movement of troops and completion of battle in various locations and climates
 An excellent work.
I have read a few versions of The Art of War
This is my favorite version
I will have to read it a few more times before I will be self satisfied by the teachings.
Third reading
 Great and useful
I have multiple copies
 Recommended reading for any leader.
Great read though a tad challenging but that is what draws you in
It is The Art of War by Sunzi translated to english
This is on The Comandants Reading List for the United States Marine Corps
Read it Understand it Apply it to national policy and gain understanding of war economics as well as the decline of the U.S
military as a fighting force.
I liked this book It was interesting and a lot of what is said could apply not only to war but to business or to sport or to teaching
Overall an interesting read.
Just horrible
I couldve printed a nicer copy at home
About  pages long and felt like a high school students summary of Sun Tzus philosophy.
I purchased this as a gift for Christmas as it was on the recipients Amazon list
They thanked me and were thrilled.
I think its a good book I would know if I could get it back from my sons 
This is the book that men would want for general reading
Simple statements that can generate conversation
Easy.
This is the highly abridged version
Still some neat info
I liked the book because we all face the art of war in our daily lives
Wheather  we have to meet a deadline at work or working out to stay fit
The art of war is at play in our lives.
book is good I guess I am just not into it like I tght I would be
An excellent book as everyone knows of course
A recommended read for all persons
A true timeless classic
A must read for any young adult or aspiring leader of menwomen.
A classic of classics
 The man who best understood war has taught generations how prepare and prevent it
 Worthy of deep study and application in all aspects of life.
Very misleading
This isnt a real version of the book
Its just a summary.
I really like the messages of both Hubbarts letter is incredible and full of good sense
The Art of the war on the other hand is a must for your life it contains the solution for many human concerns
Both are amazing.
I think this is the cliff notes to the actual book.
I have heard this book referenced in popular culture for years as something that provided lessons in war that were applicable to conflict and contained good strategy advise across the spectrum
 I have to say I agree.
A must read for anyone who has a tough struggle
This book is thin light and perfect for travel
Not ideal as a gift ..
It is flimsy if you want a nice copy Id look for another one.
Classic  be advised which version you buy
This was a lot smaller than I expected
Thats on me tho ya digg I recommend the shambhala dragon edition translated and edited by Thomas cleary Its got indepth breakdowns of the material that pull from multiple perspectives.
This is so far from anything that resembles the original
This is a book that focuses your mind and makes you think of things that would not commonly occur to you as a matter of strategy be it life work or war.
And MORE NINJAS
But really what can I say its Sunzis Art of War you either want to read it or you dont
I read this and proceeded to beat my neighbor up
Good read.
A classic
Ive listened to the audio book a few times have read it in a business strategy class and purchased it for my library
Would recommend
A classic not to be missed
Very easy to read practical adive
Applies to everyday lifes decisions.
This is the BEST book on strategy that has ever been written This book is timeless
I have seen strategies from this book utilized in business and politics
It does not take long to read but has a wealth of information.
The art of war may be required reading at the war college but I did not enjoy the book
Too much conversation about women and not in a good way
I deleted it from my kindle.
I have heard about the book for years and so I was very curious what it was about
 Its not overly large so that is good for me
 I found the book to be informative and easy to read.Two thumbs up
A must read for anyone interested in politicsbusinessphilosophy or just life in general
This has a lot of meaning to those who read it properly though understanding all of it may take time.
This is NOT the full book
This is more of the Clifnotes edition of the book.
This is a very cheaply made book pages in mine were detached and some were cut unevenly even though its brand new its very short from what I remember too...
The Art of War is a timeless masterpiece of interaction of power and politics
It is about war and not war
This version is the one you want if you are interested in the simple yet profound wisdom of Sun Tzu
I have tried several other versions edited and commented on thoughts and ideas spun left and spun right by other authors
There is no spin here simple staright forward thought and principles.
A must read
Simple
Literally
Does provide good strategies.
Good read
A great classic warfare book written by a man ahead of his time
Very good read
Book came in paperback and is skinnysmall but looks well and is a highly recommended read for the price
Highly recommend reading this book
 The philosophies behind the logic are practical enough for everyday use for example negotiations
 It is no wonder why so many business professionals read this book.
Purchased as a gift
Thank you.
Exactly what I expected
I would recommend this book to anyone in the military or in leadership
It gives great insight into strategic thinking.
the greats never become out dated
 the lessons in this book can be applied to most aspects of life
have wanted to read this for years getting it on amazon finally made it possible
Trustworthy sellerVery good book Recommend
Great literary classic
Good quality for a trade paperback
Very fairly priced
 Nice glossy cover.
Not the original book
Cheap copy.
Interesting read
 Common sense suggestions and instructions that applies to more than war.
This a fun read.
very entertaining.
Since this great book now fits inside my phone it is not a bad app for the price
I definitely do not regret my purchase and think almost everyone who gets this will feel the same way.

If you need tips on handling situations in every day life you will enjoy this book
People of all ages can get great advice from this read try it today
Not the book by Sun Tzuthis a condensed misspelled version.
Have not rade it all.
This version was straight to the point and not too long
Not sure if other versions were longer
Reads like an army commanders tips and tricks manual to running an army.
good read
This is not the entire book
I dont even know what this is.
This book is a classic and should be read by anyone looking to get ahead in life
IT does not have to be about war as much as common sense about thinking ahead
Good read good message.
wise man said some basic wisdom lines about life and struggle of life
human nature hasnt changed much so it is true even nowdays
a splendid prospective for any strategy student today
booyah
A great read
Teaches you lessons that can be used in your everyday life.
Nice addition to my library.
Not the full book Misleading do not buy
The original Chinese might not have been perfect but the English translator could have done a better job elucidating on some of the passages
 Many are just plain sloppy.
Ive not read any other interpretations but I feel like Im missing something.
The simplicity and straightforwardness of this book is why it had survived for so many years
These truths in ancient warfare still hold true today
Know your enemy
Know when to attack to ensure victory
These simple will get you far in life.
I had to read this for a class and what I took away from it was the lessons have meaning in modern times and will be a source of knowledge for years to come.
Awesome book.
I read it already in French and I did now in English
This is a nice presentation of an otherwise difficult read
 The book is well presented and of course a must read for business professionals ..
just so you can hold your own when someone sitting across the table from Harvard Business School starts quoting it
 Perhaps overthought Im sure their are better tools for getting its point across theres nothing like the original.
Provides with logic and philosophy applicable to everyday life and business great brain exercise
Helps if you can use your imagination to apply it to your life.
Great Read
I cant tell you how frequently I lost upwards of  men in battle that is until I read this book
I was frequently losing men to fatigue and simply not controlling my army effectively
After purchasing my victory rate has increased significantly and I am a much more trained war general
Very good daytoday read for prospective buyers who control armies.
I bought this as I read another review which mentions this book as a better alternative
Was not as thrilled as I thought I would be
I have other books on the Art of War that are far more explanation and practical use driven than this one
 The principles are easy but sometimes it was the commentaries from other military science leaders that convoluted the meanings and put their spin on Tzus philosophy
While this is good for some I bought this book for myself and another to just get the nuts and bolts.
why havent you ordered it yet
D
Easy to follow and the fonts were large enough to read.
This is definitely a book that should be required as a read for anyone Very well written especially considering the fact that our was written more than  years ago.
An excellent price for a classic book
 Delivered promptly.
As Promised and on time
 Thanks
This was a great read.
Son not impressed
Highly regarded by my friends who served in the military I found the book most interesting in that the supposedly reallife author SunTzu penned a series of letters that b came one of the earliest handbooks of war fighting
The translation I read had way too much commentary inserted throughout the text making it difficult to get into the rhythm of the book
And obviously the translations that survived are incomplete
Chapters appear to be missing entire sections there is much that is desultory and even contradictory especially the many chapters and sections on terrain and even more that is simply obvious even in the era these writings were thought to be composed.
This version does include most if not all of the maxims in Sun Tzus Art of War
Unfortunately with no introduction no context no commentary and no annotations present in many other versions its hard to make any sense of this vague and metaphorical ancient text
I would advise against buying this version if you want a thorough understanding of this seminal work.
All warfare is based on deception
Quotes are applicable in all walks of life
The physical book is great and the contents are well worth the read
The book is an outline of a book Total waste of money
I get a little more out of this every time I read it very deep.
dismt realize it was a cliff note version my bad quick delivery
This is a great book our government should read it so we do not have extended wars that are not then net answer to a solution.
These were for a prison library
 Very helpful for the inmates
 Helps with chess and negotiation.
As described.
It arrived with other items in a big box but the item was in perfect condition
The book is not the complete version.
Amazing
Not a full length book
It doesnt say that in the product description
I feel tricked.
Classic book about ancient military strategy
 Many applications to military leadership but also to the business world
 Take time to read this classic.
excellent  nineteen more words not required all i need is my personal opinion of this product still need more words
 this form is why more products are not reviewed
Great book that you can apply to your everyday life
I highly recommend people read this at least twice That way you can get a better understanding of it.
good read explains warfare up to today this is great know how for a lot of things in life not just warfare pick this book up if you even have half a brain.
A if you want a basic translation
For the price it was worth it.
Good book
Small and nice printing
I hope to memorize this book and use the wisdom written in this book.
what time you need to kill a small amount of years and I have no choice but to be fair years and the green bay packers are not too much youre to the yard and got it from a bit late to
This is a great book
 The art of war teaches us not to fight a war if its not a surewin
 The philosophy behinds this is to reserve the scarce resources and human lives never fight a war on impulse
 Plan calculate and win
 If not a surewin diplomacy and negotiation are preferred
 The original The Art of War in Chinese was written in th century BC had only thirteen chapters and about six thousand Chinese characters not a huge book but the content was timetested proven to be effective even nowadays
 Read it you wont regret.
This is the best edition for easy understanding
 Principles are still relevant in todays world
 I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to read the Art of War
It was O.K
but not what I expected
 Maybe better for you.
Outstanding book as accurate today as it was s of years ago.
yea
Good quick.
Amazing book
I will definitely be keeping this on my shelf and reading it again and again for years to come.
I liked it very much
 Can apply much of what I read to different aspects of life.
book in very good condition just like represented
 thanks
The book is more like cliff notes.
Buy it
Read it
Apply it to your life
Historically this is a timeless book on successfully fighting and strategically planning battles.
Its doesnt really tell you how to do anything its all just proverbs and rules
Dont waste your money.
This piece has survived through the ages as a testament to the persistence of human spirit
While long and challengingthis book will enlighten you greatly
Enjoy 
I received this book today in great condition and quite quickly but it is not as described
 It is only a translation and without any commentary as is mentioned in the product description.
GREAT
great book
The Art of War is so applicable to so many aspects of life you simply have to read it to appreciate it
Its a free download on Amazons Kindle too so you cant go wrong there.
Kind of a cut down version but still a good read
I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesnt have a lot of time to read.
Fascinating must read for every warmilitary buff
This is a masterpiece I will read and reread and reread until it becomes instinctual.
MANY OF TODAYS MILITARIES HAVE THIS AS REQUIRED READING FOR THEIR OFFICERS INSIGHT COMMON SENSE AND GREAT STRATEGY SFTER READING THIS I IMPROVED MY CHESS GAME
This would be better for a solider.
The book is probably not as smoothly produced  edited as other versions of The Art of War
 Compare the presentation of a couple of versions before settling on the one that suits you best.
Great buy
Worth every penny.
I have read approximately  of the book and I like it very much
 I appreciate it since I served in the Military of the United States of America and a proud Veteran
damn when i read this book i feel like im in the war and im godmode everyone just cant kill me damn i so pro
NIce deal
Excellent book  Truly a must read classic
Wish I had this in the military
The concepts that are described in the writings of Sun Tzu work equally well in warfare and in business.
Learn what he knew thousands of years ago..
applies to war business and life.
I found large chunks of the book were missing in this format
 At the time I bought this i didnt know how common this is in public domain works.
It is written as a war tactic manual by a couple thousand year old Chinese dude
Insert sarcasm after this point.
Basically a quick summary
gets to the point.
The Art of War  Kindle Edition  I have heard about the Art of War for some time now and decided to read it
 I am mostly through it and it is as much a life guide for those like Donald Trump or John D
Rockefeller to win at all costs as it is a guide to Warring
 It points out much as to how you should handle situations and like the bible for the needy it is rather written as hyperbole and generalities of situations not a detailed explanation of each battle situation
 I really emphasizes deceit and distraction rather than actually just racing to battle
 Preparation and patience are also much of the emphasis
 It OK but of course it is a basic primer.
I love this book
ok
Nice quality for a paperback
 Glossy cover and easy read font size.
Everybody should have the opportunity to read this book
It has been quoted by many people over the course of the years
Buy it and enjoy it
I read this in the bathroom when pooping
Gets the job done.
Contradictory instructions for how to win a military campaign
 Just about anything you do could be wrong or right
 Translation could have been much better
 If you are a military freak it is a must read.
Overhyped  not so great.
Item as described.Great price and great service
item as described
Cliff notes version
Can learn so much from a classic 
Recieved a highlighted copy.
its Ok
Weird.
Smaller than I thought but great book fr
This book had tons of useful knowledge that I personally feel could be used in everyday life
How you tackle your problems headon to how to avoid certain problems altogether
Great buy to better enrich your life as well as your thinking.
my own copy
Would give  stars if I could
Just a random persons clif notes summary
Do NOT buy.
It is good quality but i think some stuff is missing from the original
Also needs to be spell checked
I found some grammatical errors.
Perfect
A interesting description of the oriental mind and how it crafted the outcome of various wars
A primer for military students
All warfare is based on deception.
For anyone who wants to learn the history of warfare and strategies revolving around it this is the book for you
Perfect for tacticians and strategists alike.
NOT ACTUAL BOOK
 Summary of book not the full text
This is not a book in the sense I thought it would be
 It looks like a cutcopypaste of some content stapled inside a cheap cover.
Was pleasantly surprised when we got the book
It got here  days ahead if schedule and was new 
Bought it as used if it is used who ever owned it never broke the spine.
Dont buy
Perhaps I have been spoiled by the James Clavell writing of this classic but I was less than impressed with this version it just didnt seem to have the feel I expected.
My order shipped on time It was in good condition and the shopping cost was reasonable
The book itself was great
Although it was a coffee table version the text was clear and the few illustrations were also clear.
Good book so far however I will say some of the vocabulary used stumped me a bit but the book overall is great
Great book
Always a classic
I love these classic books They are timeless and never get old
Anyone can relate to the characters and thats what makes them so amazing
classic book it iss a quick easy read and extremely insightful even with its age
Too many notes by the author
It breaks up the text too much
Great stuff just poorly placed IMO
Tada

Can be more concise overall good book
NOT THE FULL BOOK  VERY MISLEADING  NOT COOL
For business for everyday life and more..
I evaluated this book with a  star because I have been using the suggestion its giving in real life
And its certainly help
At least its helps you to make a decision promptly.
Great book....
An excellent book on strategic planning that can be applied to your daily life in work or dealing with people.
Good Book
This is an excellent edition and translation of this classic
The forwards essay is essential to contextualize The Art of War and its philosophical context and the words of Sun Zi are followed by notes from wellknown strategists.
Book is total BS  This is nothing more than a summary at best of Sun Tzu writings
 It was a waste of money and I would advise any person to be dilligent in verifying what you are buying.
If you want to study Sun Tzus philosophy this is not the book to order
 The worst translation Ive ever seen.
I thought this was by Sun Tzu
Short book and to the point just like I like it
A wealth of information that you can use in other areas of your life.
I should have checked but I was really disappointed that the book was so incredibly thin
For the price I cant really complain.
Solid advice that lasts throughout the centuries  unfortunately this advice comes from a monster of barbaric proportions.
Interesting
Thanks fast service
A very good version of the manuscript
Sincerely Terrence W.
Hubby loves it
Great book I recommend it for anyone who likes to learn about the real world.
The First Thus edition from Filiquarian publishing is a terrible translation
I suspect they used Google Translate with a bit of help from a human
They dont even list the translator
As another reviewer pointed out it reads like those terrible instructions you get in cheap Chinese products
This book as with many historical books is difficult to shop for on Amazon
Im headed to my local BN to flip through different translations.
Buyer beware This is not the actual book
It is a scam
Great
one of many books that teaches how we should live our lives
Its a book that can be applied to far more than war
 One of a very small selection of books that I keep rereading
 Besides I couldnt beat the price.
The strategies taught apply to everything in life business and work
So basically it teaches how to strategize properly
It is a must read.
More people should read this book in todays society
Its a great book
It teaches you a lot of different materials
I just wanted to read it
I had heard good reviews about it so I wanted to see for myself
amazeballs
I had to study sections of this in the US Army while training to work in Military Intelligence.
You be ashamed of yourself
 Very misleading
 Do not buy.
Great book
 A must read
 So many modern day correlations
I now know how to defeat my enemies
It met my expectations
There was great ancient incite between the covers.
Its a lot smaller then I though it would be I thought it would be the full book
But that is probably my fault for not reading all the information.
Very nice classic book Everyone should read this book I like this book a lot but i also like  laws of power better
Thanks
Great vision of an ancient warrior
While a number of his thoughts are common sense he has had the forsight to put them all into practice which has made him Chinas greatest General
reat read
Great book to live life by
You can read a page  a day and apply it to your personal and professional  life  situations.
An excellent book that has application to the business world life and military as well.
Amazing book with great insight Thankful that I read it
Thank you very much
anybody with an ambition to excel at almost anything should read this book.
its not a narrative and can be read in small amounts without the danger of missing something.
just some very interesting and widely applicable anecdotes and philosophies..
A must
Awesome Book
very good reed book came fast and in great shape very happy lot of help full think came from this book that can be applied to life it self 
I have never been to war
So I would never stand in judgment of those who have 
 Fundamental and sound strategies
Condensed version dont waste your money.
Four stars due to the translation which was a little sloppy
Otherwise an interesting read that I always thought about reading.
Wow this is a fantastic little book Im so happy it found its way to me
Its ok
I am sure he was way before his time.
My expectations were way too high when I ordered this book so I was somewhat disappointed
Not that its a bad book
I just expected something different
Keep an open mind.



not like the book
The CD left out too much information
Too expensive for one CD.
I bought this book  years ago and to this day I still read it it has really helped me with my life tactics in business and work.
Great book No wonder its among the books that all managers have to read
Absolutely recommended to anyone who wants to learn to rule their life.
I finally ran out of excuses for not having a dead tree copy of this.
This is a work that changes each time you read it
The text doesnt necessarily change but you change your interpretation each time.
Just as described.
A classic
 Each translation a little different
 Each reading reveals something previously unseen.
Its the art of war .enough said.
Any and everyone interested in leadership should read this book
 The situations addressed in the book can be applied to all kinds of situations in war in business in leading any body and in many other facets of life.
Its simply put together this is a must read staple.
Great book
A must read.
Just as applicable today if not more so as when it was written  years ago
 Some great quotes throughout
Although written thousands of years ago its relevant today
I love the size of book and the various Chinese illustrations inside that mark the beggining of a chapter
I was hoping for something that was more readable and understandable
I thought that this book provided strategies in short form but it does not.
Great read
war is deception
Not the entire book more like a summary.
its cheap because it is some sort of reduced size reprint
Guess it is nice to carry around as it is small.
Cant get enough of this.
wonderful read
Classic book on war to help you in business.
Great thanks
 page short version
Excellent book
I recommend it to anyone in a leadship role
In fact I have recommended to my friends when we often get into those heated political discussions.
It is a really good translation.
Great buy learning alot
Awesome
Great Classic to read.
Interesting read not too dense but full of unique viewpoints to consider.
Great
Great book Very dense and the lessons contained within still applies to today.
It came quickly
No shipping with prime
 The product was described correctly
I would buy again
A must read
Useful for a lot of things in life.
GREAT PRICE AND A LOT CHEAPER THEN STORE...
interesting book
A must have for any book shelf Nice short timeless quips of knowledge.
Just wow
With this guide I was able to defeat all of my enemies except one otherwise  stars.
The art of war the best strategist book
Everyone should read this book.
Excellent
needed another copy so went for Kindle edition
A must read very political leader and military personnel and anyone interested in the logic of battle.
as described
I purchased this as something that i would look at over time to see the principles noted
 I know some business people who have read this so I was interested
 Its OK..
This was the real deal unlike some other for sale on Amazon
It makes a great gift for any history buff or any manly man
I recommend that everyone pickup this book
Well edited version of Sun Tzus writing
Product came as described and on time
No complaints.
Its an old book to that I was required to read
Its not something I would  pay to read again but worth the a first time read.
read read read just do
Read this as an assignment
Great read
Is still used as an aide for some military and businesses.
I thought this was the whole real book no its not its just quotes
Bamboozled dont buy
A very old book its content is taught in all our military war colleges
I first read this classic text in hard copy and purchased this kindle version to have as a ready reference
 I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the editing and formatting of this kindle edition
 This version contains no chapter stops and has numerous flaws including but not limited to inconsistent indentations Incomplete paragraph breaks and the use of  instead of proper horizontal line breaks
The text itself is little changed from the translation made a hundred year ago as I believe it should be
 My negative rating on this book is restricted to the poor presentation on kindle and if it is fixed and uploaded to my kindle I would be happy to change my rating.
I cant wait to read it
It came right on time along with some other ones that I ordered
Gift for a friend who loves itits a classic.
smart man great wisdom for any country or marriage
great read
Good read but needed to ask questions to get an understanding about his principals...Still growing lol
perfect
Nice font size well constructed paperback.
Chapter One is the most important after that its a bit monotonous
An interesting and quick short read.
While this books title suggests that its for war its been used in business for decades as the source for smart business leadership.
Exactly what I wanted.
challenged my perspectives
Always good to have a copy of this classic around
Just buy it
 Its that insightful and you can quickly apply its logical to just about any situation in your life.
One of the Classics
Great book and not adulterated by biased publishers
Small book more like a pamphlet but very well made and helpful.
Good reading that it can be related to every day life as how to treat people and what to spect from them
I have read and referenced this book several times in my life
If you are one of the few that have not read this it is time.
Exactly as described Very happy.
Very impactful well written and intelligent..
A good book for men women and older children  alike...
A MUST read..
Top notch.
This is not the real book its just a  pages of it or maybe not I have no idea
This is not the full book
Its only excerpts  thats not what I was looking for
For the price I expected the full book
I like the way its laid out and seems like a very good reproduction of a classic text.
Enjoyed it
Read it in small chunks at a time
Good advice that can be applied to the business world.
Must read for anyone serious
Just as advertised Happy with product
Historically significant and definitely worth reading.
Words to live by
Very informative and enlightening methods of war for that time in history.
Overall simple read
I would recommend to anyone
 Useful in life business war and romance
 Noticed a few typos and probably some mistranslations
 However nothing terribly distracting.
I found this book to be full of good advice that you can incorporate into your everyday life
within reason lol This book doesnt read like an ordinary book it reads like Proverbs.
Good overview of common sense military tactics
Often quoted in military circles yet not implemented as often as it should be
Book is alright just dated a little and probable should only be used as a primer or beginning step
The world may have changed a bit since this was written but the human element has not
Take this as a beginning step only
The book should be owned by every member of the military law enforcement salesmen and those that enter into negotiations.
just highlights of the original book
 very bland
A classic that I got for free with kindle
 For that price who could say no  Interesting little book that I read back in college.
Excellent Book gone Audio Cant get any better than this There is so much to learn in this book and now you can listen to it
I highly recommend reading this book.
Spot on
you figure it out
This is a must read for anyone going into a combat situation
Although written long ago thhe tactics of war and the rules of victory have not changed
This book is not only for the combat bound soldier many  of its faacts can be appllied to life in general.
A short read interesting
 Not a lot of depth
 But clear wisdom gathered by mistakes
The real deal
 Tons of good information to help you better understand what it takes to actually keep a fighting army in the field.
Nothing more nothing less than expected.
I was expecting this to be much longer
This is a series of excerpts
If youre looking for a more detailed translation of the full book go for the one by Ralph D
Sawyer.
Its a very old book...interesting read...but it has been around so long that you cant discredit its credentials as being a good book
Very interesting for someone with military experience.
Great classic book on strategy
Everyone should have a read of this at least once.
This is a classic and must read for high energy business people.
Good book
I bought out for my husband and he liked it.
One of the best books ever written
My husband loves this.
Expected the full book this is a summary of sorts
I should have checked the page count
Oops
Sunzi is a genius
 Run your life based on this book and you will come out on top or at least not get run over by the competition.
Replaced this book for one I had years ago and gave away.
This is  a great book able to be applied to most of life
Work family friends
I will certainly reread it.
Very practical tips that will last for ever.Knowing yourself is the essence of all wisdomand combine that with knowing your enemy to achieve success.
Enlightening war strategy
I dont read too many books anymore since my visions gotten worse  but this book is a must read for everyone
Just what I was looking for.
This is a very good read
I can recommend this to anyone that would like to gain the insights of Sunzi
Perfect transaction
Its a must read for anyone in military business or any leadership role
Actually everyone should read it.
this is a gift for an employee this is my favorite translation of the art of war
Hype Aside..
An interesting read from days of Oriental Yore
An amazing glimpse of that epoch.
Very good book
Greatest Combat book available
Standard reading in war colleges and always worth referring back to for understanding of warfare.
This is not the book by Sun Tzu
It is summary notes by someone who read it.
no blemishes thank you
Excellent product
Ready to go to war at the office with my friends or on the actual battlefield
A great book showcasing how to be victorious
What is best way to learn How about from the master if its good enough for officers in the military good enough for me.
This is not the actually book its just notes be aware
The information is awesome
 The writing is stiff and requires focus and determination to read
 A war bible for every walk of life.
too much history and too many forgettable names I was more interested in the meat of the philosophy of Sun Tzu
Insightful.
I can see that many that have done well throughout timestarted with many of the ideas in this book
Seriously it does not start that this is a summary  dont by this unless you want the notes
Another foray into the philosophy of war
 Still dont think it should be the way humanity continues to go when there are excellent alternatives
 Received in good condition.
Wanted to read this ever since I saw it mentioned on Thirtysomething.
Enlighten
I see this book as more of a philosophy
The contents can be applied to many situations in life not just war.
Excellent
Im going to be much more difficult to argue with now  GRRRRR
hard to read
A good read even if your not in business a book to read over again from time to time to gain insights and stratagies  for dealing with people in all aspects of life.
Timeless classic
 I learn something new every time I read it.
Great if you want to read one passage a day
It might be cheaper to buy a WUTANG cd and listen to one song a day.
This is not what I actually wanted and it is a bit childish but gets the point across
Learn to be the enemy
Simple and to the point.
A must read book for all strategists not just for soldiers and generals
 Use it in marketing management and even in love
This is a classic
Considering war as an art it goes much further
A real teaching on thinking
Timeless
A must.
Great book
ok
Its not hard to understand why this book is a classic
 The Art of War is the art of success.
Very abstract but a great book indeed.
I got this because it sounded good and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie
Besides a good classic is hard to pass up.
A classic.
Got this for my nephew
He is already changing his outlook
This is an absolute classic that any business man or woman should read.
Exactly as described  Great product shipping and all around experience  Highly recommend
This book has lots of practical advice for any who have an ear to hear it
 It is relatively short and the book is written in short tidbits that are easy to digest.
Thank you so much for the timely delivery
Thank you so much for the great service and great product A
The Art of War if youre going to buy it no comment or review is going to stop you
 Enjoy the book.
Great
great book and its great on the kindle
 i love how the kindle makes the books so interactive
 i definitely recommend the book.
Awesome feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too..
cant go wrong get this doit just do it
The format is NOT the best..
Content is OK
Id not buy it from Amazon again...
Great
great for business too
This is not the book it is a summary
A bad one
Not worth the money
A good and interesting read
The content is definitely applicable to multiple spheres of life
Leaders will greatly benefit from reading this book.
Didnt know I was ordering a shortened version 
As described and expected.
literary masterpiece for free on your mobile device if you complain you will just sound spoiled and dumb so dont
Love this book and would recommend for all especially managers.
Essential reading for those interested in military tactics
It reminded me again how tied we are to ancient ideas.
This was actually the first time I read this book Im very glad I got it and the ebbok format is very convenient.
The principles in this book can be applied to many areas of life
Solid book quick read
Would recommend to anyone.
Great Thanks
Great condition
Cheap and arrived in a timely fashion
The product is great and works well I would do business again with this seller.
Good
Bit disappointing compared to the quality of the ones I saw at BN and Costco after the purchase.
Thought this was the full book.
This book allows me to see things differently when it comes to handling small to big scale conflict.
thanks my son loves it
Great Book
Good to read on the train to and from home.
Classic book and it was free
 What else do people want
 Beggars cant be choosers thats what my Ma always said.
very good item like all SUnzi  products the quality of the materials give a you a mark of resistence and durability
Great
Much better than hardcover copy from book store
This is a satisfactory book but the translation could be more precisely done in English
The book is good enough for general information but I felt a little more background would have been of help.
You never know what tactic will come next
I originally purchased multiple copies of this translation as a goingaway present for a couple of coworkers and I was so impressed with the quality of the translation and the simple unembroidered way that it was presented that I am going to order an additional copy for myself within the next week.
Great read and relevant to todays world
Excellent Kindle version making all of this work readily accessible
 Thumbs up
Very wise tactical methods which stand the test of time.
ok
Nothing special here
Just a good bound version of an already classic work
For the price this is worth picking up and having in your literary arsenal.
Just needed a back up or extra to give someone works perfect.
this book is for everyone that wants to learn the art of strategy and organization
Although written for war the book can be easily used in everyday business situations
The only drawback with the book is it was written in Chinese so translation can sometimes seem a little confusing
Some parts I had to reread twice in order to understand what was being said.
This is a staple in his education
 He wants to go into the military and appreciates its references for school.
The Art of War read less about the acts of war and more how to conduct ones self in life matters
U Yes there are specific points of how to attack and from where but by the time it is completed it felt more like is was giving life lessons as well
I thought it odd and inspiring in a way that the author could merge these thoughts rather the solely concentrate on how to kill your enemy
Ill be reading it again.
Not the full book dont waste your money
Thought there was more to it.
Short sweet and to the point
 Very useful in business
 I love the audio book and the written book
 I would buy it again.
I was taking a philosophy class at college and had to write some papers
These proved to be helpful during the class.
About what I expected
Interesting reading
great book 
Good bookliked reading  ...
Bought for my  year old sonhe had to read it for school and he loved it
He said it was the best book.
The only downside of this book is the fact that every newly minted MBAturd quotes it.
I use this book to defeat all of my enemies and so far I have destroyed them all  Works best as a club from behind
Makes you think of life and how society has came a long way
These ideas are the foundation for years to come.
This book is very helpful for students studying political science history business criminal justice or even understand terrorism
The Art of War was mentioned numerous times in my understanding terrorism course and is very helpful to understand techniques that guerrilla and terrorist groups have used from the book.
Recommend for anyone that wants to learn about the military ideas or plans that are required to win a war.
Pleased with the service and product.
Timeless reading never outdated
This book is a way to learn how to deal with other and life itself
Its for school
Life wisdom....great book.
great book
A classic
Very helpful I all walks of life.
An alltime classic on strategy
 I found the new content to be somewhat esoteric and just skipped all the parts in the brackets.
Excellent
One of the greatest books I have ever read on strategy and tactics
I really like it.
These are the only brand I will use
 They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
Only  pages long
Not the real book.
not the real book just an over priced cliff notes bur it did arrive quickly
Interesting read you can learn some things from it.
Basis of practically all military policies throughout history.
Very happy with this book no regrets money well spent
Should have bought this books months ago
Nothing like a good book .
I thought it was the original thick book but it was the new short book
very nice book.
Great book  excellent gift.
This is the bible on warfare and it is timeless Small but great book
Im very glad its still available.
Really just a bunch of quotes its an alright book but nothing to wow me.
Great book glad I finally replaced my original copy.
thanks
Very nice read applicable to setting strategy and tactics whether in war sports business or politics
 I found it meaningful to identify analogies for some of the truths that are outdated.
Rip off This is not the full book
Great Book 
Very good book for moving your life along in a positive way
A good read for anyone.
Great book quick read thats very interesting.
Already good at the beginning
The points are valid.
I read it to help me with my poker game
It can be helpful in any type of leadership role.
Good advice for anyone
Applicable for everyday life.
Classic.
I have to agree with the review that I read before I purchased the book
The author really does not know when to shut up
 The Art of War and other works from Asia allow me to recommend Go Rin No Sho by Miyamoto Musashi really benefit from some perspective and discussion from the translator
 I get that
This guy has to interject his thoughts right in the middle of the source work
Often his thoughts are many times longer than the text that is the focus of his ramblings
But dont be dissuaded from taking on this master piece because of this after a few moments you will learn how to skip the blather the first quarter of the book and then sometimes     pages at a time and read the book as translated
 On the second read through maybe the third  go ahead and enjoy what our author has to share
His perspective is not bad  but the book is an editorial nightmare.
Nice to have on kindle fire.
This was too short and was misleading it did not indicate the length of the CD
 The original book is very lengthy.
good reading for the mind.
Excellent.
Classic Novel that should be read by anyone looking for an advantage in life
Great deal for the price
This is an amazing book  It has lived up to all of my expectations
 My husband hates to read but he read this book and loved it  Very very Good Book.
Good
This very condensed version of Sun Tzus The Art of War would be better as a pocket version for quick reference.
This is not the original Art of War by Sun Tzu as I thought it was and the picture indicates.
Good book.
I am kind of torn on how many stars to give this as the product itself the audio book is great but the actual content is retarded
Sun Tzu spouts off a bunch of useless crap like If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy you will lose the leader of your first division and only half your force will reach the goal
If you march thirty LI with the same object twothirds of your army will arrive
Thank you Sun Tzu for summarizing war into neat little equations for us Function for computing losses during outmaneuver operation Fx  if x   then  leader and 
of force else if x  
then 
of force
Good book.
everyone needs to read
very helpful
fast shipping item is exactly as described
One of the greatest books of all time.
Good Book.
This should be required reading for anyone over the age of 
Buy it now read it and apply it in everyday life.
How to win your battles well earned and spy on the enemy and is great for tactics of ying and yang
The Art of War provides a timeless framework for evaluating adversaries in conflicts.
Do not buy the Filiquarian Publishing version
 The translation is poor as well as the editing
 It reminds me of reading unintelligible assembly instructions for foreign products You will not enjoy reading this book
It is a great book but not this version.
Exactly what I wanted it
Very good item and soon shipping.
I always go back to read this book recommended by my son love it is one of my leadership book that I use a lot of quotes from.
It is the book all business people need
It show simple ideals  to simple situation for everything I recommend it to all
Contains several incorrect quotes misattributed to Sun Tzu.
read before entering west point
Came really fast and in good condition.
An ebook the should be in everyones library and read frequently.........
Interesting easy and fast paced read

Timeless classic for understanding the daily struggle of humanity otherwise known as life
Thank you

I dunno man its a book what do you want me to say
The translation is nice not much lost in the translation
The condition of the book is great and fast shipping.
Great book for a great price
When you can find literature like this for free you cant help but download it.
very good service and product
good book can apply it to many different aspects of life
Lost interest and didnt finish boring dry dull it on to put back it it it iti it it it
a must read
alotta the tactics r already in place in our country with all the diversionary tactics in this book.
I did not read this book but my husband had read it many years ago and was looking for a copy
 He says there are many good concepts in this book.
spine broken
Great book written thousands of years ago but all its concepts still applies to warfare as well as business today
A wonderful book to learn from past ages strategy that is timeless
My year old son asked for Christmas
I guess college is helping
Great book  A must read for everyone
Classic what else to say
I own at least  copies.
Was exactly as stated.
Really enjoy this book A classic
I made it through
Thats all we can ask for from my very limited reading skills
Have a good year
Amazing book must read classic
It is a little shorter than I expected but a great book none the less.
good book and story and best of all free what more could you want free everyone should read great for collage and military
Interesting Read
Contains Much Wisdom
Sun Tzu Is Brilliant
Exactly as described.
Good read
Good addition to the library.
Hard to understand
What you see is what you get great product the same as in the detail I recommend this Item to everyone.
Audio is a bit stiff but the book is great.
Most people go through life using tactics
While Sun Tzu does give great tactical advice he also show in this book that having an overall strategy is the key to success
 It is a military guide but after all isnt life a war  Great book and if can learn to apply to your world youll find yourself with a very different outcome than usual
 Success for the long run.
Purchased for a class and it was exactly what I needed.
I enjoyed reading this simple and to the point translated version of the book
The translated text of The Art of War means that the meaning of the words have further been interpreted for the English language
It allows therefore the reader to interpret also the words for the modern day context of daily life.
It was good reading
Short and concise for the price.
I cant get my husband to join me using this product with an e reader
With the book its great
i thought it would be better but it is still a good read.
This is one of those classic must read books
It has been around for ages and for good reason too.
Great product.
amazing price
Good
Dont remember a thing about this book.
A gift and it was used not much else to say if you like the book this will be used
as expected
A very insightful book that can be taken metaphorically as well as literally
This books reads in a number format that simply gives tips on warfare.
Who doesnt love this book
it should say in the title that this is a small version without commentary
only  pages or so.
Well packaged fast delivery
Thx.
This book is a necessary read for all students of history
 This is a manual for life read it carefully to digest all that is written
 Because it is ancient and translated it may be a little difficult to understand at first but take your time and enjoy Rev
Sandra Spencer Abbey of Avalon
Gave as a gift to my wife and she loved it.
This book is a definitely must read
Each statement makes you think.
Excellent bare bones version of the classic
 No commentary etc
 Just the original book
I have read or attempted to read several versions and this is one of the best lay outs that I have read.
Actuallyits enough to attract me.
This was a written around the th or th century B.C
by Sun Tzu one of the most powerful Chinese generals of that era
Spoken basically like proverbs he gives a general overview of conducting war
I didnt care for the commentaries that went with it but I absolutely LOVED the thoughts of Sun Tzu
Not only does it open your eyes to the fact that warfare is more than what occurs on the battlefield but also the tactic that the enemy uses against us.
Very pleased
I consider this book because fundamentals of war it describes is on point
As I am reading I visualized the plots taking place
When I was I reading the book drew me in and I wanted more.
We love it just what we ordered.
Great book
A pure masterpiece written by arguably the greatest military mind that ever has walked this planet
I will read his over and over.
great book
War
When to do it why to do it how to do it
A step by step instruction manual on how to wreak havoc and influence people
If you enjoy war as much as I do this is a must read.
Good philosophy to follow.
I cant really review books that well since books come in various tastes but if youre looking to catch up on the classics for fun or  because its on your bucket list Id strongly recommend you pick this up.
Good reading to fill a few minutes here and there
 How can you complain about a free ebook  
GREAT BOOK
DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER  GREAT PRICE
Must have
Great history book
A classic
The foreword is a wonderful read.
good read
Meh I thought most of this was just common sense.
Tried a couple other well known versions of Sun Tzus book and they dont stand up to Claves edit.
Its the art of war
Book ended up being just the cliffnotes I though I was getting the whole book
 Probably missed that in the product description
 It still let me get a decent idea of what the book was about but it was a pretty quick read.
Great book as a gift
Its Sun Tzu...
Excellent summary of warfare
 Today tomorrow and yesterday.
 Cheap binding  Cheap paper  Poor translation  Typesetting looks like it was done in Notepad  Lots of grammatical errors  Paragraphs not laid out correctly I bought this for my father as a Christmas gift and was taken aback at the low quality of this product
Seems like it was selfpublished or similar
Would NOT recommend.
Must read for business
Great advice for today.
Ive read it six times
Each time I get something out of it.
Kind of a dry read for my taste but with good content
Many items are there for review and application to extended ideas.
Ok but dated.
Its not an accident that this wisdom has been passed down through the ages
The philosophy can be applied to just about any area of life
Very good experience  


would defintely order from Vendor again 
 






.
Found it for free  not really an easy read but a good read.
The introduction is the best part of this book
I think thats the closest you can get to a biography of Sunzi so thats good
But the book itself is very confusingly formatted
The organization is completely unclear it does not read like a text so much as a list
There are so many additions and footnotes that it is not clear where Sunzi ends and where  Cleary begins.
A Classic
 Rereading it is always a gaining of new insights.
While reading the art of war I immediately realized the influence this book has said not only in military strategy but also in business
The strategies mentioned in the book has been repeated throughout history and I enjoyed that the Chinese General was very straightforward in good descriptions
No sugar coding no complex metaphors is all black and white and its up to the reader to form hisher opinion on it
Im positive many corporate tycoons used the strategies for corporate takeovers and countries have used the book as a way to win wars and sack cities
This can be pretty dangerous season in the wrong hands so I recommend anyone in a leadership position to delve into this short but concise book for a few hours.
Exactly what I paid for
read it again  easy in my spare time on my phone
I would recomend this to anyone who wants to succeed in anything they do It is not just about lessons in war but can be used and applied for everyday life
Great buy God bless
Great product
 Exactly as described
 Fast shipping

THUMBS UP
Good book better versions are available on Amazon though.

Excellent word and tactics to live and fight for.
Still a modern reference for the psychology of war.
Great so far
Must read for everyone.
Great read
Good book to compare modern military theory to the past.
good
Like tink
Dont be an idiot
Just read this book.
Love love love these books.
Some great advice in here
The whole book is literally aphorism after aphorism.
Every military person should read this
I may have ordered the wrong version of this book because it was not at all what I expected.
I received Thomas Clearys translation of Sun Tzus Art of War in a trouble free very timely fashion for a great price
 When it arrived I found the book in excellent condition which is good as I bought the book brand new
 Overall I couldnt be happier with the purchase.
Good resource for most Social Studies Classrooms
Good book about strategy.
I am a military person and I have read it many times
 Every time I read it I find information that I that I have not found before.
Poor attempt
As advertised
Would buy from seller again.
A Great Book to read

soso............I found the syntax boring
Its hard to recommend this book enough
A must read for everybody.s
Great read
Bought The Art of War paperback as part of a stocking stuffer set
Did not realize my son has a Hard Bound copy from years ago
He still loves this one as he can take it when he has to go somewhere he knows hell have to sitstand and wait.
My expectations were met
What would Sun Tzu think about his book being rated on Amazon He would probably have something really wise to say.
Have read before several times and given away my copy
 This one will Be kept and given to s grandson when old enough
 The world is not all seashells and balloons and critical thinking needs to be taught
Everyone should have a copy of this classic around to glance at occasionally
 I suspect it still is a textbook at West Point.
Really good book i have read it so many times
The Arts should be studied
all good
It is a wellwritten book
 You will learn a lot.
Very straightforward edition
 Nice layout easy to read.

A MUST READ
good book would recommend this to anyone to read
very interesting subject have read a couple times now
hard to put down
This book is relevant for todays tactics
The principles are timeless
This book should be required reading for anyone in leadership.
A good read.
A very interesting read
Can be a little stale if you arent into tactics on the battlefield
Otherwise a nice treatise on the tactics used in war during Sun Tzus time.
Good all around.
Great book for life  business.
One of the best strategic books Ive ever read in my life The lessons in this book are applicable to every aspect in life.
A must read.
An easy read with a lot of sensible information
Helps to give insight for strategic actions that may be employed in both life and war.
I was very surprised that the story for the most part is mostly intact
 How hard is it to get the Art of war right  I did feel that some of the softening of the language was not necessary and I believe a strait translation would have gone a long way in bringing this book back to the iconic level it has enjoyed all these years.

its a book
Its alright
I consider it a good beginning but further reading required
Warfare is a subject  more complex than meets the eye
Theres no substitute for experience.
Great Book
Printing quality average very short read
Do not buy
Table of contents is mixed around and the actually content is not the real book just bullet points for several chapters.
THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING WORK
 I THINK IT REFLECTED NOT ONLY ON WAR BUT ON HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES AND RELATE TO LIFES SITUATIONS AND CHALLENGES
 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
AN EASY READ WELL DIVIDED BY CHAPTERS AND PARAGRAPHS.
Dont want to write a review.
This isnt a book
Its a handbook
Reference material to be used when conducting warfare
Sun Tzu was thousands of years ahead of his time
Anybody with even a remote interest in military tactics needs to read this book.
U can appley these lessons in every day life
The lessons in this book will give u disipline in every walk of life
Sun Tzu teachings are timeless

Ok
Great read
Should if it isnt already be required reading for all college students
The Art of War is a suggestive manual on combat by Sun Tzu that can easily be looked upon as a guide in the world today.
Cant beat the classics.
It has some colourful use of language and some of the leadership principles might intrigue you but mostly its just outdated war principles and following most of whats in here in real life would be silly.
Great Product Thank You
Bah
The book you read when you want to understand conflict.
Is it only me who finds the translation of this book is nonsense I might have bought the wrong version.
solid read
good book.
The pictures others have posted do not match my book
The book I received is stupidly short
Its Sunzi...you cant go wrong
The book is a short version of the actual one but it seems to jump around too much and lacks a description of whats going on.
A surprisingly quick read.
Basic warring techniques adopted all over the world.
He really knew how to win
A Classic and deservedly so.
Classic for a reason.
This is a pretty brutal read
There may be really good parts to this but as far as reading this from front to back good luck with that
Fun and informative.
Thanks the product arrived on time
Awesome and classic book
Bought for my son as a gift
Fast shipping cover looked brand new
Excellent read.
Its The Art of War of course its good and for the Kindle price its well worth it
Paid for this and it was never delivered.
evryone should have copy
Good stuff
This is my rd time reading art of war it is fantastic in every way
I recommend this book to all people.
Great Quick read
Good but not the best translation.
Very satisfy with the content of the book
Great item Great Price Amazon does it again...
I never have to leave the house to shop again
thank you
awesome book.
Good product
Rating says it all
The worst part of this book is that the print is off center and lopsided like it wasnt printed correctly
If youre like me then you can look past that and just enjoy the book which is entirely legible
Also the book has no printing on the end...which makes it hard to see on a book shelf
Not that big of a deal to me because I know where it is and lets honest...thats all that matters If however you are one of those pretentious douchebags that likes showing off just cultured you are you might want to go with a copy that someone might enter your room see it and think to them self gee I hope their greatness rubs off on me.
Excellent book
It arrived on time
Came quickly and it will make a great gift for my teenage son.
standard   useful  timeless wisdom
Different from what I expected and loved the strategies
Shows me that everything has to be analytical in business war or any other thing
Good
Highly recommend this
I have study the art of war from a tv point of view never read the book from this author I did look at a page or so and I thinks any and everyone who deals with life can learn from this book and help them with life problems and situations
if the book meet what I seen on tv it will meet my expectations  and more
  thanks for reading my review and more
Very enlightening...
Loved it
Great book...Great seller
good read
A must read for everyone.
Dood This is like..
TOTALLY a copy of The Art of War by Sun Tzu
Totally
It was a very short read with many war strategies that can be applied to typical daily decisions we all encounter
More enriched from reading this book.
The first quarter of the book is all introductions and someones essay on the life of Sun Zhu
The rest of it you have to suffer through the editors notes and opinions ever other paragraph
I would rather pay to not have to deal with it than to get it free and suffer through it
I expect it to be a good read and nothing against the book but those version is garbage.
Hard read Great strategic planning when it comes to war planning can be useful in so many ways outside of war
Business leagal matters etc
Worth the hour it took to read
excellent
Delivered as expected
I mean there was a lot of hype surrounding this book but I found it to be very cryptic
 Yes if you really think about it you can make sense of what the author was saying
 I feel like a wealthy famous individual say said this book was great so other people said it was great which started a trend..
I bet if the Kardashians all the fashion bloggers in the world would post a pic with this book saying they loved it
 Buy the book for looks people love to ask about it when they see it not to read.
Everything as advertised...
A timeless classic...
This book was forced on me by Kindle
There is no way to remove it so it sits here taking up space
Amazons response We will let the developers know
There are  books that came with the Kindle app that I cannot remove in total
None are useful or interesting.
This book was for my veteran son and he thoroughly enjoys and learns from the teachings of the book
 He has already gone through the battle blown up and thank God survived
 This book not only teaches skills of war but skills of life.

AMAZING BOOK.
Many who I have spoken to have only seen this book as a military guide
 This is not the case strategy is usable in all aspects of life and after reading this I gained a better understanding of how some things within the world work
 A great business strategy guide.
good
not as in depth as expected
Excelent.
the classic.
good book with notes
Just what I needed
Its a good read that can be applied to life
Especially in the work place but it may take some think as to how to apple some tactics.
This book is a poorly edited and completely plagiarized copy of Clavells work
 I read the first page discovered more spelling errors than you could imagine and noticed almost immediately it was almost a word for word copy of Clavells edition of THE ART OF WAR
 I sent it back the same day
Amazon was great about it.
Acceptable.
Free download
It is what it is
Simply affordable and digestable
If you spend  hour you are able to complete it with ease
I caution however you have to read the content and try to see how you can apply it in your own lives.
I bought this for my son and he loves it.
This book is very interesting.
Simple and Clear
Good book
Amazing book.
This was a brief overview of the actual book
The cheap price was due to the fact that it isnt the actual book.
All good
good
Still reading it
 its a quick read but have not had much time
I see this as a template for many interpersonal processes as well
 Meaning modulate the ideas and can be useful with interpersonal relations as well.
Great book
loved it
pretty good book has many things that translate into real life
Nice
This is a masterful book and will provide sound advice for any battle in your life you might face no matter how big or small
ok

A classic read
Very interesting ideas
Its quick and to the point and will leave you with lots of new knowledge that you can use in life.
The strategies in this book can be used in modern life
The author was an excellent thinker
Great book to reference.
Its an interesting book that was written in something like  BC
 This is considered a loose translation of the original and has been condensed down into basic understandings about how to win wars
 It would be a quick read
 Its a brutal topic imo.
Expensive
Book comes as described
Great book 
A classic
Must have.
good book
Sometimes it was a bit confusing but it still holds true for today
This just goes to show that the art of war never changes only the technology that we use to get the same outcome.
Not its best translation
 I felt something was missing.
Written thousands of years ago still true today as it was then
Well translated and interesting
Highly recommended even though war as a whole is discouraged 
great
everyone should read this if only for the modern day references
 The simplicity and common sense approach can appear boring until you apply it to other areas of your life.
On time delivery arrived just as advertised.
A must read for someone in the business world.
Good Book
liked it
This translation isnt the best but it definitely gets the point across for a low price.
ok
Delivered as promised
Awesome book
Great

Bill Belichick recommended
I give this book  Rings.
Very good book to learn strategy.
art of war is a very important book and is a must read
Every manlyman should have read this by now.
THIS IS THE SHORTENED VERSION
I thought the book will be thick but its waay thinner than I thought btw the book is good.
good item
It was a wonderful book.
This is a must read for anyone in sales and business
A true classic...apply it to daily living and winning strategies
Short and simple a metaphor of life
Thank you.
Do not purchase this is a knock off version The Art of War book is a word processed copy of the book with errors
Excellent
Good read
Analogies could be drawn to various aspects of business and competitive strategies if read with some thought process.
Great
Perfect
Everyone in the military civilian business sector as well as mentors and coaches should read this book
The information relayed in this book can and should be implemented throughout all aspects of leadership training.
Very inspiring
Would really recommend if you ever were to pick a fight be a politician or any hobby that requires you to have an enemy.
many typos
Loved this book
Generic paperback.
ok
Brilliant man whose ancient tactics still stand today and can be applied to many different arenas from business to marketing to sport.
AWESOME
Good
Arrived looking and smelling like a brand new book
Obviously a great collection in this book
You can dispute the greatness of Art Of War
Nothing I can say will add to its historical importance...too many different philosophies.
One of the must read books on my list
good book
I like the tactics of management in this book
The Art of War audio book is read by B.D
Wong and Ron Silver
 Ron Silver has a really calm yet serious reading voice.
Sun Tzu often wrote about the importance of strategy and the wisdom that he shared is still extremely applicable today whether youre referring to business sports or military endeavors.
Im winning already
nice
if you want to succeed in this world you need to read and  practice what is written in this book
Very recommended book easy to apply to present time
Great insights about a great leader and qualities to lead people.
cool super nice reader and easy ro to follow good translation into English I enjoy this book
great book to read
This translation has many typos and errors
Very sloppy
Find a different translation for this excellent text
I purchased this book as a gift
 However it is a wonderful  instrumental read for those of us who prefer peace than war.
Chapter  was in the wrong place in the book instead if in between  and  it was in between four and .
Very Informative Book
Would Recommend That You Buy it
Information In Here Is Very Valuable
enjoyed it 
Enjoyed it
Recommended to business students
Wasnt what I was expecting the book is just a list of quotes
However Im glad to have read it and can mark it off my list
I think this book could have been translated better.
I had always heard of this and finally got to read it
 very interesting
I heard that it is still used today and understand why
He is as much shrink as warrior.
this is a good translation of the art of war.
Not what I expected
Maybe let others know this is a very abbreviated cliffnotesversion of the book
Great read.
A must read for anyone interested in strategy
Its a classic
Love being able to read on the go
The ease of the kindle is so nice
Would definitely recommend to buy.
The book is based on opinion of translations
Okay I dont really know what I was expecting but I did not find it
I dont think I was expecting so much regurgitation of the orginal material.
I believe that our civilization is advanced beyond the need for war
This book is one of my best arguments against war.
love having this on my phone
THE GREAT CLASSIC IS PROUDLY IN MY LIBRARY ONCE ADAIN
THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO WISHES TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIER DESTINY
SUN TZU STRATEGIMS ARE AS TIMELES TODAY AS WHEN THEY WERE WRITTEN.THIS CLASSIC HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO MORE THAN  LANGAGUES AND IS PART OF THE CURRICULUM IN EVERY MILITARY SCHOOL THAT CONSIDERS ITSELF A VIABLE MILITARY.
A Classic read
love it
book is perfect fast shipping thanks so much
i have been searching for this item for quite some time
finally found it here at amazon
as describedfast shipping exactly what i was looking for very nice item thanks so much
very interesting
The book was not bad but I felt it was a little short.Maybe the purchase price should have reflected this
I noticed many different versions of this book and with so little old script in hindsight I would go for a lower priced copy.
What a great way to get books
Great read for those who follow the way of Bushido
Incredible
Enjoy this book
Soft cover like  pages not book
Written over two thousand years ago in a time when wars were fought with chariots this book offers succinct advice for military commanders
It reminds me of Machiavellis The Prince which offers succinct advice for rulers
Both books are brief
Both books offer astute and sometimes provocative guidance
Both books derive additional interest from their historical importance
But I found The Art of War by far the easier read part of a single afternoon whereas for me The Prince was hard going
Two quotes to give a flavor of the book All warfare is based on deception
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting
I highly recommend this book but not this specific edition which appears to use the Lionel Giles translation without bothering to credit Mr
Giles deceased he may be but he deserves acknowledgment
Moreover the edition lacks an introduction to provide historical context and the ninth chapter has been moved forward without explanation.
Buy a different version
The person who wrote this ruined the book
Im still trying to find a better version.
Great Informative Powerful Thoughtprovoking Read My son said he could not put the book down and continues to read it repeatedly.
This is a great book that covers strategies for more than just warfare
Very concise and top the point
Easy to read
If you want to learn more about war and different strategies then this book is for you
These tactics are still being used today for a reason
A must have for all that love learning about war and battles.
Great book
Everyone should read this at least once in their lifetime
Much to much background
A lot of he said she said by the author that overwhelms Sunzi
Many people have mentioned his sayings yet one has to pick through the bale of hay to find those needles of wisdom so delicately placed.
Puts things in perspective.
Dr
Giles translation is excellent for academics sinophiles and those attempting to Sun Tzus principles to endeavors unrelated to military purposes
It is not as useful for the fields for which it was intended however those being the military and intelligence fields
Readers from those professions are better served by the translations by Griffith or Sawyer who share more relevant insights than the less experienced Giles.
great book
For work or play the theory espoused is on the money
This book met all my expectations and lived up to the promotions voiced by a coworker
 I would recommend it to a friend.
Not well described
Like the book just thought it would have more pages but an easy read
Im not a solder but I am an intercessor in prayer
 Some times it helps to understand how your enemy works and or thinks
The Devil is the enemy of all man kind
 I use this book in prayer to fight for my family country and for the peace of Israel.
Inexpensive copy great for quick reading and reference but you can tell that no care or thought was put into this product for example chapter IX appears before chapter V...
A Classic
This book is loaded with lots of information
All of it is thought provoking
Worth the read if you have an extra couple hours.
Pretty interesting read especially if youre into strategy like me.
Fast and Flawless shipping Book is in great condition and I especially like the slightly larger fonts makes for easy reading
Great Product
The book The Art of War was in excellent condition and the purchase process was easy
I would recommend this to anyone interested in the book.
Great
One of the books I always like to come back to and read it again and again
SO many practical advises for so many real situations
Great.
Should be mandatory teaching early on in schools.
This book was not an easy read I was a litle bored by the way it was written but then what should one expect of notes created many hundreds of years ago
 Many of Sunzis concepts are still valid today.
If you ever want to learn of war strategy and chinese culture this is the book to read
I really enjoyed it
A good read
Not sure how to apply the information yet.
i will probably buy another text with interpretation of the original as i would like an opinion of how it applies to real life and or business life and strategies.
I enjoyed it.
This is the Art of War however you have interjections and what not throughout the text with kind of sucks but you have to remember that youre getting the book for free so you can just skip all the other crap and it is crap
I read the first half of that crap so I can see why so many people are mad at it
Just skip it and read Suns words it isnt too hard to do when you have a kindle.
Its a art
Truly timeless and a legitimate must in anyones library these writings can be applied to numerous parts of anyones life.
Outstanding read all should partake in
Perfect and quick
It applies today as well.
must read
Its ok not as comprehensive as some versions but its a good smaller version of the more detailed readings
it summarizes well.
one of the easiest interpertations I have read
I enjoyed it very much
The thinking strategy can be applied to almost anything in life especially if competiton is involved.
Lot of ancient wisdom in this little book
I will definitely refer to it .
this is more commentary than the actual Art of War
Its remarkable how hard it is to find a simple copy of the Art of War everyone wants to pollute it with their thoughts and clarifications  unnecessary
Do not recommend.
Very stragetic book good for the mind
Recommend this book to friends and family
like the book because it was straight to the point.
you can get this on the internet for free but its nice to have it on book form
I had no idea how much I would enjoy this book
Sun Tzu was a wise man and I think there is a lot to learn from him
Even though I do not plan on starting any wars anytime soonor ever
Read it.
Great classic
Sun Tzu was a military master who understood the Art of War of his time and his territory.
good deal
It is a great read
Very useful for business and life
every one should read this book and keep it handy
Great
Great book
Great book
Great book and information for those of us that move strategically and think critically....
Will be a difficult read but is a gem
It wasnt the actual book just footnotes
Free book Free book Free book Free book Free book Free book Free book Free book Free book seriously nothing wrong with a free book
This is a public domain translation
There is no preface introduction or extra frills of any kind
For the dirt cheap price this book is a steal
Shipping was fast and convient
The book itself is a short book about  chapters  pages or so but its a good book
I thought this would be the full edition
 What I received was a condensed version with excerpts
 Not at all what I expected.
First time purchase of a book on disk and I will be doing it again
Easy listening and done in a manner that makes you what to continue to go on
The price is fair and the delivery was fast.
Have been wanting to read this for a long time finally..
Simple almost poetic very appropriate considering the state of things.
great
As relevant today as BC
Thought this was the full book it wasnt.
The book was described in enough detail that I knew I was ordering the exact edition that I needed and the condition was exactly what I was looking for in a book
Delivery was very fast and the price was the best I was able to find
I hear repeatedly about how this book should be read if you are interested in the subjects of national security or simply to get an understanding of current world events
 These recommended reading lists should be updated as there are many far better books on the theory or aggression mechanics and psychology of troop movements and battle and theory of war
 The complexity of our current socioeconomic arena and how the world responds often defies explanation utilizing historic strategies and theories.
Fantastic 
Shortened version  not apprentice from description.
Just covers the basics
Great classic
No complains since I got this for free
Always a good book to have in your library for reference.
Great book
Arrived in great condition
Pretty dry really
Likely a good read for new andor youthful military enthusiasts.
The military still studies this book today
 To bad the politicians didnt have it during Viet Nam it seemed that Gen Giap had it and used it succesfully.
I bought this for a gift
 They loved it
Without trying to give a spoiler this book is a self help of sorts that helps you to view different situations in life in general from a different perspective and in so doing help you think of ways to overcome andor cope with them
This version is smaller than I expected and the quality of the print was pretty good no blurred lines or strangely angled letters
Good read highly recommend.
It is easy to see why this book has become required reading for so many senior military officers
 It has stood the test of time like none other
 I highly recommend it for military and civilians alike.

Good read
HARD TO UNDERSTAND ALOT OF IT
THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL BOOK I rated this five stars to help make others aware of a glaring issue with this product and to help project the voice of those who rated it one star and had this similar issue
This listing fails to show within the description that this is the abridged version of the book unfortunately I wasnt aware of that and for a quick summary of what the actual book has to offer this does the job but shame on the seller for not clarifying what people are purchasing.
Essential read classic.
Great book to get into reading again and very well formatted
This book will change how you look at a lot of the situations that regularly drive you crazy during the course of the day.
I love this book
It is very simple and easy to read
I can grasp the concept reasily
Thanks a bunch
This book is straight forward and understandable
A surprising amount of the advice can be applied today  to nonmilitary circumstances.
Great
Good book
Brilliant tactician.
Was a great price and was in perfect condition
Never received this
I was excited to received book
 Started reading where chapter IV should begin is chapter IX
 So it chapter    
 Going to order another book again I guess
 Thanks.
This copy of mine arrived just a few minutes ago and I havent gone as far as read the contents but the translation looks pretty easy to understand the chapter divisions seems neat and I cant wait to read it
 What makes me give this a two star is the condition of my book when it arrived
 It looks like it has been bent and its not smooth at all
There are very visible cracks at the back cover and not only one or two cracks there are a LOT of them
Im expecting some quality stuffs from Amazon and this is my first time purchasing something from you but looks like you didnt quite treat my package well huh
And to think I chose the second best shipping for my package
I guess I gotta rethink my next purchases from this website
Im disappointed.
The quality of this product is pretty satisfying
It is very good price and the thing I liked the most was the speed of delivery
It arrived  times faster than expected so it is good.
I read this book and realized that in todays world this book could apply to dealing with people in the boardroom as well as the battle field
I reread it constantly
Great book and awesome delivery.
Had a copy lost it...this is nice
This book is timeless and will always have reread value
It came in great condition and without delay
I would recommend to anyone who likes to read books that can be applied to real life situations.
ok
So good and informative I ordered this for a friend going into politics
And excellent guide to the basics of military organization and general life practices
A must read work if ever Ive seen one.
The commentaries in between each paragraph can be annoying to read through before the actually paragraph is finished
It might be amazons ridiculous design that ruins the literature because the original text is inspiring.
A must for any leader.
In this book each passage by Sun Tzu is immediately followed by several different interpretations of that passage
 It is difficult to read because the book is so broken up by other translators
 Very annoying.
Great translation
Very smooth and easy to read
Recommend for anyone looking to transform an ancient acumen into a business advantage.
Classic book came quick in great condition
Excited to read
Shorter than expected.
Its all here and effectively translated but features several juvenile typos that lend a jarring immaturity to this type of text.
Very good on many levels.
The recipient of this gift reported that it was an interesting book
It arrived on time and well packed
History lovers should enjoy this book.
Read the item description carefully
This book is only  pages long and only highlights important parts of the book not well.
The foundation of eastern strategic thought
This book is very useful if you are playing a strategic war game or planning on joining a military Not to mention that this teaches you useful vocabulary and tactics
All in all great In my opinion
The person rewriting this classic piece of work adds in too much of his own commentary
It makes for difficult reading in regards to when sunzi is instructing and when this rewriter is commenting
It was like reading books.
Great book from beginning to end very good book
I would recommended to everyone to read it would not regret it.
dont buy this
its not what you think
Good and short
I think it will serve me most playing Rome Total War
In real life mmmm Well I guess having the mentality in ones back head can be of good use.
Fails in storytelling lists his philosophies in concise points giving no context whatsoever but what more can you expect in  pages book on this topic.
good edition
This was a short book read quickly
 My husband and I read it together and we both found it informative
 Its classic and the principles can be applied to various areas of your life not just physical war.
Really enjoyed the concepts the author presented they can be applied to many of lifes challenges
It is a book to keep for reference.
nuff said
Every American war fighter should be required to study this.Its ancient wisdom.
A very good read
Easy read
Great book for people who want a strategy book
It has many complicated words and sometimes you have to think about what he means or is trying to say.
The editing of the book is lousy
Not a lot of pages
Not the book you think is  pages there could be different versions
Not the original book.....a SALE BOOK
Thought it was the full version but good as a clarification or supplement to the full book.
Great book good insight for leadership and influential people.
Not interesting at all boring rather
Strategic
Written  years ago this book is fanatastic and eery but full of insight with wise perspective
Highly reccomended to everyone
Highly recommended
 Thanks to Sun Tsu I can deal with conflict from a knowledgable position
 I look back and see some of my shortcomings and failures and see I could have been successful had I this information.
Nc
Reading this text through the lens of Christian doctrine has shown that many archetypal beliefs exist among men of faith
Within this text the man of war is presented as a welldisciplined and wise individual who abhors war
For him war is the last option and not the first
This ancient book of wisdom contrast with the practices of many modern world leaders
The translators introduction often references the  Tao te Ching which might also be excellent reading for the man of faith who hopes that the can communicate his beliefs with others who have a background in Eastern philosophy  Corinthians 
If sustained peace ever enters this modern era it will come from the body of faithful peaceful and welldisciplined men
Much like Gideon and other Biblical accounts the text states that the greatest warrior can win a war without fighting a battle
Unfortunately this text often is read by greedy powerhungry individuals who do not seek peace and are misled by the title
The teachings which I contains can be used for good or evil
With this text one can heal difficult situations or promote anarchy as the modern physician can heal or kill with prescription medicine
This is a powerful text and excellent reading.
Great book
Classic work of literature if not this edition find another one that works.
If you dont have this book in your library well get one now
Its really essential for dealing with modern life.
I purchased this book on the assumption that it would be just as good as any other printing of the same title
However it seems that the formatting of the book is very poorly done
Bullet points and lists are simply listed out in a single paragraph and there is no apparent effort to make the ideas visually clear
I would steer clear of this printing and invest in a betterpresented edition of the book.
This is a great book for those young fresh commanders who are looking for advice I would recommend this book to any and all commanders
Love it
Taught me a lot about battle Strategies.
product came in very great condition
Or perhaps this is simply horse sense But refined by an acute mind
Also a fascinating glimpse of a bygone period
Truly enjoyed
Learnt so much.
this IS my bible
 ever since i first read it in  I keep a copy on me at all times.
An inspirational book for strategists.
Rating got of  because of the total knowledge that is produced by the original text
How it relates to life in society as we know it
Great buy
Helped me to understand why the Trump Administration won the election
I expected the art of war book this is not the book this is the notes added to the book
I wouldnt have bought it if I knew.
great book
fast shipping
The content is excellent the size of the book was disappointing standard paper book
as described
Arrived in excellent condition
Very artistic and warlike.
Classic
It may not be the longest written book but it definitely it the most powerful for its size
 True insight and understanding of how to tackle and conquer any obstacle.
orderd books for girlfriends little sister recived them in a timely manner..
 good job on getting them to her in time for school
can easily be used in ones everyday life if one can understand that it is not limited only to war.
good advice for lifes battles in the work place
Its interesting that his stratagem holds true in the st century.
The book os a classic the strategies are excellent and reading was fast
I would recommend it for coaches and salespeople.
Excelent version of the classic Sun Tzus Art of War with very good comentaries from contemporany and poscontemporany chineses generals.
Great book Great Price
Happy with the book and how fast got it.
Its a good book
Great read
Overall it was a good read but was a bit confusing with all the translations
The format could have been better but its worth reading at least once in your life
I now see why this has been the best war philosophical situations 
Seems everybody gives this one as a free one but few people read it
 It really IS worth the time if even the only thing learned is that the art of deception used  by Islamics is nothing new.
Great
Easy read
Informative and insightful information.
Its a marvelous book
Although I thought it be a lot smaller than it is
its clean with no creases in the cover or anywhere else
Good SUPER fast shipping.
i wanted to have this book to go with my other books
but this book was rather wide
but other than that is it exactly what i expected
not missrepresented in any way
i recommend all people ready this work.
Good to read.
Very happy with this book.
good book
Excellent
Great food for thought
Always a good read.
It was a really good book at a great price
My daughter ordered it
She liked it very very much.
helped me understand the book better
GOOD STUFFF
Didnt explain very well what it was it wasnt whats I was looking for.
Rather skinny book.
son loves it
Purchased for my son upon recommendation of our company CEO
He is an Actuary and loved it.
Still reading it its kinda deep still learning the art of war
Great book.
The books is very well known and it serves as a manifesto for those who want to master The art of war
This book teaches you not about war but you can use it in just about every situation
Great book

Basic and Brilliant
About  pages
Small and thin
Took me less than  minutes to fully read
Has different strategies laying plans maneuvering attack...Contains everything one could need to know about the Art of War
Though I ended up finding the whole thing online but if you want the book then here it is cheap.
Short and simple but lacks the examples found in certain other editions
Also the text seems to be missing certain vital points
Id recommend this to any martial artist strategist or military enthusiast
The translation notes really help understand everything that the author tried to get across.
Very informative.
Awesome read..
a must for anyone in leadership position.
Very clear way to analyse the situation with focus on your assets possibilities for sucess and failure
Its useful to read.
Has great business and organizational leadership value.
The ending of this book clarifies to not always as a leader let your follows know the entire plan is finished until it takes place  The killing of spies is not an easy part of this book to swallow  Christ did say He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword
Another one of the greatest books of all time
my daughter needed this book for an assignment and it was very easy to purchase
 Thank you very very much
The contents are fine but the book is a cheap reprint
Its also very small with few pages.
Its a good book to be familiar with the concepts but its a pretty boring read
 Like has been said about this book the ideas can be used in every part of life in general.
A classic thats still relevant.
This book is NOT the Art of War just a basic OUTLINE reviewing key concepts and principles
I do not recommended this product to anyone.
i received it on time and in very good condition
 it was a gift and he said he enjoyed it.
It is a classic so how can you not find this book fascinating  I am glad to have this one on my Kindle.
Book in excellent condition
This is what I expect from a seller..
perfect in every way..
buy from them with confidence
A is what I say
This book was easy to read with the notations and references
It is also practical for everyday use in getting ahead in your career  especially in corporate America
Just use your imagination
Interesting didnt realize it was dvd.
Very interesting read
I didnt realize the book was just a bunch of quotes most of which you can find online for free
Some relevant information you can use when negotiating.
Its interesting
Great book
No where does it say abridged or condensed
This is not the real book.
IT IS One of the best books I Have ever read it gives many applications for aspects it is A must read
This book is a good read.
Many of the points mentioned are applicable even today
Had read it before
Good but as a pocket version it didnt have translation notes.
Good read
A must for anyone owning a business
You will have be outside the box and way out in to the limits of normal thought but it makes sense.
Did not like the assorted commentary and a little obtuse translation.
classic advise everyone should read.
I had thought that this book would have had a bit more detail but it seems to be a highly abbreviated outline of the original Art of War
 Still it was a pretty good read.
The only problem I had with it was it was too short
I had thought that it would have been much longer and not end quite so abruptly.
Obviously a classic The Art of War is a solid meditation not only on the nature of war but the nature of life.
This wasnt at all what I expected.
Not the book we expected there are so many versions per the reviews I bought this one but it lacks in what we were looking for
Very thin compared to ones we have seen so I must have misread the description
Still lots of wonderful info.
Riddled with typos and apparently not the real book.
This is NOT Art of War but rather the bad version of its cliff notes
Amazon should not promote this as Sun Tzus book
No efforts was made towards basic editing or printing this book
Its cheap paper with really bad ink
The brown Amazon box it arrived in is far superior than this book.
What a great strategic
Its amazing
Not really a good book
Not one you would want to read again
Easy to read but not worth the time it takes to read it.
Apply to real business world marketing practices and can be taken as the book on effective leadership
Old but effective theory.
excellent
Good principles but not an easy read for western culture folks
Still worthile though you may have a different impression than me.
not the actual book
I am quite unimpressed and was very much looking forward to reading the book in its entirety.
Nice
I have had this book numerous times and keep reading it until I need a replacement
The strategies in this book can be applied to most any situation in business and has been read by every American President except the current one
And it shows.
great book.
Translator seems to be writing his own book about the famous book
 Very hard to follow as it is became a very boring history book about a book.
Very interesting and helpful book
But you need to read between the lines 
Basic text for understanding a classic
Many typos and formatting problems
 The only good thing to say about this translation is that it can put you to sleep  instantly.
A clear and understandable textbook of military science.
Have not started to read it yet
Im trying to finish  laws of power first
I cant wait to start it tho.
Great book
This book was wrote both in book format and to be used as a reference
Any fan of the history of war will enjoy this book on war strategy.
The book itself is a masterpeice
What I rate with one star is the fact that with this issue there is no foreword
It just says Filiquarian Publishing LLC from what you cannot find out who translated the book Is it Sam Griffiths translation Or whose It doesnt even say basic stuff about Sun Tzu
Nothing
If you ask me find a free pdf on the net and print it yourself just  pages because sadly there is no value for money in this print.
Sun Tzu is taught world wide for a reason  The man may not have came up with these all by himself but he understood them
 A winner  Sun Tzu not Hollywood is the great teacher about human conflict.
Good read.
A very awesome book  Completely satisfying  Im glad I had the pleasure of purchasing it
 I thank you very much
great insights when seen from the era this was written
true warfare wisdom for those times many of which are still applicable.
Straight from Sun Tzu without anyone telling you what he said
The book is short and it is up to use the knowlege.
i havent read this yet but the cover looks really cool
i have it on my desk so robbers think im really smart and will kill them if they steal from me
Super super SUPER condensed
Do not buy this book if you like to read
This is a short summary of each chapter
Im pissed I bought this
It has a total of  pages.
Simple and basic Sun Tzu with no fluff.
This is not a work of fiction or a novel
Its more a technical manual on the various components of war.
In every single paragraph there is distilled wisdom and many stories and dead bodies behind it
No word is used meaninglessly.
Missing Chapter 
It helps with other aspects of your life
This book is useful and I recommend it to all manager to read.
The alternative translations and historical background makes this my favorite interpretation
I bought the book for a friend
Therefore I am unable to review the content.
The philosophies of Sun Tzu are easily transferable to present time in the corporate world and in everyday business
 I am grateful that my professor suggested that I read this book.
Great Read
Un grand livre
Of course this is a  star read
It is a classic
It is the quintessential book on how to win a war
It has survived for centuriesd and has been studied many many times 
Its an easy read and very intriguing
Highly recommended.
Didnt know it was going to be that thin 
Nevertheless a fantastic book that came in great condition that all soldiers should have a copy of.
Good book
Quality of book was good for the price
Was delivered promptly
Useful in so many aspects of life
One can convert the principles in this book to be objective in any social condition.
I have heard about this book for years and I am glad to now have a copy
 It is a simple translation but a clear one making understanding this thinking...
It got delivered as promised and in great condition
Book is very small and shortnot what I expected.
The best daily version of The Art of War that I have.
Giving it a  start because I havent finished reading it but so far so good
Too many things to read and I have a LOT of these types of booksEbooks that I received for free and all at once.
Centuries in wisdom in one single book
Great book superfast shipping
what more can be said download it read it if you dont like it erase it got to love free things
This is more of a review of the book than the actual book
Very hard to read on a kindle due to all the names and annotations.
Good read
 Can be studied several times.
This is the basic text of the ancient text the art of war with very few illustrations
 I was expecting several illustrations.
Great quick read
Very short and choppy
The book itself is structured more like the bible than an actual book.still kind of interesting
This is an thoughtful and enlightening book which the strategies can be transferred to be used on our everyday lives.
Overall quality is OK great for the price..
which is free
Reads good nothing fancy
I do find it funny when I put the text to speech on listening to the voice try and pronounce all these chinese names Sun Tzu  Sun Ta Zoo I guess an audiophile may not like that but as for me I buy books to READ them
I probably would not pay for this version but for free it cannot be beat and Ill stick with this version.
Not a book 
This is highlights from a translation 
Maybe twenty pages .
Every marketing dweeb is in love with this book  We should not be at war for no reason but its a way to justify how to screw over the common man.
The book is so good
Awesome strategies to use in everyday life
Wish I could have read this a long time ago
Cant wait to finish
What can you say  excellent book at an excellent price
 I purchased five copies this time around for people I knew so they could read through the wisdom of this ancient leader and apply it to their every day life.
Uploading it to Kindle mustve messed up the formatting I guess The whole book is a jumbled mess of hanging paragraphs   and stray indents that ruin the flow of the words
 star from this casual English student.
It was great.
Great book
Typical paperback quality
The content of the book is great
Quick read with practical daily application
Its required reading at my school.
its ok
It is incredible such a famous book and its only commonplaces
I dont know many bussinesmen and politics what do they see in it.
Great book a must read trust me there is a reason  years after it was wrote it is still relevant.not as long as u would think.
Thanks so much
good read
It is what it is
I guess i was expecting more but for the time frame the man was brilliant
 I guess I was looking for more of an explanation of war in a more modern view
 My rating reflects a more personal view this may be just what someone else is looking for
For me its like looking back at the bow and arrow weve come a long way since then.
Bought it for a friend as a bday gift
 I was proud to give it as a gift
 High quality.
This book is a life changer
This is such a great edition
The commentary is fabulous
 I have listened countless times and it never gets old
Very simple design and a good translation.
Just what I wanted.
As with any ancient text translation matters greatly
Fortunately this version isnt fraught with errors and mistranslations at times common in free ebooks
The content needs no praise or introduction as it remains an influential and widely applicable text
A recommended read.
Great item.
True teachings to be studied and meditated on
Great book
Perfect condition
Excellent version of The Art of War
Not much extra derails or commentary but very good translation of the works.
i found this book to be very informational and i have truely gained much knowledge of what leadership loyalty and sacrifice is about...
This book has so many strategies for life work and home
 Im applying them all to every aspect of my life.
Beautiful
good
Good read
A gift.

Came in on time and how it was described.
Great read
Terrible cheaply made
Full of mispellings.
The best book out there
 Read it and live it your life will take a better turn
Thats no lie.
My son loved it
He read it all the night he got it
And for my son that was amazing.
It was a great read 
Loved it classic read.
i have not read the book yet  heard many good things about it  i will update when i am done reading.

Art of war no

Excellent translation and editing done well written
 A timeless treatise as has ever been.
Guide to life

I am only giving this  stars because I found it a little dull
I am sure that way back when it was written it was more interesting but for me this was a hard book to finish
Yay
Interesting book
Thanks.
A book that can be used in most situations of life.
Awesome  on time delivery great book.

My recent purchase of the Art of War was Utopian Success
The product was perfect
I am going to order  more
Thank you very much Amazon Paul Kuzinski  A very satisfied customer.
Best self help book ever
difficult reading due to ancient text and translation but that doesnt hide all the strategic and tactical thinking that populates tis classic work.
Was expecting whole book.
Great book
ordered this for my kindle its great i love it and my kindle not much more to say but that.
The reviews are clearly not all for the same book version
No explanations no forward just very brief and cryptic translation that was meaningless to me
Glad it was relatively cheap.
poor translation
This is a short formed book and not the full original
 Wanted the full version and spent money on this one just to have it sit on my shelf.
Classic
Good information bUT boring read
Good read
Very happy with the service.
still the military primer
great
I have wanted to read this for a long time now only bc Ive heard so much about how you can apply its theories to every day life
 Well I suppose you can
Sorta
 But after a while it gets exhausting hearing about how you need to wake up earlier than your enemy know more than youre enemy be more rested than your enemy blah blah blah
 Long story short study hard
 Work hard
 Im glad I have quenched my curiosity but Im glad I got it on the kindle and that its NOT taking up room on my bookshelf
 It aint that special.
Boring it reads like a book for geeks it reminds one of the old instrucktional books for the vcr
The opening of the book is a sleeper
I heard so many good things about it and then was greatly disapointed
This is for file thirteen a real snoozer
If you have trouble getting to sleep read this.
Not what I expected
 I guess it was written more like poetry not my cup of tea even though it offered advice on how to strategical fight a war.
great book
Fantastic insights on war.
Ive always wanted to read this book and when I saw it for free I just had to go for it
Its not the smoothest read but the principles throughout this book can be used in battle sports or business
Download it and see if you cant apply some of whats in here to your own life.
Dear Customer Service Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy  the teachings of one of the Chinese Great Thinkers and enjoy their rich history.
Great
i found it a rich book which can take these basics  use them in the real worlg of today
DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE SO SLIM I WAS EXPECTING THE THICK BOOK
 MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE READ DESCRIPTION

Very happy
good
its was great
The book is good
However I expected a bigger book what I received is like an abridged version
One of the best books to read.
It is a book that you have to read over and over again to understand its content and relate the strategies to real world action
Too much information packed in a tiny book bad combination
One thing I learned from this book always read the reviews first
This is an analysis not the Art of War.
Love this book...Tq
Good translation
Brilliant
This review is for the Filiquarian Publishing paperback version of the book
See the picture for the table of contents
I first thought the Roman numerals were misprinted and corrected the numbers with a pencil but I later looked the book up online attached a screenshot and the chapters are printed out of order Somehow the chapter roman numerals are sorted alphabetically.
War will come this 
Black people must prepare we need to defend ourselves against our enemies who plan to destroy us.
Loved it
Very boring and short good information.
My husband loved it
The translation given to me had a ton of grammatical errors the paragraphs were clustered together and the translation seemed off.
Its legible.
k
Read slowly.
What can I say about this book that hasnt already been said except that it lived up to my expectation.
good classic book
Bit thin
I think the chinese version is better
Translation is a bit ackward in English
A must
Not what I expected
It literally talks about war
I heard it was a philosophical book
Fast shipping
Good condition.
A must read for any leader or one who wants tone in a leadership role in the future...
It needs  stars it is not the art of war book
Bought this for my brother and he said it was very interesting.
Superb thrilling amazing wisdom and utility
Trump must have read this and is using it
We had best learn it too.
Great book period  Learn how past leaders as well as current use Sun Tzu tatics to fight Wars.
Nicely done
A little dry read
 Good principles for thought today..
This is not the full book that everyone thinks they are buying.
Good book
I was excited to read the art of war
When i started reading it i was very dissappionted
I think it is a very confusing read
Tthe translator is all over the place and then includes his own thoughts
Me and everyone else needs to find a better.copy.
Okay so I got this for a school project because it was the cheapest on the website under the impression it was a full  page book
If you are looking for the full length book DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
This book is no more than  pages long
If you are just using it for a reference book or something then its okay I guess.
Great read didnt get first x I read but when actually get into to it it makes sense and is awesome must read
Either this paper pack or that hard copy which like a bible has all kinda books written inside and hard copy well over  pages easily huge wanna good read get that one like  worth then read paper back explains the art and paper breaks it down like dummies for the art of war Im disabled long and short term memory y had read
So much
But I retained it finally well most part
But if not into all that reading which Ive had over a ur and not even half way done get paper back it maybe or so pages
Easy read
Took me an  to read and I dont really read so easy to read over and over so I can remember it
Something everyone needs to read regardless of life job or religion.
If you think reality is just a series of bizarre coincidences dont bother with this.
Not what i thought it would be
I suspect it has modern applications if you are a protester or as a political tool
Perhaps this is why it has become so popular.
the ways of this have been around for a long time now we have the art of texing and tis a great book for centering the soul in battle i have used it many times in life
Never received this and now its delisted
Excellent Timeless advice from a tactical master is easily translated into the realm of corporate strategy
A must have for everyone who wants to climb the corporate ladder
excellent price prodict and service
Read this and see where Prez Trump got his knowledge to run the government.
Mainly a curiosity read
Now that Ive read it I wouldnt recommend it.
Thinking mans book.
I was expecting the actual book
This is basically the chapters written down
A real Man sheds blood before he sheds tears.
The Translators Preface started on page vii and ended at page lxv
 Which took about th of the book
 I wondered if the book proper itself would ever start
 Now that I finished the book I dont remember any the Preface
 Then the book part finally started which consisted of hundreds of little pieces of advice by Master Sun
 Sentence to paragraph length
 Each piece of advice was followed by a short explanation or repetition by another Master of what Master Sun had just stated
 When did this format end  When the book ended
 As Sun was allegedly the Master I eventually started just reading Suns comments which allowed me to get to the end much quicker
 At least now I can truthfully say that I did in fact finish reading the book
 I marked one sentence in the book to be added to my review but now I cant find it.
Completing my classics collection
Never received this
Bought as a gift
I also have a copy
Well worth reading
good read
Cliff notes version I guess
It is just a list of items.
Why have they talked to each other Take bided for why Hey date to move over Related was out of the hay
Although this is an acclaimed book popular apparently in business schools and elsewhere I found it utterly unreadable
Not for me.
okay
Received it Great product and sale Thank you
Not Recommended
Concise and clear
Going to war read it
good read
i love it
Classic
Great
Not what I thought it was going to be
Clearly the customer pictures are truly not of this book
Its like  pages.
I thought it was a poor translation
Its timeless and a must read
This version is full of misspellings and apparently is not even a complete translation
Buy a different version this one sucks.
Good
Just OK
This is a beautiful edition.
This was a Christmas gift for my son
 Was a last minute addition inexpensive and he seemed pleased with the gift.
classic
great
okay
Stale...old school.
Ok
No....
It was like a little workbook
Maybe  pages at most
I thought this was supposed to be some transcendent book
It was tiny AF
If you order the paperback version the cover looks completely different and is longer than ish pages like it says here
Seems good though.
Great read.
Great book
A classic
This version doesnt have the best editing IX chapter is between IV and V and some numerals are mixed.
Good Read
nothing wrong with video just i dont get the whole message because I need a modern translation and thats not this dvds fault.
Tried to read this book on two different devices and it would not load
Amazon needs to have some kind of QA process
I now have to figure out how to get my money back
Ugh
Great book
This is a real classic that all business people should read once in a while
I am happy to have chosen it and it was shipped extremely quickly to me so I go back to reading it sometimes when I need a thoughtful advice...
I must first admit I had bought into the hype over how The Art of War is the greatest strategic document ever produced
 I was expecting some fantastic insight and in reality the Art is like most brilliant strategies very simple and basic steps to follow
 The trick is to not overlook the basics and keeping the discipline to always follow them
The book itself was set up into a very long and rambling prologue then quotes from Sun Tzu followed by quotes from other Chinese leaders andor philosophers
 There is no discussion about the meaning or intent of Sun Tzu beyond the quotes from the supporting cast
 In short the book is written with quotes supported by other quotes without any context
 If you read books to get the full story and context behind a subject go elsewhere
 If you are content with sound bytes and  second clips this book is for you.
Good read
Cliff Notes version
I will keep the substitute books because they are useful and different
 Instead of sending me the books I ordered they sent me other books that interpret the Art of War version done by Tom Cleary
 I like these but this is NOT what I ordered
 I will not use this vendor again and will make a note of this
 I think these people did this to me before.
Buy a classic and an easy read to cross off your To Be Read list
I suppose someone with a particular interest in either war duh or self help would enjoy it substantially more.
Boring  anyone in the service  knows this stuff
 Basic
.
This book has time tested principles that can be applied to most leadership contexts.
clear and concise
easy to read and reread to get better understanding
its not the type I wanted...I did not want a snap back
I was under the impression it was same as the white one with RW logo.
Keep in mind this book is placed in the Public Domain
This version of the book is not the best quality you will get although it is very cheap.
Not what was advertised
It is simple a book of quotes not at all the complete book of stories as presented on the website.
got it for a friend that needed it
Not what I was expecting
 A bad order on my part.
This book was bought as a suggested read to give to a young adult now moving out into the world as a way to conduct themselves.
IM A Y ARMY MAN LIKE MY DAD AND ANCESTORSI WISH I HAD READ THIS MANY YEARS AGO.I GAVE IT TO MY DAD WHEN I READ IT.
Gave me a different book in the middle of the Book Wtf I only didnt mind because it was vegan recipes..
bunch of bs.
Havent finished it yet.
A classic and a perfect gift for any young person just accepted by one of our outstanding military academies
 Not a good book for lefties.
good book should get it free so ya       
  n xhxjjd jd
Yes
No was disappointed.
I like that this book does not include a lot of other translations but it ends up looking and feeling pretty cheap.
really disappointed waste of my money and this paper supposely book was fill with quotes printed papers stapled together wth
Absolute BS
Ratings had to have been fraudulently inflated
Read the one star reviews and learn what the more discerning crowd has to say
Its all true
Im disappointed Amazon allows this
I expected a lot better
I want my money back.
Highly applicable to business and other careers college and schooling and many more categories of life
Highly recommend to everyone.
Eh...
This was not the book I expected
It was a very very brief summary of the actual book.
Excellent read
The chapters are out of order
Its not just a mistake in the table of contents but in the actual book itself
I was really wondering if every copy of the book is like this or is it a mistake in only some copies
For work its an easy read
This was a present for my neices birthday  she absolutely loves it The seller shipped quickly and the product was in great shape as described Thank you
Pure genius Sun Tzu philosophy on war is nothing short of incredible
Phenomenally written and simplistic at the same time.
It was a photocopy with tiny letter type
I was so disappointed as I was planning to give this to my boss
This edition is aweful
Spend a couple of bucks more and get a decent edition
I cant describe how bad this is.
The book was written a long time ago so it is difficult to enjoy it from my point of view because it spoke of basic routines in fighting aspects of war
They are basic compared to how we wage war these days and they look primitive in nature.
I have just downloaded the kindle edition
The pagination is awful rendering the text to be almost unreadable
amazon need to up their game and not charge for this abysmal level of quality of reproduction.
Awesome
good price quick sshipping
more of a strategy guide than a book i found no use for it.
Just a Classic
Cliff Notes
Good
This book is crap
It is put together poorly in fact midway through the book there are a our twenty plus pages that are out of order and from some other book
Crap crap crap dont waste your money.
The concepts are good however its written in parables which makes for not very good reading
When I search for Art of War using Amazons search engine the first book on the results list should NOT be an extremely short cliffs notes version of the book
 When I purchased this I was under the impression it would be the full length book
 This is a case of false representation and I do not recommend this book to anyone
 I would rate this book and my overall experience with  stars if that was an option.
great
Very simple and structured
Powerful read.
I would of left a positive review if i were to have received my product considering i purchase it nearly  weeks ago.
Nice story thought me a lot already
this book is frequently listed as one one of the best business books on various lists
it is okay but it is not a great business book.
I love this product 
great advice
Good
Great read
It is horrid
It isnt the book on The Art of War it is a publication of the cliff notes.
Not Recommended
I have not had a chance to listen to it yet because my laptop died and my daughters will not play it  but I am looking forward to listening to it.
Watered down shell of a copy do not buy
Bought for my dad for Christmas
Not sure if hes read it yet.
really good for the price I loved it
looks cheap
quick and was what I ordered
this is not the art of war just notes
Do not be fooled
This book was free and even at free it was still a waste
Do not bother
If your looking for the art of war check out The Art of War by Thomas Cleary very good translation
If you looking for the best translation it is The Art Of Strategy by R.l
wing.
Charging for free information
Enjoyed the book
Waiting for me to open up.
Nice book famous quoted a lot
 Got it for a book club at work
 Arrived fast.
Seems there are at least a couple and maybe several different translations that are being sold using this review thread
Im sure some must be good since the reviews are overwhelmingly good but the one I got is terrible
The version with the black cover white text and two horizontal red bars above and below Sun Tzus name is the one to which I am referring
I have only read a few pages but they are riddled with typos
Pg
 actually page  While heading the profit of my council..
The word is heeding
Almost certainly an English as a second language translator who didnt run this by a decent editor
Yeah yeah I know they know English better than I know Chinese but Im not trying to sell my knowledge of Chinese.
Happy with item
This was a free dowload and I probably will never read it thanks for the bathroom material amazon it was great.
This did not mention that it was an abridged version very surprising.
Never ordered it never received it.
The translation is clumsy and needs improvement
 Copy editing is sloppy
 Numerous typos misspellings punctuation and format errors
 Serves as a cheap option but would not recommend it for anyone seeking a quality copy to add to their collection or library.
Needless to say Sunzis this book is a must have on your shelf whoever you are whatever job you are doing you are going to use the ancient art of war to deal with daily trivia or business critical things.
Bullshit bingo book
Youll find famous quotes all around it in every chapter
It is best to win without fighting
Management of many is the same as management of few
It is a matter of organization
A leader leads by example not by force
Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons
And they will follow you into the deepest valley
Speed is the essence of war
And many many others
Sound familiar Right
They are used by everybody taken out of the context
Especially by life  career  business coaches of all kinds
Midlevel managers Clevel executive wannabes
By that kind of people not by military professionals
I can hardly believe that somebody who has professional military education will learn anything from this book
Its nothing more but a common sense
Like do not fight when you can
Cmon We all know that already Hide your weaknesses and strength from the enemy
Of course Ill do Attack at the weakest point
Sure nobody wants to die in a suicide mission fighting outnumbering entrenched enemy
And so on
I can hardly believe that modern military commanders use Sun Tzus terrain battlegrounds and positions categorization
As well as any other typification from this book
You can now bomb an enemy or send a drone
Or a nuke
Or a SEAL squad
Infantry and cavalry lost some of its importance during the last  years passed
The war despite war never changes has changed a lot since then
Think about this the book was actually written by Sun Tzu for his master king of the state of Wu when Sun Tzu served Wu during the confrontation with the state of Chu
So the context of this book is China Zhou dynasty era state of Wu
And the role of this book is clear too to summarize the knowledge available at that time
So the book cannot be used by its direct purpose nowadays  to teach military personnel and it became popular in another roles to be a source of quotes for people who want to show others that they read smart books and to be used for inspiration mostly by whitecollars
By people who will never use  of this book on practice
Because you know you cannot camp in high places facing the sun gather in plunder and put men to death together with whom the secret was told and do other fun stuff from this book when youre just a clerk
Even a CEO cannot literally put a man to death today
And yes Sun Tzu is not always humane in this book
One can say that The Art of War is a philosophical book not a tactics  strategy guide
Probably
Thats why Im giving it two stars
There was some kind of mysterious zen in it but I didnt become enlightened a lot
The book again is nothing special but a common sense of yearold war practice.
I began by reading an annotated version of the Art of War and switched midway to the original text because although the notes you can find in the free version on Amazon it was a bit disruptive and I wanted to read the original text before digging deeper
That said this is a fascinating book to read simply because it makes so much sense for so many things
For people in business the metaphors are easily adaptable to a business model and no doubt this book has been read by many a high ranking official if only to gain understanding of what it takes to win
The same could go for coaches and even lawyers
Basically any scenario where there are two sides and both are seeking to be the victor can benefit from this
But there are some interesting ways where you can adapt what is said in this book
To mediate conflicts you can use many of the same steps and recommendations postulated within
The main thing that is sought from the Art of War is to win with as little bloodshed as possible
For many the word war is synonymous with bloodshed conflict and loss of life
For Sun Tzu avoiding all that is what makes the best general
If you can position things to the point where engaging in battle is folly and thus surrender is a better option then you can see where hes coming from
In addition theres another application I can recommend..
having this text be read by writers
Conflict is embedded in what we write and for us who write fantasy and science fiction battles on paper are common place
If you want to make a battle believable study the things talked about in this book in detail and humanize the decisions taken the actions carried out and the mistakes that are part of a believable scenario
A rich read that will no doubt yield knowledge in its original and annotated versions.
A very brief summary of most of the key phrases or quotes from the original classic
Add graphic artwork  entertaining introduction to the classic
 I recommend it
 Buy the hard copy not Kindle
It is not the original full edition of the classic
This Smartercomic is not intended to be the full text
I read the Art of War or Strategy in college and several times thereafter
I refer to it periodically
The critics miss the point of this edition  an introduction and entertainment
After reading this edition you will want to read the original
It is enjoyable to read easy to understand and the artwork gives the reader a different perspective and promotes the application in todays world.
A
Overview The ancient Chinese military general Sun Tzu lays out a blueprint for the effective waging of war
In his classic The Art of War the successful war campaign largely revolves around two key elements deception and surprise
Sun Tzu also describes the virtues that are required of effective military leaders and drawing from his many years of military experience he gives wide ranging and insightful advice on knowing oneself knowing ones enemy and how to keep the spirits of ones soldiers fixed on victory
Throughout his treatise his words are piercing direct at times witty and often paradoxical
He writes for example If your opponent is of choleric temper seek to irritate him
Pretend to be weak that he may grow arrogant I.
Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline simulated fear postulates courage simulated weakness postulates strength V.

Virtues Necessary for a Successful War Campaign The Commander is to be an exemplar of five virtues wisdom sincerity benevolence courage and strictness I.
Discipline among the Commanders and soldiers is the key to victory
One can even determine which side in a war will be victorious by asking  Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law  Which of the two generals has most ability  With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth  On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced  Which army is stronger  On which side are officers and men more highly trained  In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment I.

The Law of Deception The Law of Deception is summarized by Sun Tzu with these words All warfare is based on deception
Hence when able to attack we must seem unable when using our forces we must seem inactive when we are near we must make the enemy believe we are far away when far away we must make him believe we are near I.
Sun Tzu goes to great lengths in justifying this assertion and in giving examples of how to deceive and to detect deception from the enemy
He writes Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance
Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat IX
but Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot IX.
At first then exhibit the coyness of a maiden until the enemy gives you an opening afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you XI.

Law of Surprise Attack Surprise is also an important element in weakening the enemy
The military is to appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend march swiftly to places where you are not expected VI
and in raiding and plundering be like fire in immovability like a mountain VII.
Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night and when you move fall like a thunderbolt VII.

Effective Warfare The rest of the treatise focuses on how to wage war in an effective manner
War is to be waged by first knowing oneself and knowing ones enemy
Battle is never undertaken unless one is certain that he will win
Sun Tzu outlines the five principles of victory  He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight
 He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces
 He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks
 He will win who prepared himself waits to take the enemy unprepared
 He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign III.
A successful war campaign is waged efficiently with the Armed Forces knowing when and how to attack by expending as little effort as possible for supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting III.
Few resources are to be expended in an effective war campaign The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy neither are his supplywagons loaded more than twice II.
Sun Tzu also seems to hint at a metaphysical plane in which warfare is fought
He writes for example that the effective Commander wins his battles by making no mistakes
Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated IV
as though war is first fought on some metaphysical plane before the victory and defeated is reflected in the visible physical world
B
Critique Some of Sun Tzus counsel is outdated in the age of terrorism military insurgencies and digital and nuclear warfare
Some of it revolves around the size and numbers of the enemys forces and ones advantage relative to the enemy based on numbers
Similarly much of his advice is based on obsolete forms of land warfare that are rarely fought in the modern day
He writes for example Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted VI.
This advice will rarely if ever be relevant in an age where most warfare is fought in the air or from long range missiles with forces rarely clashing in land battles
The advent of nuclear weapons also changes the entire equation of relative forces and makes the numbers of infantrymen almost irrelevant
Similarly the introduction of insurgencies that blend into local populations have been able to render even large armies of well equipped soldiers ineffective and unsuccessful
Furthermore the advent of digital and cyberwarfare makes the numbers of enlisted and commissioned soldiers largely irrelevant to foreign attacks
Though the forms of warfare have changed over the ages many of Sun Tzus principles continue to apply
Whether fighting a land battle or an air battle the laws of deception and surprise attack are still relevant and highly effective
Furthermore Sun Tzu outlines lessons that are important not only for the battlefield but also for the general struggles of life
He writes You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended
You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked VI.
This is advice that should be heeded by businessmen political leaders and anyone else in a position that requires defending against an onslaught of attacks or competition.
Ignore the reviews that claim this isnt the full book
It is
The Art of War without introductions and other peoples commentary is actually no bigger than a pamphlet
If you are looking for a larger version there are a vast amounts to choose from and can range significantly in page count depending on how much additional comments and stories they want to include
If you just want what was written without all the filler this is it.
I began this book wondering how a centuriesold text could be applicable to twentieth century business negotiations
 I finished it wondering why modern business books are so irrelevant
 Rather than summarize here are some of the jewels   A leader leads by example not by force
  The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting
  Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemys resistance without fighting
  Victorious warriors win first and then go to war while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win
  There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare
  The greatest victory is that which requires no battle
  When you move fall like a thunderbolt
  Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons
And they will follow you into the deepest valley
  Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across
  When you surround an army leave an outlet free
Do not press a desperate foe too hard
Sun Tzu combines a startling humility with a stunning sense of responsibility
 He could not care less who gets the glories of victory
 He would prefer to be called a coward and win then a hero and lose
 Sun Tzus chief aim is not to fight yet he bears the weight of his peoples welfare on his shoulders
 To protect his people he discipline himself and his troops mind body and spirit until they cannot lose
In a world that prides itself on external victories Sun Tzus view of conquering the internal foe stands in stark opposition.
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is the timeless classic on the manners of warfare
The book itself is quite short but the wisdom contained in it means that it is quite a dense book to read anyway
While we may now read The Art of War and think that we know most of the things I imagine it was simply a monumental book back then
Even now some of the passages contain immense value and many principles still apply
The principles outlined in this book are not only applicable to ancient Chinese warfare but many can interpreted in the world today
While many of the principles regards itself on positioning and strategic decisions some other principles struck me as well
Principles such as To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself
and Thus though we have heard of stupid haste in war cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays are applicable to everyday life as well
This arguably makes it one of the rare books which transcend the domain in which it was once written in and shows us something that is fundamentally human and gives us the opportunity to improve ourselves.
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is an ancient Chinese military treatise
The book a classic within the science of military studies is only attributed to the high ranking general and was believed to have been complies during the last spring and autumn of the Warring States periodeither  BC or  BC
I first heard of The Art of War by Sun Tzu when I was in the military
I heard of the book in passing and read a bit more about it when I got home but never picked up a copy until several years later
The first thing which struck me was how short the book was but the more I read the more I realized the wisdom behind the book
The second third forth and more I read this book I stopped for contemplation about what Sun Tzus words mean to me how I implemented his advice both in the military and outside of it and the mistakes I made how can I learn from them and if I will repreat them again
But The Art of War is more than just about war
The book is about every struggle or confrontation whether external or internal
I can certainly see how the advice applies to ancient warfare but when analyzed the book can apply to politics business and more
Sun Tzu understood as any great leadermanager that the leaders set the tone and spends much of the book discussing those qualities
This is true in any organization the sergeants will treat the soldiers the way the platoon leader treats them who treat the sergeants the way the captains treat them etc
Middle management will treat their employees the way upper management treats them  so simple yet so profound
However the part that really struck home for me was when Sun Tzu speaks about knowing yourself and your enemy
  So it is said that if you know others and know yourself you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles if you do not know others but know yourself you win one and lose one if you do not know others and do not know yourself you will be imperiled in every single battle
Profound advice from a great general  one does not go into any competition without knowing the opponents
Athletes do not step onto the field without spending house analyzing every available movie showing their opponents at play and generals dissect enemy strategies to tiny details before forming their own.
I really enjoyed this narration
It was easy and pleasant to listen to and the voices didnt detract from the information I was trying to soak in
This would be a good book to have a hard copy of or to reread several times to master all the principles and ideas presented within it
The Art of War was written by Sun Tzu a Chinese general and war strategist  years b.c
It is a manual regarding war strategy and its main principles can be adapted for leadership management and even parenthood in day to day interaction with others
I think it is a fairly useful concise book everyone should be introduced to
Here are the main points I liked from this book 
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting

One may know how to conquer without being able to do it
 which leads into Sun Tzus emphasis on discipline order preparation and training
And the ability to know when to act and when to wait

My favorite quote Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can 
If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles
If you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle 
The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy so that he cannot fathom our real intent

We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors

To obtain complete obedience and discipline you must administer ruthless punishment for disobedience on a regular basis
Small sacrifices are necessary for achieving the greater good
Yes I cheated and copy and pasted these quotes off of google art of war quotes after listening to this audio version
 And if you dont have much time to spare even for listening than consider going through those quotes for a summary of the useful portions of the book.
A lot of people read The Art of War to gain insight into business competition interpersonal conflict etc
Personally I think it is most interesting as an actual treatise on warfare statecraft and tactics as originally intended
Comparing the tactics and outcome of various battles and wars past and present to Sun Tzus advice demonstrates that he generally knew what he was talking about and many most of his principles still hold true
This translation made a serious effort to preserve the ambiguities present in the original giving it a much more Eastern flavor than some older translations
I cant vouch for translation accuracy since I cant read the original but Cleary at least sounds a bit more authentic than Giles the classic English translation
The commentary sections sometimes gave insight into how Master Sun was understood by others over the next few centuries but sometimes it was just a tedious unimaginative rephrasing of the original
On your first reading of The Art of War skip the commentary it breaks up the flow of thought
Also dont bother with the  page intro unless you really want to hear the translator pontificate about Taoism for  pages while saying nothing that you cant pick up from the book itself If you are interested in diplomacy espionage military tactics etc
this is definitely a great read
Next time you watch a war movie or play a conquertheworld type game youll find yourself thinking in terms of The Art of War.
So it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself you will fight without danger in battles
If you only know yourself but not your opponent you may win or may lose
If you know neither yourself nor your enemy you will always endanger yourself
The Art of War is the most prestigious and influential book on strategy that has ever been written
Sun Tzu showed how organizations can thrive in times of conflict and chaos by mastering five things the way the weather the terrain the leadership and the discipline
Strategy is simply the art of making the right tradeoffs
Everything we do in life has a costbenefit
We must examine our choices and make the best one at each moment
Success is being the right person using the right tools in the right ways for the right cases at the right times for the right reasons
When I was  I wanted to enter West Point to become a general to lead and fight the greatest wars of my time
Yet I began to realize that the biggest battles of this era were not between nations and man but between health and disease
The world was crumbling with pollution disease hunger fear greed violence ignorance and apathy
And these enemies would not be won by wars between men but by revolutions within minds
These revolutions will not occur with the government the education or any social institutions
It will happen with businesses
This is the book that first connected me to my father
He told me that business is like modern day warfare
That always stuck with me.
This ancient classic of  chapters was written over  years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu

There is no instance of a country having benefited from a prolonged war

I rank it in my top ten books I have ever read
It is a must have for any home library

Sun Tzus The Art of War is a great book
This ancient classic was written over  years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu being a a timeless masterpiece of interaction of power and politics this book teaches many good lessons to anyone who will ever have to command a group of people in the workplace in school or on the battlefield
The Art of War is an ageless book that teaches human nature and how to deal with difficult situations in life and business
The lessons learned in this book can be allied to relationship friendship career and make you a more complete person in general
I I recommend this book to be read by all those who wants to succeed in anything they do It is not just about lessons in war but can be used and applied for everyday life
The Art of War is a must read.
Im a civilian businessman and fan of strategy games and movies
 Ive wanted to read this work for years but never got around to it
 When a friend gave me this the audiobook version I finally did read it
Thoughts about the content The work is surprisingly short powerful and rational
 The descriptions are poetic but to the point
 Some passages are brilliant and selfevidently true some are harder to follow but the entire work is engaging and worth readinglistening to
 One can see why it is required material for military strategists and why so many people have called it the most important reference work on the subject of war of all time
 One of the most striking aspects to me personally were the apparent logical contradictions
 Act honorably because the moral high ground is critically important to military success yet deception is the essence of warfare and you must deceive your opponent
 You must follow these rules strictly otherwise you will fail yet you must remain open to opportunity and adjust your tactics accordingly throwing out the rules
 This is not to say the lessons are false or difficult but that there are thoughtprovoking dilemmas to be explored
 I was especially fond of the discussion of the roles of morality economics and spies in warfare as well as several of the anecdotal side stories of ancient battles and strategems
Thoughts about the presentationexecution Apparently the most common and best English translation available translates not just Sun Tzus original words but also the work of an almostasancient commentator who interspersed clarifications and illustrative anecdotes throughout the main text
 Note that this complicates an audiobook a fundamentally linear form
 Textually you can see that there is a tangent without breaking your flow depending on how the text is formatted deciding if and when to read the tangent
 In this particular case some of the commentary is truly required in place it just wouldnt be understandable to a st century American listener without it and some would best be read outside the flow of the main work such as the stories of ancient battles that illustrate one of the bullet points being made
 I believe the producers made the best possible translation from text to audiobook and the readers chosen are top notch but moreso than other audiobooks this work would just fundamentally work better as text and for this reason I drop it to  stars.
This is a decent version of a classic text
Its well laid out with a table of contents making it easy to dip in and out
The ideas and strategies are individually explained in a couple of sentences prompting the reader to muse over the ideas and gain a deeper understanding of the concepts
Originally written over a thousand years ago the timeless wisdom contained in this gem by Sun Tzu has been utilised by many military and business menwomen for profitable advantage
This Kindle version of The Art of War contains reliable insights and strategies that you can put to practical use in your daily life in an easily digested readable format
Colin G Smith author of
There are many translations of this work which has long been in the public domain
This is the popular translation by Lionel Giles made even more popular by the introduction from the bestselling author of Japan epics James Clavell
It contains Giles commentary along with the translation
The annotations give historical examples of the strategies in action
Game theory is calculated strategy
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is probably the oldest and most important book on game theory ever written
It is the culmination of the development of the best warfare tactics prior to the th century BC
It is considered the foundation for all military plans and is still used to this day
It is most popular for its ability to win wars without fighting one
Its application has shaped the world as we know it
The Art of War can be understood as a breakdown of the chaos of warfare into components that can be analyzed and understood
The tactics are mostly about controlled organization recognizing environments and situations and the correct response to each one
Organization is subject to change in competition
The Art of War is essentially the strategy of responding to changing environments
Response is thus relative to evolving conditions
  Laying Plans The core message of this chapter is to calculate as much as possible before committing yourself
Important themes include discipline ethics environmental conditions and assessing the competition
Its about setting up the mission and evaluating the competition
  Waging War The important detail of this chapter is to win as quickly and as economically as possible
Prolonged struggle means wasting resources and undermining confidence
When winning use the spoils as rewards and capital
Its about making war pay
  Attack by Stratagem This chapter is about deployment of the previous two chapters
The central message is to know thyself and know thy enemy
This stage indicates problems such as sieges bad management and interior anarchy or legalgovernment interference
Advantages such as good management exploiting opportunities and attacking tactics are covered
Strength is about cohesiveness and is independent of size
  Tactical Dispositions This one stresses putting yourself in a position where you cannot be defeated and waiting for the opportunity to defeat the enemy
It is about recognizing the breaks and taking them as opposed to creating the breaks
  Energy This part focuses on the power of deception to lull the enemy into a false sense of security and the use of spies to learn the enemys moves
It also stresses the need to evolve in battle
Its about building up war capability
  Weak Points and Strong This chapter encapsulates all the previous five chapters into an advanced war strategy producing outcomes calculating and responding to events as they unfold
The strategies are developed here
It is about creating breaks
  Maneuvering This deals with managing units and the internal problems they face on top of how to respond during movement to various circumstances
It is a chapter based on types of situations and responses
  Variation of tactics This section expands on the evolution of tactics and strategies based on situations and responses but concentrates on what causes failure
  The Army on the March This is advanced maneuvering especially across long distances with different terrains and how to deal with encounters
It is about interpretation
  Terrain This describes the various terrains that an army can encounter and when and how to occupy them
It talks about distances potential dangers and obstructions
Positioning is important
  The Nine Situations This piece explains the condition of each terrain in terms of its tactical advantages and disadvantages and how to deal with both
It is a very intensive chapter because of the number of complex conditions dealt with
  The Attack by Fire Arson in war is probably the single most troubling weapon that an army could have inflicted on the enemy around  BC
This chapter is obviously based on the most advanced weapons of the time which have since been developed
It is about using the principle of creating disorder and chaos to win
  The Use of Spies Without spies dont war
War is won based on foreknowledge not by calculation but by direct information about the plans of the other side from spies
Spies are managed in this chapter
Even though the work is quite short about  pages or less with commentary it is complex enough to warrant several readings
It is the equivalent to learning how to play advanced chess a game which compliments this study
There is a lifetime of thought within the pages
Napoleon was said to have used it and lost when he didnt follow it
The Art of War has become one of the most important self help books of this century popularized in big business as many executives have had recourse to this material because it offers a sound winning strategy
Most readers come away believing that the books message finds it adaptable to many environments because it is all about adjusting to variations and so can be applied to anything and everything
The Art of War is not supposed to be an exciting read
It is a strategy book a step by step guide to how battles are won and why they are lost
It is more to be memorized as a set of responses including when not to respond than to be understood
The combinations of the responses are unlimited
There is enough on the plate without asking why
Understanding why would come later and the answers to these questions would come from a very sophisticated understanding of the theory
It is an endeavor that remains open to the reader if they can come to terms first with the information that is here
Even if the book is not followed up on by subsequent study it can still leave a long lasting impression with its tips on discipline and achieving goals
It is great value for the amount of information contained in such a short burst
It will get you thinking strategically and that is more or less its claim to fame.
The Art of War by SUN TZU is not fiction
 Its a Confucianist take on waging and winning wars and business
It is important to compare this Eastern view of warfare with the western view as defined in The Prince and many subsequent titles
The heart of Sun Tzus thought is All warfare is based on deception
Thus when able to attack we must seem unable
Hold out bait to entice the enemy
Feign disorder and crush him
If he is in superior strength evade him
If your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him
Pretend to be weak that he may grow arrogant
Any football play has all kinds of people running around trying to fake the opposing team to going where the ball isnt
Perhaps the best strategic use of the principles was Ronald Reagons Star Wars proposal
No one knew if it would work
But if it had there was no way the Soviet Union could possibly have countered it
They didnt have the computer systems and because of their closed society they didnt have the young kid genius programmers that weve developed in this country
Although there was an awful lot of complaining about Star Wars in the academic community in this country it ended the cold war without a shot being fired.
I read the book while going through a very nasty divorce
 It helped me better understand that all battles arent worth  fighting
 Despite a perceived loss sometimes its better to not engage than fight a losing battle or a costly war
 That said if a person is going to wage war it clearly states that a person must be very well prepared..
The Art of War is an excellent guide on managing conflict..
Its message that resonated most with me was pursue peace.
This is a rather short book but the ideas have stood the test of time in warfare ever since it was written by Sun Tzu in  B.C
 This book has also been the Bible used to teach the winning principles of war down through the ages.Little if any of the principles have changedand if you look at any of the wars or battles over the centuriesyou will see that the forces who won the warsstayed true to these principleswhile those who did not follow them were defeated
 Not only in warfarebut also in any form of contest from businesssportspoliticspersonal conflictsetc.the same principles can be applied and the same results will occur
 Of the plethora of books that have been written over the centuriesnone has been better at outlining the principles of success and it would be well worth anyones time to read and follow the advice and wisdom found in this classic treatise.
This is about war but it is more about getting things done
 If you could only read  books in your lifetime this book deserves to be on that list
 I learn something new every time I read this book
 It is really neat
 I know a former state representative who reads this every single day and gets something new every time
   and other such classics owe something to this book
 It is simple and profound.

Note this is a LARGE PRINT edition
The Art of War sun zi bing fa in pinyin with tone numbers as Amazon doesnt like Chinese text a book really more about recapturing peace than promoting war despite its title is still considered essential reading in the area of military studies
It is more than just ways to win its a treatise on humanity
There is not a single aspect of military positioning that Sun Tzu omits something the Lionel Giles this is a reprint of his  translation expresses wonderfully
There seems to be a frequent misconception that Tzus work is somehow an Eastern version of Machiavellis The Prince
This could not be farther from the truth
One passage epitomizes this again in pinyin gu yue zhi bi zhiji yibai zhan bu dai buzhi bi er zhiji yi sheng yi fu buzhi bi buzhi ji mei zhan bi dai
gu yue zhi bi zhiji baizhanbudai buzhi bi er zhiji yi sheng yi fu buzhi bi buzhi ji mei zhan bi dai
My Chinese isnt great but heres a basic translation one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not winning defeating the enemy without battling is the pinnacle of victory
Whether youre planning on going into the military need to replace your old beatenup copy want to learn more about the Eastern mind or just need a gift for an old veteran whose eyesight may be failing this book is an essential addition to any bookshelf.
This book came up in so many must read lists
From business   leadership to Bill Belichik talking about its value
I finally took the time to read this book and I was blown away at how much I took from it
A great read that is more applicable than you would imagine.
This highly regarded and ancient work has been translated by Thomas Cleary with more subtle thought than other wooden stiff translations
 In addition to Clearys introductory commentary there are commentaries from  Chinese sages philosophers military strategists that followed Sun Tzu
These commentaries were written over many years after Sun Tzu and often add depth and perception to the original short text
 A strength of Clearys perspective is the relationship of this classic piece of literature with Taoism
The secret of this book is that it is actually an antiwar book
 Throughout the book Master Sun urges caution patience calmness preparation thought reflection intelligence gathering and avoidance of rash impulse and anger
It is this quality of the work the Taoist philosophy that underlies the strategy which would make this book of great interest to the corporate world
Master Sun advises on how to prepare for conflict how to avoid it if at all possible but if engaged in an unavoidable conflict how to move forward with the greatest chance of victory
 Make no mistake Master Sun does not have a simplistic view of victory since he reminds us that territory defeated must then become territory held a vast task that requires different tactics
 Master Sun spends much of his book in regard to assessment
 Assessment of your own strengths and capacities assessment of the enemys strengths and capacities the use of a range of different types of spies and other methods of assessment are discussed
 Master Sun believes that the more fore knowledge the general has the better he can develop a winning strategy
 This leads to a second theme throughout the writing of Master Sun which is the need to develop a strategy for action before taking any action
 If anything the book warns against anger and rash action but rather the development of a strategy and the assessment of the opponents strategy
 Another strength is that Master Sun tells us that having more troops more forts more weapons etc
is no guarantee of success and that it is the cognitive aspects of warfare that can make the essential difference
It is difficult to compare this book to that of Machiavellis The Prince since Machiavellis book deals with armed conflict but also with political infighting and the brutal necessities of ruling and leadership
Because war is a dirty wasteful business Master Suns book could be considered a great antiwar book since he warns against anger and revenge and places the center of warfare in the human brain not in the heated emotions.
Is anyone buying this book cause of Technoblade  it won the potato wars.
A common sense approach to war
May it be with an army or interpersonal there is always a battle to be fought and won
Consider this a short and handy reference guide to outwit your opponent.
Obviously written about wartime tactics but I actually saw a number of parts that applied to leadership within my corporate work environment
I understand that the translations to English are sketchy at places but the fact that this edition had more footnotes and author commentary than actual content was quite annoying
I skimmed most of that and just read the introductionshistory and the translation itself
If I were a general in the armed forces Im sure I would spend more time analyzing this and appreciate it more..
But still good stuff.
Weve all heard of this book its actually worth reading
 Even though Sun Tzu if he existed at all was roughly a contemporary of Homer and Isaiah much of his advice seems pertinent today
 And of course the work is quite a window into Chinese culture and history
 The Kindle edition I read was initially published in  translated by and including commentary by Lionel Giles
 Perhaps the oddest advice by Sun Tzu was for the general to keep his plans hidden from his own forces as well as those of the enemy the most annoying characteristic noted by Giles is the typical Chinese approach of dividing a broad category e.g
types of terrain into a long list of subcategories that overlap but are not comprehensive.
This ancient book of military strategy has been followed by military men and businessmen for thousands of yearstwo notable ones being Generals MacArthur and Patton
This work is attributed to Sun Tzu a high ranking general in China about  years ago though several other strategists are also quoted
Master Sun believed that war was a necessary evil and must be avoided whenever possible
He felt like capturing an army or city intact was far better than destroying it
His book outlines  chapters of military strategy covering everything from morale use of spies to position and timing.
This book unfortunately seems to have been published before it was ready as other reviewers also note
The elementary error on the Table of Contents page with Chapter IX  appearing between Chapter IV  and Chapter V  suggests no professional proofreader or editor involved
 The other spelling grammatical and content errors that appear in the text suggest that the material is a largely unchanged Project Gutenberg text file ..
All in all the publisher should really release a second edition that fixes the myriad easy to find errors
 Particularly since this book is obviously selling well and the publisher ought therefore have the funds with which to do so
In the meantime a comparable edition at the same price but properly proofread and corrected is the Pax Librorum edition which is fully downloadablepreviewable via a PDF eBook at the publishers website
 Or just about any other one from more wellknown and established publishers.
I am a high school science teacher
After reading this volume of The Art of War twice over two years I realized that my teaching employs Sun Tzus techniques
First and foremost when you go to war both sides have already lost
I have looked at other volumes and Im sure they have their positives but for the average Jane or Joe who wants the essence of Sun Tzu this is the volume
I have given away dozens of copies to various students over the years that I buy used online
I also sell my honey and produce at a local farmers market
I tell my students that business is legalized warfare
Again Sun Tzu is there to give tips on product competition pricing and grower reputation
James Clavell was brilliant in this edition of a centuries popular text.
Badly formatted
Only a tiny fraction of the book is original source material the rest is verbose prologue and the editors own explanation of every single quote
We cant just relax and read the original the editor is there on every page trying too dissect and analyze every word.
I had heard a lot of praise about this historic book before cracking it open
 The principles came across as valuable as a social tool for me that I can implement as a father a businessman and a coach
 In terms of the value of the lessons taught within the Art of War my expectations were met precisely
I was pleasantly surprised when I realized how easy to read the book was
 The breaking into verses and chapters made it feel a lot like scripture which is to me an easy format to read
 Every copy of the Art of War I have seen has different commentary in the back in my instance the commentary had some valuable material but altogether was not worth my time reading
 If you want to get smarter read the Art of War
Crazy but true this book helped me during my divorce
I read it and realized how many of the tips about war can be used in everyday struggles
I liked his tip about boring a person so they lose interest in you
Also fake weakness when you are strong or be fake being strong when you are weak
It sounds wild but i divorced a narcissist and believe me some of it was useful
A good read for interest as well
It is a classic
Did not read the reviews which I normally do didnt know it was a pamphlet.
AP World History Book Review Put honestly I am a student using my parents account who needs to write this review for a history class but dont think that changes my opinion of the book
All in all I found reading this book or more accurately treatise a thoroughly enlightening experience
Not only did it provide a rare insight into life back then through the eyes of a general but it also manages an astounding feat which few other novels can accomplish It is still accurate and relevant over two thousand years later
I will say that if your aim is to learn about the time period there are better choices but it was not written as a historical record
The general style feels as if it is simply giving you advice and the fact that it is written in some sort of almostsecondpersonbutalsokindoffirstperson style means that it feels like youre having a conversation with Tzu
All things considered I would certainly recommend reading this yearold military and political treatise.
The last place one would think to get advice and strategies to handle an undesirable work situation
The timing could not be more perfect for I fear I am fighting my own warfare  one of the mind and often unwitty comments from an unmentioned coworker
The battlefield is in an office space instead of a faraway country.
They are just seemingly random pictures from ancient China and have no relation to anything in the text
 The text itself is well formated if you want to read all of the annotations and asides and I found most of them quite helpful in understanding the various interpretations of the text and the choices the translator made when bringing it to English
However if you just want the translation of the original text without interruption this may not be the version for you
It would have been best to have set the asides into an annotation section and provide links to them from within the text as I have seen done in other Kindle versions
If this is ever updated to do that or if the illustrations had more to do with the text instead of feeling tacked on for the sake of selling this as an illustrated version then I could happily change my rating to five stars.
The Art of War is a mustread book by anyone who love The Romance of Three Kingdoms popular chivalry story based on the history of rd century China
I think it is a wise idea to read this Chinese classic from Thomas Cleary Translation
Had I encountered this from Archaic worded Japanese version I might not get so immersed into it
Cleary translation is really understandable even to nonnative English speaker like me
Also it is great idea that the interpretation of notables including Cao Cao comes after the Master Suns text
Comparing interpretation is really a fun
What I am impressed most about this book is it says that if you can avoid the war better not to fight
And its idea of how to manage an army is really close to modern idea of organizing groups particularly business corporations
Verdict Nice gateway to Chinese classics Rating  out of  Recommended for wide variety of Chinese literature and classic books fans.
The original book written in Chinese is a great strategy book however the English translation in this version is so poor that it is obvious that the translator did not fully comprehend nor being able to convey the essense of these strategies
Keep in mind that Chinese language must be taken in its entire context not seperated into individual characters and then translated word for word
What the translator has done in this case is equivalent to for example when English speakers say Today it rained cats and dogs the translator automatically translated into Today it rained cats as in the sense of house pet and dogs as in the sense of house pet instead of translating into Today it rained heavily
Another version of translation published by Publisher Cloud Hands see Amazon amazon.comgpproduct  seem to do a much better job than this version
So dont waste your money on this version.
This is a welledited edition of Sun Tzu the only aspect that left something to be desired was the inclusion of illustrative anecdotes I would have preferred if they were left to the end of the chapter
I can understand why this book was a fad in the business world but object to claims that the tactics described in this book are easily applied to business
 This is a book about conflict specifically war and there is much wisdom lost if it is taken out of its context
 There is much excellent advice for analogous situations political persuasion and debate games of Go Shogi or Chess or even sporting events
When taken from the world of conflict to the business the realm of cooperation in the sense that competing businesses compete to cooperate the best with their customers The Art of War becomes yet another tome of Eastern sayings which sound pretty and can be applied to any situation only because they come to mean very little
Those who will be in a conflict situation or wish to prepare for one even if it is a simple game of Go should study this book
 Read the text and the anecdotes and come back later to read it again gaining fresh insight.
I boughtgifted this version for all my junior NCOs
 I would give it to them on a Friday and I would have them brief me on what they read and how it could relate to them and all the way up to how it can apply to militaries as a whole
 I must of bought at least  to  copies of this in the past
 It is concise andan easy read
 I also have  different versions of The Art of War through different interpretations
 This by far the best  It would be nice if Amazon put this in Kindle format I would buy it the day it comes out.
This book on War is much like the Prince  you can wage war for good or evil
The Prince is a how to book for evil Princes  and if you dont believe me read your history
One of the best books I read after this one was about the family that Machiavelli consulted for and wrote the Prince for and about the Borgias
Its an example of The Art of War Check it out Machiavellis Disciple The True Story of the Borgia Pope   You will be astounded
I purchased this book at my local Borders Bookstore and after reading the text was very happy to have spent the price it is worth
There were two people on this page who gave the book low ratings
After reading what they had to say I can tell you that they dont understand The Art of War or how to apply it to our life today
You see philosophy isnt just books written to give you an easy path through life
No Philosophy is meant to get the reader thinking and to take what was said and learned before and apply it to their life today
Sort of like what Bruce Lee said absorb what is useful
This means take what applies to your life or what you can use in your life and forget about the rest it doesnt matter to you
I would recommend this book for those who are interested in Chinese history military history and philosophy
No matter what you are interested in you wont go wrong by buying this book.
Im not sure if this is the actual version I wanted to read and with that said maybe didnt get the gist of the Art of War.
I was expecting it to be more In depth and deeper but Found it to be short and even though it is illustrated I am not so sure if this is the go all end all for The Art of War
Maybe since my little hardcover book is a Compressed and Abridged or shorter version of the translation I am not sure but either way I found it insightful but certainly not what I was expecting
The foreword to my version talks about Fidel and Mao who used the art of war among many othersI dont know why this evil is mentionedAll in All not what I expected.
I feel the preponderance of business books has built up the original too much in my mind
It just felt very dry
Very boring
No its not a novel meant to entertain but I expected some modicum of enjoyment out of it
Plus given the passage of time and the nature of war its not really that relevant anymore
So while others may rave about this I just...cant
Its not worth it and the hype really needs to die down already.
This edition is not an abridged version
This is the FULL COMPLETE  ORIGINAL text
Apparently another reviewer wasnt too familiar with this work as it isnt overly large but thats the way the complete version is
Go complain to Sun Tzu  This edition is exactly what I wanted
Its the complete text and nicely designed too
While The Art of War was originally intended as a book of military strategy it is today more frequently used as an invaluable guide for business strategy
Highly recommended
Each section is profound and applicable to almost any endeavor
The context and translation is illuminating to an otherwise inaccessible text.
Just buy Sun Tsu
 Still a good read and does quote Sun Tsu
But if on a budget this will give you good quality info.
Not the best version of the book
I got this particular edition of Sun Tzus Art of War at a strategy course for sales
I already had a copy of it at home but this edition is so nicely done that I gave my old copy away and kept this one
The introduction of James Clavell is a nice touch
It is amazing to me that this book is not read in high schools or colleges in favor of Machiavellis work The Prince or The Art of War
Sun Tzus writing is clear and to the point
Unlike the popular Book of Five Rings by Musashi this book is not metaphorical and poetic its downright practical
And its not hard to read unlike many classics
If you are doing business in China this is also a good book to know
I mentioned some of the classic strategies while giving a course in China and every member of the class had read it knew it well and gave me many examples from recent Chinese history where Sun Tzus strategies were employed
This book is close to their hearts and will give you insight if you are doing business in the East
Of course the most famous anecdote from this book is about gaining the obedience of troops the emperor wishing to interview Sun Tzu for the commission of general asked if Sun Tzus military principles could be applied to women
Sun Tzu replied yes the principles worked for women as well as men
Accordingly Sun Tzu was given the task of organizing the emperors many concubines into an army
Sun Tzu lined up the concubines and set the two favorites as officers at the head of the columns
He gave them a simple set of orders to march and drill eyes front right face about face
The drums sounded and instead of following the commands the girls simply giggled and blushed
He repeated the orders again saying that if the orders were not clear it is first the fault of the general
He repeated the commands and the girls simply stood and giggled again
 If words of command are not clear and distinct if orders are not thoroughly understood the general is to blame
But if his orders ARE clear and the soldiers nevertheless disobey then it is the fault of their officers
 Upon saying this he ordered the two concubines at the head of the troop favorites of the emperor to be beheaded
The emperor hurriedly sent down the command to stop he had no desire to see his favorites executed
The emperor said We are satisfied that the general knows how to command
But Sun Tzu said Once having received the commission there are certain commands I am unable to accept
And he ordered the two favorites to be beheaded
Once again he gave the commands
The concubines marched whirled about and drilled in perfect order
 The emperor appointed Sun Tzu general.
Few of the classics have that timeless quality that a reader finds enduring
The Art of War is one of those with its wisdom and lessons in how to predict what your enemies will do and commonsense advice on how to avert disaster
This book has long been a favorite of business executives and entrepreneurs and I highly recommend its wisdom to anyone in the present day who is trying to make their way in an uncertain and unpredictable world economy
This is an easy to read book suitable to people from any walk of life
Arm yourself with it and use it wisely

My history with the book is listening to is a tape deck version of Lionel Giles reading of Art of War
Product Review Product casing Case outside is paper with a sleeve inside containing the  CDs but has room to store up to  CDs
Product itself This new version gives readers spectacular ambience with the reading
 There are  voices within the reading
B.D Wong I believe is the younger sounding voice his reading adds a little bit of Asian highlights giving more life to the books reading
Ron Silver I believe is the older sounding low voice his reading adds a relaxing clear understanding of the language and tone of the book
Both readers do a very good job
The other two voices read commentaries quotes and questions
Stefan Rudnicki has a rugged voice deeper low voice
Shauna Zurbrugg is the only female voice and gives something different from the male voices
There sounds like a th voice at times but no other reader is mentioned
 There is subtle music in the beginningend of chapters it would seem to be an Asian decent lullaby
 There is no static whatsoever so its truly a digital mastered recording
 The chapters are separated so you can skip to which chapter you want to hear
If youre trying to decide between the many copies of this book Id suggest this one if the price is the same or very close as you will be happy and satisfied
If a price is substantially different go with the cheaper one as most readings are very similar for this book in the two readers I have come across.
I assume amazon is once again shadily mixing reviews because some of the other reviews clearly read a different book than me
The translation is all over the place in some places its fine yet in others grammar syntax and even the basic vocabulary is lost
If you want an idea of how much proofreading was done prior to release let me give you the chapter order
              Im not joking they didnt even manage to count to  right
I wish I had had a chance to read this before the return date passed this literary abortion would have gone straight back to the cheap illiterate womb from which it came...
The first time I read this book I found it amazing
Sun Tzu was an extraordinary master of the topic
Many world leaders of the past and the present have found inspiration throughtout these pages
This book has transformed the vision of many people even the common citizen
If you want to gain knowledge and manage art of living facing every day inner war The Art of War is yours
Difficult to read
 But very insightful
 The strategy of modern warfare
 Discussed by Asian warlord a thousand years a go.
Cant remove it from my queue
I read a translation of this book here in Brazil
Being writen in China more than  years ago this book is a proof that a great book doesnt gets older
The focus of this book is military tactics but it is usefull for everyone
United States of America won World War III or Cold War following the advice of this book The biggest military conquest is to win without fighting
And this book is full of great advices for any commander
You must know your enemy is one of these advices
Such as the Bible this Sun Tzus book is forever.
Simply put this book contains a great deal of useful wisdom
 This information is presented in short sentences and statements so do not expect lengthy dialogue and is most likely a cliff note version of the original but still worth a few dollars
 Some of it is obvious and commonsensical whereas other points may be obscure or not obvious to the reader
 Regardless for those who have interest in warfare and strategy it is worth reading.
A book about drug lords in North Dakota
This is a great book for learning  the tactics of war from the eyes of a general it can apply to daily life under the right circumstances and helps me get a grasp of war and its inner workings.
This book has much wisdom for today even though it was written so long ago
I was able to draw many parallels not only to the war situation of today but also to the business world as well
I will admit that there were times that I thought the book was communicating more than I was receiving
While it is a short book for the full impact to be felt it is one that needs to be taken slowly and in short bursts in my opinion
Since the wisdom has transcended time it truly is a classic.
An excellent way to come across as a learned individual without actually having to obtain a degree in literature The perfect vehicle to aid you in exploiting western societys fetishisation of people who can rattle off seeminglyprofound quotes or make obscure literary references
Are you a STEM PhD looking to match one of those Englishliterature majors in displaying a facade of cultured sensitivity This is the book for you
You can easily overlook the depth of this work as it is quite a short and simple read
However in terms of symbolism it can be related to many aspects of life and strategy applied past the battlefield
I think given the knowledge return on investment for such a quick read everyone should read it at least once
I plan to revisit it now and again to look for additional meaning.
I bought this book because its commonly recommended for managers
Its honestly the DUMBEST thing i have ever read
 Maybe if you consider management to be some kind of battle field this might make sense to you
 For me this line of thinking represents everything thats backwards and nonsensical in managerial thinking  so...
good luck with it.
Great principles
For some reason chapter  is put in between chapters  and 
 I researched this to see if this is common with other editions and it is not
 There is no information or explanation as to why this was done and it is noted in the table of contents which tells me it was done deliberately
 I am likely going to return this item and find a copy that has everything in the correct order.
A definite must have for anyone in any field or curriculum
Classic book about the mental and tactical aspects of battle
Great read
If I wanted cliff notes I would have googled
This is a piece of garbage.
This book is a must for history buffs and students of life
The  year old principles still apply today
The concepts touch on how to think like a leader and apply strategies for life and war
Sometimes the two are the same
This large print edition is a condensed primer that will enlighten you while helping improve your own strategic thought processes.
Lo que aparece en esa pelicula se puede aplicar a casi cualquier situacin de la vida.
what a classic piece  i ordered this through my kindle for  so the price was perfect  honestly i can not comment on the quality of the translation
 i assume that it is accurate
 i found that it was a fast read until i stopped and thought about what he was saying
 the authors comments often coincided with the places where i felt the need to stop and reflect
 this was superb and it is a book that i intend to reread
 while i prefer peace to war the content herein can be applied to even peaceful efforts
 i highly recommend this book for every cadet in the academies and junior officers
 everybody else with an interest in the strategies and tactics of competitive engagement also would benefit from reading this
 i give this a solid A.
A common sense guide to the embattled leader
 In this classic the reader will find advice on building alliances considering advantages and disadvantages maintaining morale maintaining discretion avoiding selfglory and adapting to everchanging circumstances
 All of these qualities are necessary in business and life.
Going in my expectations were high  The Art of War is praised as an alltime classic equally applicable today as when it was first written a philosophical insight into all manners of conflict including business and some have claimed even romance I did not find all of these things here
Instead I found a brief and simple outline of various battle tactics and tautologies usually on the level of the field general
This is not to say that this is worthless or that there is no way of taking the information and applying it  via analogy  to problems today
But I did not find it compellingly analogous to todays world or no more so than any number of older works
The Art of War is a short fast read
It is worth reading for its historical significance and for a few insights that are not strictly obvious and some of it may be applicable with some mental stretching to your quest to be promoted to the next level of management or romantic victory over a rival or whatever it is in your life that approximates war
If other people find profound lifealtering depth in its lists of the types of terrain or observations that its better to attack your foe when theyre tired rather than wellrested etc
then more power to them
I feel its possible however that some of this depth lies more in the creative extrapolations of the reader than in the work itself.
If youre looking to unlock the arcane secrets of modern warfare this is probably not the book for you
Much of the information in this book applies to ancient chinese warfare and general strategytactics as can be expected
Still a decent read.
Great and quick read
It is a bit of a rough translation but for the most part you get the message
Id heard a lot of this book and glad I finally gave it a read.
I checked out the free sample and its a copy of the free edition already available through project guttenberg and is free through Amazon So why would anyone pay even a dollar It says its an updated version but frankly I saw no updates in the sample I downloaded it was exactly the same as the free copy I already had...except for the jacket cover which with my kindle is utterly useless I wouldnt pay a dollar also on principle what work have they done to merit it I couldnt see any
If its there its not obvious in the sample
Avoid.
Cmon if you havent read this u need to push that rock out of your way.
I am going to talk about what is The Art Of War for people who has not read it yet
Other reviews on the same page says enough about the edition and publication
The Art Of War by Sun Tzu is a precious material to study for military theoriees decoding how people think and that certain period of acient Chinese history
I have read the original Chinese versionand been taught some of it in high school
To get the most out of your interactions with others this text will give you the tools to make things go your way
The text would teach you how to make a plan for anything in daily life and usually that plan would works if ur are basicly smarter than your opponents
You can consider yourself as a nation in the text which makes your move in your work become the army in the text
Also socially relationships would be like politics or diplomacy in the book
However In the acient wars between nations there is no ethic
But you are the key to make it useful in a good way
I suggest audience of Sun Tzu to do a little research on Sun Tzus private life
There were a lot of interesting events happened knowing which will be a great help on understanding The Art Of War further.
For centuries people have been referencing Sun Tzu to either contradict and justify or even glorify war
However I think his most influential work responds only to an era that no longer exists and an era that we shouldnt keep on reviving
We must embrace a new system of thought or more applicable political theory.
The Art of War has in recent decades been applied to such modern day problems as politics and business  really anything where conflict can surface
 It was also suggested reading during my entire time in business school
 So I finally pulled the trigger and read the original or at least the most wellregarded translation The Art of War
 The most impressive thing to me which is explained in the introductory material is how well the Chinese recorded their history
 My only complaint about the introductory materials was that most great Chinese historical figures have multiple names  this makes it hard to track who is who in some of the commentaries
 The actual strategies themselves are full of guidelines on determining your opponents weaknesses exploiting them and achieving victory
 Not exactly full of moral or ethical advice so I cant use much of it
 Im glad that I read it as it gave me a great look into Chinese history...but its practical use in my world is limited.
I love The Art of War specifically for making you read it SLOWLY..
You can breeze through it in  minutes but it was really meant to take a doseaday of it ponder on the connection to your personal life and do your own interpretation
This is also why I particularly liked this edition which doesnt include any notes historical contexts introductions etc
It really doesnt need any  the words speak for themselves if you just listen close enough..
And it makes the book small and carryable in my bag for the right moment when I can take a sip of wisdom.
Classic great read
In a time when competition is at its highest its even more important to go back to a time when the battle was for life or death
 If youre in SALES you need to adopt the teachings of The Art of War to win when you cant to win when you lose and to win more when you win
 The art of peacefully coexisting will help your clients win and with better results
 When your clients know that you are in it for them and willing to coexist with your competition who wins  Everyone
 Read the book or get the audio book and youll understand why
 Your clients will appreciate it and so will your bank account.
FALSE ADVERTISING  THIS IS AN ADDICTION SELF HELP BOOK WITH SOME CLIFF NOTES FROM THE REAL BOOK IN THE BACK DO NOT BUY
This is the old public domain translation of The Art of War
I had to return this book along with a few others which suffer from this problem
Luckily Amazon handled the exchange of the two books I had to return promptly
As to the The Art of War itself it is of course the most important work on military philosophy ever written at least thats what my husband told me to write
I am plowing through the other deluxe edition I received instead of this one with the errors but so far it is just as fascinating as the special about The Art of War I saw on the History Channel.
This ancient classic of  chapters was written over  years ago by the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu
It is a must have for military buffs that enjoy reading about the tactics of the most succesful generals
It is rumored that Napoleon used a French translation of the Art of War to his advantage while conquering most of Europe and he lost when he broke its principles
The principles that are with in this ancient text can also be used in games of strategy business conflicts and the day to day battles of life
Here are ten principles to give you a sample of the wisdom found in its pages Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance with out fighting
If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles
Spies are the most important element in war because upon them depends an armys ability to move
All warfare is based on deception
The general who wins a battle makes many calculations before the battle is fought
There is no instance of a country having benefited from a prolonged war
The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy and does not require too much from individuals
In war the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak
When you surround an army leave an outlet free
So they can retreat
Move not unless you see an advantage use not your troops unless there is something to be gained fight not unless the position is critical
Taken as a whole this is a book of wisdom and principles on how to win
I rank it in my top ten books I have ever read
It is a must have for any home library
The is a very small book that is quick and easy to read.
I have read several translations of The Art of War and Thomas Clearys version is by far the best
It is a book to be read and reread time and time again focused concerted and rich in understanding the nature and expression of resistance and conflict
Regardless of whether you are interested in deep confrontation battle or war this excellently edited edition will have something of interest for you
Published primarily for use in world philosophy and studied at military universities and academies around the world this book is very constructive in providing a well researched diversion sampling from one of the most important theorists in the field Sun Tzu  BC   BC
Although the philosophies contained in this text can be challenging at times in the end the perceptive is absolute
As the seriousness of our global problems persist and even worsen this book will continue to be a highly informative source of information for leaders and citizens for years to come
And for those who are looking for a more methodical approach to examining our relationship with the world as opposed to the more publicized takes this book will be especially valued.
Basic learning when it comes to tactfully maneuvering the business world personal life or any other relationship
Classic and a great read.
Good
Love it
This is propaganda
Hating on the Japanese and all how despicable.
Very inspirational
Allowed my wife and I to learn more about psychology and how often many play a victim versus the threat
Also goes into detail about being focus and it allowed us to have a better in site in other people behavioral patterns
Plus its just an awesome novel.
Two points in this book  Know your enemy and Only fight when you can win speak volumes to how the NVA fought the Vietnam war
They were very consistent in fighting on their terms and only when it was advantageous to them.
this is a amazing book hard strategies but easy to understand 
 Sun Tzu is a genius and was a great General.This free edition comes with everything included.a great read and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good book to read
Instead of being too late sacrifice whatever is not coming along right in the moment that presents an opportunity or everything might fall into the hands of the enemy
Monetary mushroom clouds work according to the strategies in this book.
Battle of the Sexes I could relate to this as a strategy for family and relationship disputes and business decisions remain faithful to the mission
This is an awesome book and a great gift idea
However I paid 
for mine on Amazon so anything more than that is crazy.
Great read
Hard to read but cant stop trying.
Sun Tzu begins his treatise by saying that The art of war is of vital importance to the State
A matter of life and death a road either to safety or to ruin
Sun Tzu says that the art of war is governed by five factors
These are  The Moral Law  this causes people to be in complete accord with their ruler so that they will follow him regardless of their lives
 Heaven  stands for the seasonal conditions
 Earth  stands for the physical terrain distances great and small open ground and narrow passes
 The Commander  the virtues of the military commander
 Method and discipline  the marshalling of the army and its divisions logistics expenditure Sun Tzu says that all warfare is based on deception
The objective of war is victory
Sun Tzu says that if the campaign is longdrawnout the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain
Sun Tzu says that there is no instance of a country benefiting from prolonged warfare
Sun Tzu says that there is no merit in fighting and conquering
Merit consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting
Sun Tzu quotes the proverb If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles
If you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat
Sun Tzu says that The fighters must first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat and then wait for an opportunity of defeating the enemy
To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by a mistake on the enemys part
Security against defeat implies defensive tactics and the ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive
Battles are won by committing no mistakes
Sun Tzu says that in war the strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won whereas the one destined to defeat first fights and looks for victory afterwards Sun Tzu says that in war the direct method may be used for commencing battle but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory
There are only two methods of attack  the direct and the indirect  but in combination these give rise to an endless series of strategies
Sun Tzu says that one can be sure of success if one only attacks places which are undefended weak points
On the other hand the safety of the defense can be ensured only if one holds positions that cannot be attacked strong points
Sun Tzu says that if one knows the place and the time of the coming battle one can marshal ones forces from afar
Sun Tzu advices the general not to repeat the tactics that have gained one victory again and again
The way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak  like water taking the line of least resistance
Sun Tzu says that maneuvering with a disciplined army is advantageous but with an undisciplined multitude most dangerous
An army without its supplytrain without provisions and without bases of supply is lost
Forming a single cohesive body it is impossible either for the brave to advance alone or for the cowardly to retreat alone
Sun Tzu says that it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to oppose him when he comes downhill
Sun Tzu says that the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemys not coming but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable
Sun Tzu says that five faults must be avoided Recklessness Cowardice A hasty temper A false sense of honor and Over concern for ones troops
Sun Tzu says that if fighting is sure to result in victory then the general must fight even though the ruler forbids it if fighting will not result in victory then the general must not fight even at the rulers commands
The general must advance without coveting fame and retreat without fearing disgrace
Sun Tzu says that rapidity is the essence of war
And that the army must be kept continually on the move
Sun Tzu says that a spirit of enterprise must be cultivated if one wants to succeed in the attack and win the battle
Otherwise war is just a waste of time and will lead to a stalemate
Sun Tzu warns that the general should be fully prepared for war  because a kingdom that has been destroyed can never again come into being and the dead can not be brought back to life
For those interested in the study of war and war strategy you cant do without this book...
Cheap edition of a classic text
The information is all there but its riddled with typos.
I bought this as a gift for my son who just took over as CEO for a multinational manufacturing operation
Hopefully this will be as helpful to him as The Prince was
As always packaging and delivery was flawless
Way to go Amazon
Ive read several interpretations and translations of The Art of War
Although this is not the most famous presentation it is quite informative and is by far the most enjoyable.
This book is red by almost every officer during his or her life
It contains so much valuable info about war strategy and life in general.
This is a good read with many proverbs and sayings that are still applicable to modern times
 Sun Tzu is vague and it for that very reason that this book is everlasting
Also recommended The  strategies The book of five rings Go Rin No Sho and the Hagakure.
Wasnt what I expected but informational and to the point
Makes me want to fight lol
Love this book
It can be used in all fields of work.
Great book
Very good book
No pictures whatsoever
Having read about a half dozen versions of The Art of War..
most with extensive footnotes and difficult translations I found that this version which was supplied to us at Motorola on a training session was my clearest and practical read.
Good explanations as well
Granted most readers will find some wisdom in The Art of War on the other hand perhaps most of this wisdom is simply common sense dressed up in militaristic metaphors
I know that some of the popularity behind this book stems from the fact that plenty of its readers usually male are hiphop figures business types and budding entrepreneurs
Im sure the occasional gang leader took some leadership cues from Sun Tzu was there really a Sun Tzu and this probably created an almost cultlike devotion to an ok book
I believe its not quite one of the best leadership books ever as some might suggest
Read it to relieve your curiosity then delve into more modern tomes by folks such as Seth Godin or Guy Kawasaki if youre looking to start a business in todays world
In addition youll gain still more by reading biographies by one of todays business leaders.
Its a classic that you can read in under an hour
One of the best books I have read
Simple basic and a great strategy foundation
I refer to it all the time
Great book from a historical standpoint but certainly is a great asset in business.
As a business major The Art of War is an excellent tool when it comes to strategizing
However this book goes beyond the professional
On a personal level Sun Tzus writings can apply to all aspects of life and it certainly has helped me
I can only imagine how effective this book is for the military...
This book is amazing something everyone should read
For philosophy and life this book is a must read.
This is well known as the classic text on the subject of both war and business
 Theres much wisdom here and you dont have to be a corporate psychopath to appreciate it
 Tony Morphett
I was expecting this book to be more interesting than it was
 I had just read The Prince by Machiavelli and really enjoyed it but The Art of War was just less interesting in my opinion
 The most memorable part is early on when Sunzi demonstrates his leadership by training the kings concubines to obey the orders of a general
 That story is definitely worth a look.
I was expecting more from this book
Doesnt look like a lot of work went into making this.
I love this book
It basically tells you how to win at war and it is fun just to read but it is especially good if you want to win at something
It doesnt have to be war
Anything that requires strategy
It has much wisdom
I do have complaints though
In this print of it there are far too many notes
one fellow said that this was the footnotes
That is not true
There is a ton of notes put in at the beginning though many pages so I can see how someone could make that mistake
It is a great book over all but it doesnt need nearly as many notes as it has.
The translator decided to spend most of his time creating his own content and offering a self serving history lesson rather than just letting the text work as it has for centuries.
There are translations about other masters and theologists about what the words Master Sun was saying not just Master Suns words alone
This is not just a guide to waging warfare but to corperate life everyday life and every aspect fo day to day living
This is deep Taoist philosophy so prepare to be enlightened A true timeless classic.
This is a great book
The advice is timeless and not always what youd first expect
It has stood well through time and most translations.
Mandatory military read
All those who have served will serve and are serving regardless of rank should add this to your professional materials and read.
The book is really presented in a beautiful format
Nice Book For Library But The reading can change your tactic about life in General A Must Read  Over  Over  Over Rodney McAllenTexas
Everyone should read this book at some point in their lives
 Even just one page if thats all you have time for.
If you know anything about the Art of War its from quotations taken out of context that seem to say something and seem to be profound
 The idea is that actual war is a metaphor for the conflicts that one encounters in life and that the advice and tactics are just as applicable
Not really
This is a book about medieval Chinese warfare and by and large most of it is about precisely that maybe ninety five percent
 If you want to find out how to get good at business read a business book
 And if you want to get good at life maybe get a selfhelp book
 If you are mostly interested in the history of the era this is it.
Great book.
ON A  FORD MUSTANG YOU MUST REMOVE CLEAR LENSE AND SHOVE INTO SOCKET
LIGHTS STAYED ON DIMMLY AT FIRST BUT MY CAR FIXES HERSELF.
Interesting Read.
Good price.
can be applied to real life situations
Some translation issues in this I think but you still get a good sense of the book
I have read it in  other versions and this is not my favorite.
This is just that stategies for war
I liked it because it gave me different look at any kind of conflict and what I need to consider prior to everyday conflicts.
Concise and accessible version of such the famous and prestigious jewel of Oriental and military literature
Certainly Two thumbs up
you can learn not only stuff about war but can also apply this to daily life
using these techniques you can be anything you set out to be
i highly recommend this book.
Seriously They list this for sale Shameful
 Accidentally clicked on it
Accidental purchase
 Awaiting refund
Why would anyone buy this book when it is freely available in public domain with free quality downloads everywhere  Title The Art of War by Sun Tzu Best translation by Lionel Giles 
Free at both Gutenberg dot org and archive dot org
Listed under the heading Sunzi bing fa
English
The seller was great Shipped very fast
Just wasnt expecting it to be such a short book Again everything was great unfortunately the book itself was kind of a let down.
My second book
This book keeps appearing on my device but not on my amazon website account
Anyway it seems this book would be better titled the art of mastering your ego cultivate the wisdom your aggressor cannot
I enjoyed reading the philosophy about how to be an effective leader and the mindset to succeed in battle and in life.
Classic wisdom for war and life.
Wonderful book.
I aspire to cook like her one day
BEAUTIFUL BOOK
INSPIRING.
Excellent would purchase it again.
The Art of War is a book that you can take certain principles from and apply them to everyday life involving adapting and strategizing toward those who you consider an enemy
Its also a book that involves tactic about warfare itself but it based on the readers perception of how they choose to use it.
bought as a present for someone
this paperback description says it was written  years ago but if you click on the hardback version its  years ago.
Great book
good reading
This book gives you the basics in a very supplier And logical way to grasp
Great book
A must read
For everyone
There are principles that everyone can use.
Everyone should read this of course
Fast fast delivery thx
A must have classic.
Outstanding read
I didnt order this.
I was disappointed when I started reading this book and onlyd turned two pages when the book ended
I was angry
I hadnt wasted any money because it was free but Id wasted time
This book doesnt even really have one sentence and I cant see why some other reviewers said this raggedy book was informative and understandable
Dont buy this book.
Those who love this book should now read The Art of Non War  by Kim Michaels
The art of war was written from an UNBALANCED state of consciousness  the state of consciousness which states that we are separate beings separated from our planet and each other
Nothing can be further from the TRUTH
Without me having to go into any lengthy explanation the books Infinite Mind by Valarie Hunt and The Biology of Belief by Bruce H
Lipton  PhD including Dr
Liptons YouTube presentation should be read...in addition to viewing the YouTube video Earth Seen From Space Keep in mind Einsteins equation which states that EVERYTHING is energy therefore our life experience and the life of the planet its self is based upon the interaction of the various energy systems
Sand storms in the Sahara desert find its way into the Amazon jungle AND northeastern states in the US  along with all the pollutants emitted from bombs exploded in the middle east and transported to the Sahara by the jet streams in that region thus affecting weather conditions WORLD WIDE So think twice before we support nuking anyone in that part of the world and  or using munitions manufactured from spent nuclear fuel
there is NO art in war...only death and destruction for ALL
Good read
Great read.
Tiny book but good reading.
clear and concise.
very thin book not alot of pages..
also chapter  the army on the march comes right after chapter  in place of chapter  
I will probably end up donating this version and purchasing a better edition for my collection.
Cool
Lil bit confusing but the chapter regarding grounds is very useful The chapter about converting spies also makes sense
Nice.
great book i loved it so much i read it from front to back in one day
it was cool
I truly enjoyed this book
It is unlike any book I have ever read
But I found so many relevancies to my career my journeys competing in pageant which is a war within itself and my life
When I heard it referenced by our President elect while I was reading it I knew I was right up there with the worlds leaders
I recommend everyone from teens to adults read this book.
A great book adapted and translated directly from the initial writing itself
As a result the text gets right to the point
No fluff filler or individual interpretation just the meat and potatoes the way this type of book should be
Substitute tanks for chariots and guns for spears and the book is easily adaptable in todays modern world.
like
this is an excellent book
highly recommended
Being a negotiation specialist and author on Amazon I read the hardcopy of this book from cover to cover
It is true that the book is celebrated as a classic written over  years ago and still on the Amazon Best Seller List Negotiation category  WOW Probably the Bible alone was more popular
And it is also true I checked that this book had influence on mostly Chinese and Japanese negotiation styles in the later part of the th century today  not really see below
But if you want to read this book in order to actually learn negotiations from it  you couldnt be more wrong with all due respect to Mr
Tzu
The Art of War is about  newsflash  how to battle your wars better as in REAL wars
Tzu was a proclaimed Chinese General from the th century BC
His book gives the best advice to the audience he intended it to be for combat Generals
He addresses issues like how to seize a fortress or city the importance of information security when is the best time to attack answer in the evening and the likes
From reading it it doesnt seem Tzu had ANY INTENTION of writing a book on negotiation and certainly makes almost NO REFERENCE to negotiations in war or elsewhere
for more on Sun Tzu  see here see httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSunTzuTheArtofWar What raises the question  HOW was this book adopted by Japanese business circles in the s and later by Chinese business culture yes in that order
The answer is that the book DOES give several tips that  IN SPIRIT  apply to negotiations
For instance he discusses the importance of preliminary preparation before going out to battle remember hes talking about making sure the soldiers weapons are intact
Does that apply to negotiations  Absolutely YES no doubt that a negotiator should be well prepared
But should he consider it a battle Well if you have done any negotiating with the Chinese or Japanese in the s as I have they possibly used to think that way but today I feel that the climate has changed
Or lets take another pearl from the book Great warlords first win the battle only then go out to combat
One would have to agree on that approach as well
But if you are a salesman who just heard his customer say that they need a  discount in order to even BEGIN negotiations on the deal  how exactly is Tzus insight helpful To summarize The Art of War is a great book for military strategy and tactics  as in West Point material
In modern business however I believe that seeing a negotiation as a combat or war will only cause loss of deals
The Chinese and Japanese are STILL skillful and tenacious negotiators but their new generation of negotiators are more western oriented and probably never read this book
I could have passes myself.
Great read you can actually learn a few things
I would recommend this book to anyone
its a very well known book.
This is indeed a great book then the ancient Chinese might not fully know what to do in warfare
But now this book as well as too many other books tells us only what to do does not tell us how to do
The issue of how to do is perhaps the most difficult point in any activity.
A must
Great read
The Giles translation of Sun Tzus classic is available for the Kindle as a free download
Click here This is the Gutenberg Project publicdomain text which these other publishers have uploaded at prices ranging from  to 
Save your money
I agree that the translation can be a bit clumsy in places but if you overlook that you can fiind some real gems inside this unusual little book
I love the relevance of so many of the concepts and every time I flick through I find a new lesson or a new way to apply the same lessons in a different context
Only fight your battles after the victory has been won
Loving it.
Its OK.
Awesome advice on everyday life
Second best book after the Bible
 Especially good at applying to work and love.
There is a reason this book has survived for centuries
One of the best strategy books ever written.
Love it
The moment that I began to read this book I began to realize how applicable it was to everything from war to business to relationships
War is in everything that we do and Sun Tzu describes perfectly how to win every battle even when you are outnumbered and outmatched.
A great read no matter if your military or not
More a look into ones self and their capabilities
Great book enjoyed reading it.
seems as this book lacks any logical order and as such offers nothing but a fuzzymessy unreadble collection of words
the introduction is  of the book an is a compliment to be called an introduction.
Everyone should read this book.
Sun Tzu is poetic in his description of war tactics
It is interesting that his tactics developed centuries  ago are applicable and relevant today
Hence an enlightened ruler is needful and a good general full of caution
This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.
The art of war is overrated
You can find a free pdf online but its not worth a read though it is worth a skim through
I you really want a book worth reading then read a book by Robert Greene
Robert Greene is a great nonfiction author and makes history interesting by deriving from it the best behaviors to achieve specific objects whether they be seduction power warfare or mastery.
book was in great condition when it arrived to my home
Love the book
easy buy.
THIS BOOK IS FULL OF GOOD ADVICE ON WAR AND DEFENSE..
Every military leader should read this book and refer to it frequently
You will be able to see clearly the cause of many of our military disasters.....
and victories.
Our political leaders need to read it
I would have to say this book makes one of my top ten list as the best books of all time.
This is a book of strategy for psychological warfareit helps you tackle the battles you face every day
One of the biggest themes is how to win a fight before it actually starts
If only our current government and military leaders had followed the wisdom of The Art of War...
Good
very interesting and now it makes it more clear the winners from the losers
GREAT PRODUCT
I feel ripped off the book is like  pages long
 I could read that in an hour
 That really isnt even fair to classify this as a book
 A real book you dont even get into it until after  pages
looking for demonstrations of the war doctrine not statues
This book is a classic  I bought and read this book out of curiosity
 It seems to me some of our recent contemporary U.S
commanders should have read this book before starting the Iraq war and taken its advise
This book is filled with strategy regarding conflict
 Some of the content is obviously way outdated.
The Art of War seems to be a classic piece of Chinese philosophy that is easy to translate into a mediocre work
 Ive read a number of translations of Sun Tzu that are clunky and have none of the wit of the original text
 Now I dont read ancient Chinese but when a Chinese philisophical text reads like a manual for a microwave you know something is lost in translation
On the other hand this translation done by Thomas Cleary showed me the subtlety in the Art of War
 In addition to the work itself which would make a very thin book there is a long interesting introduction written by the translator which I found very helpful in thinking about the Art of War as well as helping to put the work in both a historical context and the context amongst many of the other ancient Chinese philisophical works
 How Sun Tzus work relates to Taoism is very interesting
 Also there are selected commentation on each of the paragraphs of the Art of War
 These commentaries were written over different periods of time by different Chinese philosophers
 These help to show how many different points of view can exist over a single statement made by Sun Tzu
I find this translation very well done and I can easily recommend it to anyone who wants to read The Art of War.
Silly
A must read for everyone...
Absolute classic but heres the thingits not really all that relevant to todays time
 A lot of people try to turn its stories into metaphors but it seems to do its historical context a disservice.
This is a magnificent book that tells as much about psychology as it does military strategy.
Great learning about other cultures are you a lion or a fox
There was nothing extraordinary about the logic strategies and tactics he has mentioned in the book
 I would say it is a good compilation of standard practices.
So this is the great book everyone loves Its not even a book really Just a bunch of like sayings or quotations
Dont attack an army if there are more of them then there are of you
Gee thanks Dont waste your time its way overrated.
A classic
Received it in a timely and efficient manner.
This will go down as one of the all time great works by the human race
Excellent insight to the tactics in war and life
This needs to be a mandatory reed for kids in high school.
Good book
Most people dont seem to understand this book at all think it is some self help book this is not the case
It is about war.
This book is required reading for anyone interested in military history
Its very short but to the point
 It paints the profile of a Godlike commander
 Ive read it several times already
 Good read.
Insightful
Exciting always wanted a copy.
The content of the translations themselves was fine but I found the formatting difficult to read
The translator also interjects thoughts into the middle of sentences which disrupted the flow of the text even further
Other versions may be fascinating but I found this one stale and unremarkable.
To understand the motivations of politicians and corporate gamesmanship read this book.
Soft cover book nice
good conditionas advertised
I have enjoyed the book
 It has interesting ideas and concepts that I would have not understood about the warrior mind
 It was helpful for my own research
 I find it interesting that a current reality show uses this text for its show members.
I expected a full length book but a pamper with quotes
only one cd worked
The other worked fine so Ill have to give it  stars on a count that there are no half stars.
Great product
Excellent one of the best in the market for strategic thinking.
This is a magnificent book that tells as much about psychology as it does military strategy.
This is not the full works of Sun Tzu but an outline version
 Kind of like cliffnotes
 However the book isnt bad for a quick read to get the basic idea of Sun Tzus writings.
One of those books everyone who works in a competitive environment needs to read
You can apply the teachings of war to circumstances in the work place
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is an excellent book especially for those people who are in the military or law enforcement
 The language of the book refers to ancient and not modern times
 Based on my readings the author seems to be an aggressor since in modern times we strive for peace and not warlike in the ancient times.
The Chinese had warfare figured out  years ago
War has not changed enough since then to make this work irrelevant.
Written by a military strategist in ancient China this book has become the bible of different military officers in the world
the dictum of Sun Tzu which is to know your enemy won many wars.
This book is great
If you have a enemy you want to take down or a solider about to go to battle this is the book for you
It tells you everything you need to know about how to win.
The Basics
The books construct bored me
However it does have insightful information
GOOD book INSPIRING MIND GAMES I LOVED IT.
Great
Great book
Great information
One of the greatest books on strategy ever written
Need I say more
Exactly what I wanted
Fortunately I only tried the sample on my Kindle
Would have been a  loss since the text seems to be hardly edited and incomplete
The layout on the Kindle is terrible
Dontt buy this
Shame on Amazon for trying to sell such a flawed product Id rather go for a free and complete edition by Project Gutenberg
Or look for a different edition.
Very interesting
The book is very interesting but I thought the translators introduction was too long more than a quarter of the whole book.
not the same as the original
I dont know why did I buy this instead of geting a free better version
Dont make the same mistake.
My only complaint is that commentaries are interspersed within the text a bit disruptive
 However it is free and Im glad to have it in my collection.
Ive looked at  different versions of this book trying to find the best..
Or at least the one with the best reviews but they all have the same reviews
Word for word the same damn reviews
Is this just people with too much time on their hands Could someone please leave a helpful review that hasnt been posted on every other version of the art of war I seriously doubt anyone read every single version...
WTF PEOPLE.
Timeless cl.assic but no need to get a new one
Just google the art of war and you get the full text of the translation by Giles  its in public domain.
Great read
It was very informative.
The Art of War is timeless information
The rules are a plus in business and personal outlook
I recommend it.
Came in great time Russell Simmons has me thinking Vegan already only  chapter in I also watched his interviews about this book on YouTube before buying very intriguing
Do not buy this edition
This was a waste of time and money
The greatest chinese strategist immortalized his ideas in this book about war strategies and tactics
amazing books 
The book was in great shape just like new
Product was received in a timely fashion
I am very pleased with the service i received
Great job Kristin
Misspellings incorrect chapter order and apparently not full original text
Dont know how Amazon allows this
New book
Make love not war.
Excellent book.
 Check out this ebook  Success through Poetry
Im sure this is a good book but it is nearly impossible to read the Kindle edition I bought
No spacing between the words
Not very interesting
I did not like it
Sunzi did a bad job writing this book
Not made for kids or adults
I hate it.
Not what I needed but delivered promptly.
Was a gift
Came in good time
The Art of War has been the best book I have ever had the privilige of reading.
The book was very interesting
It really made look at issues in a totally different light
I love this book.
This is a good reference guide for the teachings of Sun Tzu
Straight and to the point.
This edition was published by Filiquarian Publishers and from a publishing perspective this book appears to have been designed in a basic Word processing program
Shoddy shoddy work
Lacks creative design weak choice of fonts inconsistent spacing erroneous punctuation symbols etc
Additionally one of the chapters was out of order
Im speculating that the publisher didnt know how to read roman numerals and therefore placed the chapter incorrectly and if they did and there was a purpose for this it should have been addressed in the nonexistent introduction
The content of the book is fine just buy an edition by a an established publisher rather than someone working from their basement.
I ordered my normal size and probably couldnt have worn it if I lost  lbs.
This book shows how some sexist men really thinkeven today
 Lets have womens equality now 


everywhere
No wonder we have had centuries of wars
War is not the only solution but it is all too often the kneejerk reaction of a sexist society with likeminded male leaders in charge
Even though this book represents thinking from long ago it still reflects the sexist combative male psyche and primal need to dominate rather than cooperate which is still fostered and rewarded in business today
It explains why women do not get ahead in business after countless years and many decades of demonstrated ability and superior management skills
 The masters house will not be destroyed with the masters tools
This book is a sad reflection on life.
why is this not avaliable in the asia pacific region I mean come on its hundreds of years old and in the public domain why cant i get the kindle edition
Sun Tzus the art of war is one of the most overrated books in terms of content
It is not that the writer is wrong about most subjects though a lot is hopelessly outdated
The problem is that any  year old who has played with toy soldiers enough could have written this book without the fancy words or synonyms
Dont attack when outnumbered with the sun in your face etc etc
The very basics of battles not even of warfare
True warfare now and then relies more on logistics with the battles being just a small part of war
So if you are completely ignorant of battles and war and simple logic you can read this book and be satisfied
However if you are truely interested in the art of war then read the book with that same name from Machiavelli.
Arrived quickly and in perfect condition
 Great price.
Not just about war but rather every challenging aspect of your life.
Nice
Great book and strategies that can not only help you in war but in life.
This is not the original writing
Someones notes sold as real
The cons of amazon ratings
Great
As described
AOK
Awesome book
A Total Must Read The Art Of WarGood Buy At A Good Price.
This is actually a poorly produced pamphlet some twenty odd pages  unfortunately the advertisement does not state this fact
Please note...this is not the full version of the book but a very heavily abridged version of approximately  pages in very large print
To read from cover to cover takes about  minutes
The seller does not make this clear
In my opinion this book is an absolute rip off.
The Art of War the book itself needs no further presentation by now as a beautiful example of the art of printing
Very happy with the hardcover pocketsize edition by Arcturus Publishing Limited.
Of course that is a classic
I have to say that I feel a little uncomfortable with the concept of always thinking about winning the battle
I can appreciate the benefits of mastering those principles for anyone engaging in battles politics economics socials..
but unless it is the last option I prefer to engage with others thinking winwin
I will certainly read that book a few more times this year and in the years to come
As a classic it is worth reading it as for its daily use I guess it is needed to read it over and over so it gets easier to really understand the principles and understand how to apply them correctly in our everyday life.
I didnt notice this was the chump change edition aka the abridged version
I got it in hardcover as well
Can you imagine a hardcover pamphlet  pages
Its quite funny
Not a total wast of money but not what I was expecting as this information in not apparent in the item description.
The kindle version has some formatting issues but forget about that
The key here is that the rules of war are set very well
In essence war is about strength and strength comes in many forms not just numbers
The book explains how to measure strength and this applies to your enemy as well as yourself
If you are strong pretend to be weak
If you are weak pretend to be strong
As a rule nobody attacks a foe whose strength is unknown so if you remain a mystery to your enemy they are unlikely to attack
Such an interesting read with great examples from history
Recommended reading.
The Art of War is the surprisingly succinct classic of military literature attributed to Sun Tzu
No one knows exactly when The Art of War was written but it was collected around the th Century CE
Regardless of your interest in military strategy this short collection of proverbs and idioms is worth the time it takes to read
The lessons can be broad and universally applied to daily life especially in business and career terms.
this book was great
i am currently using some tactics learnt from within the book against a brand named pro rep
they have a product which i would rather have received a bag of cow feces
cow feces doesnt give cancer to children.
I love this book
If you read it less from a military tactician perspective and more an evaluation of life it somehow seems to make more sense to me at least.
This classic book has been renowned for centuries but it doesnt get old
The advice it contains is wise and can be applied to modernday life including the workplace
It is not just a book about war and warfare but about an approach to life
The translation is well done.
Amazing product The quality is Brilliant and i will definitely recommend this to my family and friends to enjoy i cannot recommend this highly enough this is a must have Excellent seller with fast delivery time and also great customer service.
I thoroughly enjoyed this read
The book made me think a lot more than I expected
It is a good read for one sitting or over a few
I would highly recommend the read to all and I am certain you will enjoy your time with this book.
Interesting ideas
 I hope to implement some of them in our cricket league next year
This is a classic that I have wanted to read for a while
It was different than I had expected but in a good way in that it advocates diplomacy over conflict any day
Very interesting indeed.
Got the BN Leatherbound pocket edition of this book the book is presented beautifully and feels very well made unlike some other BN Leatherbound editions this one feels far more substantial and the leather a bit thicker
Sewn pages and thick binding make this feel great in the hands
This edition is definitely my favourite choice of the Art of War
This edition is for children I guess
 Its a reprint and the entire importance and it being an ancient manuscript is lost with its font and general print ..should always recheck the edition before purchasing
The formatting for this Kindle version is terrible and the academic narrative jumps from one thread to another without much explanation of the scholars characters and time frames involved
It really did not provide me with what I was after a clearly contextualized narrative of The Art of War
Thankfully this purchase was cheap.
In case youre expecting a thick tome or a novel its basically a superthin supersimple pamphlet guide
That being said its riveting
Each lesson makes you stop and think and while Im not a very philosophical or meditative person I found myself musing on the various rules of war and how they apply to my personal and professional life
A bargain buy
I take this into everyday living it does make you think from a different perspective.
Just as expected and well packed
Arrived three days later than predicted but it is Black Friday week so not surprised
Interesting treatise on strategy of war.
Very interesting as to the mind of someone who seeks every possibility and prepares for every eventuality when war may ensue
I bought this expecting some large thickness paper back but its only mm or so thick with a typeface more akin to infant school readers
Brought for a  friend
Having heard about this work many times getting a copy has pleased me a lot you will understand that the work needs interpreing to your situation and this can be sales management planning .......
All the way to child care and relationships  people havent changed that much reading through you will find your boss  mates  partner  they are all there and laid bare possibly even you  cant recommend highly enough
As headline describes this is a very brief book compared to the original one.
should be specified better in description as the text in description box references  chapters quite alot for a  page book
I sent it back to get the full translated version
Short version of the book but worth the money
Its very interesting the way both the psychological and strategical methodologies are outlined in this book
It really is a good read.
This is the second time I have read this book and still find it fascinating
It is concise split into easy to read sections and although it was intended to provide strategies for success in battle there are people management techniques that apply today.
One of those books you just have to read to say you have
However it is a very difficult read
Not for the faint of heart.
A classic that everyone should read.
A book written by a legend this might teach you a thing or two if youre into total war games
Great book a must have classics if your life goals are world domination
This book set the base for modern EQ theories
Interesting book but it does state the obvious
Impressed that this was written so long ago and still have value.
An interesting read even if I will not use it in my life that much
A classic that must be read
Downloads well
definitely helpful for writing can see myself referencing this a lot in future with some of my WIPs
Really nice colours and book that we all no and loce
Very informative book can be applied to many current daynon war situations
Some very basic spelling grammar errors which need correcting.
Know your enemy know yourself and you shall be victorious
Good book to read better book to reflect on.
Great
I read this as a modernday analogy for business conduct and to see what all the buzz was about
First of all it is extremely short you will polish it off in a single sitting for sure
Secondly I can see how some people suggest this for modern times however I personally would not
The book is too focused on actual battle and very high level tactics
It would seem that many of the other similar but more targeted books in this category would do a better job for what I was looking for.
It is worth a read
Principles can probably be applied to other areas of life.
Its a pamphlet
Its a must read a classic
Very thin reading
Holiday stuff.
Very good with good explanatory notes by the compiler.
Individual taste but enticing for people who love control
Good
Good book
Wise words
Quick reading and a lot to meditate on
Translation is clear enough for the average person.
If youd like to gain some more insight into this famous book buy this
Its a little straight forward more like bullet points than an instructive book
worth the price.
A brilliant book well worth reading
Ranks alongside I Ching and Machiavellis  The Prince
As a book all entrepreneurs need to read.
Simple structured book
It makes you wonder how people lose wars when there is a manual on how to do it right like this
Its not like its big to carry round or difficult to understand
It just shows how thick warmongers are.
A
One of these books you should read
It is quoted in dozens of TV programmes and novelsm from Star Trek to the sopranos
I didnt manage to finish all of it
A friend rex reading it
Its an interesting read but I feel I had to be in the right frame of mind to digest it
Inspiring read filled with lots of strategic advice.
Great delievery
Great book and good read
It might just help you in your day to day life to win your own wars in which we all fight each day
The translation is loose but your mind gets used to it K RADNG numbers and letters together
You get to grips with it.
A classic book i wanted to read although not a great read more like a list of observations I am  glad i read it different
Good Read
Good
Everyone should read this if only for the wisdom imparted for life
 Readers should not contemplate war on reading this easy to read user friendly manual.
Havent read it yet so why bothering me about review when I didnt even finish the first chapter Should be prompted in the middle not here.
Excellent 
An Ancient book on the dynamics of war understandably dated but also timeless in principal
If you like the title you will like the read.
This is one of those classics that is a must have for a bookcase
Its not as long as I thought but it does make you think
This book is very easy to quote and has lessons that extend much father than the world of conflict
This is a must read for everyone.
Wonderful classic to have in my possession.
Quite brief not really what I expected.
good
Somewhat philosophical in places but an invaluable insight into the Chinese mind
 Very interesting once you get through the heavy bits.
Classical text well explained
Fascinating to read
I am still enjoying every bit of it
Perfect Kindle read
I would recommend this to anyone.
Not read this book yet but I like the picture on the front of the book
Worth buying for that reason alone
As good as new
Very good quality
The translation is very good
I liked it
totally worthwhile read just for the philosophy
still valid today maybe not for war but how to deal with work etc
Fantastic book.
A classic of course and rightly so
Easy to read but it takes time to digest properly.
It is a short book written by a successful Chinese general from thousands of years ago I finished it in just one day
Even with its terse content it is hard to summarize in a short blog post due to its diverse structure
Each of its chapters provides bulletpoint lists of militarygrade advicegood advice no doubt but not the stuff from which movie scripts are drawn.
Worth a read to show that strategy and tactics have not changed too much over the centuries
Exactly what its supposed to be
awesome book
Love this book its a must read
Definitely up there with the  books to read before you die
An old classic.
great seller.
timely delivery smooth transaction..recommend seller
Poorly printed and badly outlined
I love the book and was hoping for a beautiful hard cover but was left disappointed unfortunately...
Great book can be applied to lifes experience in a multitude of different ways
Thoroughly recommend.
Good read
Im not really someone that makes war and this was useful for me as well
I found the chapter on laying plans particularly good
a good book broken down into good sized chapter for some great light reading
it is good for those small journeys
Interesting to look at the knowledge and tactics used at such an early moment in history
Worth reading if youre interested in early Chinese history.
Very easy to read and thought provoking when dealing with politics within your business or personal life
I have really enjoyed reading this book.
Loved it
Interesting insight into military tactics
good
son liked it a lot D
Nice book to read and also a cool addition to your library.
I enjoyed reading this book
As an introduction into the Art of War it is brilliant
I spent a lot of time reflecting on my own experiences whilst reading this.
as described good read
Great
A classic for any military student
jh
Very Good book bought it just because its recomended for life
Tedious.
Excellent Product Fast Delivery Reasonable Price.
highly recommended
If you havent read it yet read it
Truly a timeless book.
Great read
Hugely insightful and full of common sense ideas that still translate into the modern world
Would recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a quick think about strategy and leadership.
Delivered in timely manner and good quality
Exactly as described and arrived on time
THE ANCIEN WISDOM OF CHINA STILL PREVAILING TODAY....A MUST 
Great read
Teaches discipline could easily save your life having read this book.
Brilliant and very helpful.
amazing fast delivery great seller A
Interesting
 Still relevant to modern warfare  N
B
 Blair  bush .simple  but clear  worth a read thats all B
Love it
Great product  would buy again.
Very Interesting
However didnt realise that the book was full of very short ideas and comments
Nevertheless can see why this would be popular for those in need of strategic ideas.
Love this book.
A most definite read.
good book about life in general
have only read bits of it so far.
Well packaged Great Edition of the Art Of War
I always love this book
there is nothing to doubt about the content
absolutely almost the same like the hardcover version like i used to hve
Sun Tzu still reads well even thought it is older than the Bible
Worth a read for any budding capitalist
Not very exciting.
very interesting book
inspiring
good
I can see why this has been such a stalwart of military strategy for so long
Insightful and clever
Loved it
Very informative book for military colleges and officer training schools explains how to become a military leader I recommend the book if you are curious about military runs.
Excellent Product  Delivery
Have had a previous version and wanted to read it again
Very applicable methodologies and techniques for the current business world.
Excellent 
A good piece of classic literature that considering when it was written is still surprisingly relevant
A few mistakes have been made in this translation nothing huge though.
Its a classic Ive read many times before and a free download just cant turn down.
Reasonable price and fast delivery
A very good read.
If your a team leader and want to know how to lead your team read this book
Somethings never change
I had heard about this book in particular for a long time and had it recommended so I finally got myself a copy and I think it is a great book excellent read
Very happy.
Awesome book
Thanks all good and a great read whichever iteration you pick up
Gave it as a gift and they were absolutely thrilled
great service cant fault it
It is not advertised that this is a condensed version of the book.
Ever been screwed over read this one and you will see it before it comes
It therefore will not happen again.
Not the actual book
Do not buy.
Its a classic  a must have Great Read
This is a faithful adaptation of The Art Of War very readable and incredibly relevant even now
This is one of those books everyone should read.
Classic
Thia book is very educational and made easy as there is an explanation for every extract of the art of war however if you know the meaning you can continue to read in bold
This book has taught me so much about life work
You can translate it all into success in business
Excellently written and full to the brim of amazing references
One I shall definitely keep revisiting.
Quality of book not as good seems like theres alot missing.
was okay.
New one.
intersting
A lot of it seems obvious but its a great tool
Very well laid out easy to read recommended for any body keen on deepening their understanding of basic principles.
Love it
Good read in the main
Liked it to dip in and out of randomly between other books
Plenty to make you think
The printed MRP is  and I got it at 
Delivery from Amazon was as usual good
Now talking about the book I think its the most overated book that I have read so far
 So my suggestion would be not to waste time on this
It is written point wise that also for me seems a little childish
It talks about different tactics of warfare which is completely irrelevant in todays time
One atom bomb and all your Art of War would go in vain
I though of giving it  stars but the reviews that is there on the cover of the book is so very good that it made me give it  star
Also comparing it with Gita is complete insult to human civilization
Rest I would say if you have a lot of time and want to waste it and get angry after few days then I would suggest you to go for this.

Very good
Brilliant insight into war strategy and the mind of a war strategist.
Nice one
interesting but hard to context for me
Good book with some great ideas
A great read deserving of its acclaim
A must read for the contemporary master
An echo of the past resonating true to the modern application of force and subterfuge.
Good
I know feel that I posess the tactical knowledge and the logistics of warfare to help me conquer my neighbouring province
Heil Sun Tzu
exactly what I was expecting a book to make you think
very good
Out of all the books involving philosophy this is the most interesting one.
Great translation
Great book.
I was expecting as indicated in the free miniafter purchase version of the book a conversion of the tales and events of Sun Tzu and his tact
But was highly disappointd to see that this was nothing more than a bland version of do this
Do that in a war scene
Timely delivered
Timely returned
Dont understand why it has such high ratings.
Its the nd Gita Quran  Bible Granth Sahib whatever is yours And if you want to be successful in any field then this book will fire up your mind
But let me tell you one thing.....
Its a book that basically gives you instructions instructions on how to fight a war and win
Its not that kind of book that makes every instruction simpler by explaining it with a lot of examples It makes sense when you consider the fact that it was written by Sun Tzu thousands of years ago
Its just the instructions.....
Thats it
So you may find it a little difficult to relate it to circumstances in your life
So while reading the book power on your creative mind and try relating each instruction to your everyday use
I bet its going to be a brainstorming session and whats more....
Youll love it
Must read for business folks 
Know thine enemy...
Like it
Great
When you start reading it it looks brilliant
It appears Sun Tzu was brilliant strategist
But these idiotic mental war fare and win a war without actually fighting it just makes an army lazy
This book is the reason for China losing almost every war after SUN TZU era...lost from Mongols..
Europe divided China as a Mellon
And lost from Japanese Russians Americans Vietnamese and more to come if they do not destroy this book.
Book looks and feels cheap but the translation is very good The choice of words is precise yet predictable and is neither archaic nor new age
Each passage is translated in such a way to make the message directly accessible in English
There are no footnotes which is something I wanted but there is a very good and lengthy introduction.
Received the book in bad condition
The front cover was crampled and there were dents over the cover and sides as well
Quality was not adequate
Moreover the book original price was INR  and not INR  as claimed
This the discounts stated was also not correct.
So i read this book a number of times before i finally began to decode it and well safe to say its full of gems
Im not a very manipulative person by nature but have had many run ins over my short life span with people of this nature which has very much contributed to myself being trod all over
Reading this book really put into perspective many aspects of human behaviour and well quite frankly highlighted the characteristics of a narcissist and potential methods to counteract it
There are many scenarios in the book which I dont see myself using however being new to the business world i definitely know that i will be revisiting the book numerous times
To put it simply take this book with a grain of salt and interpret it as you wish but regardless of the extent to which you relate to it  simply learning of the true essence of war makes it an interesting read nonetheless Also regarding the product  it is quite thin and condensed i wish there was more room to annotate it as i was cramming sentences between lines by the end of it and a book of this sort definitely needs annotation  but it did arrive fast and as pictured a steal for the price
Well book
The book is very short concise and one seating read which can at max take  hours
Insights are good but somehow translation seems off the target
If you are familiar with war terminology and scenarios then definitely go for this book but if its your first book in the domain of strategy building and decision making then go for the book with explanation of each tactic given in simple language and analogy many of these books are available on Amazon itself.
You may be wondering why I have picked such a title for this review and there is a very good reason for it
 Written well over a thousand years ago Sun Tzus tactical guide to war is still used and taught in military schools and has found more applications over the centuries
The tactics laid out here were used in historical battles fought in Asia and China but they were also used by Ninjas and intelligence services
 Nowadays still used by the military and intelligence worlds they have found a place in business
 Why this is so is firstly because it isnt long to read it isnt hard to read and it is reliable information
 If you use a bit of thought then you can apply the teachings of Sun Tzu in your life as and when necessary
 Of course although being short this does make you use your brain and think and this in itself can make you come up with ideas how to apply the teachings here
 This is a must read for those who study  military tactics and military history as well as businessmen and those who want to be one step ahead of the game
 Ultimately this is the classic for all and hopefully can help you in unforeseen ways and in many situations.
El libro son parrafos sueltos sin ningun tipo de analisis aadido y no demasiado bien estructurados
Como si alguien hubiera juntado los apuntes en un panfleto tipo chuleta la noche antes de un examen
Bastante pauperrimo aunque el precio est bien yo no lo recomendaria.
Nice book for leadership strategy  knowledge but little disappointed with book size  just summary of points no explanation.
The book is great and there are some amazing tactics that can be used in our everyday modern life
However few points are very contradicting to the actual meaning in the book
Its a must read book but not worth the hype people have created
 stars because of multiple contradictory sentences maybe the actual meaning could be lost in the translation
Thanks to Amazon and the seller for quick delivery and reasonable pricing.
This is probably one of the best versions of the Art of War ive seen anyway
It basically gives some analysis and goes into depth on what Sun Tzu means using some ancient Chinese commentators as references and examples to better explain the teachings
I would have given this  stars but its layed out strangely
Youll find pages with  sentence that seem continue on the next page but its tolerable given the depth which the researcher explains things
I have  different versions of the Art of War
One is a thin  page pamphlet the second has some artwork included but this version includes more than just Sun Tzus teachings on certain topics
As a result its more enjoyable to read than a list of bulletpoints and much more informative.
Die Geschichten in dem Buch kann man gut auf Alltagssituationen berleiten und gut in das tglich Leben einbauen so dass man eine Strategie entwickeln kann
Das Buch hilft einem dazu sehr.
I would like to thank Sun Tzu for giving the world a masterpiece to apply techniques that will give you success to achieve higher purpose in life
Though this book is about war strategies Sun Tzu mentions war is not good for nation at large and we need to find out way to win without a fight
Should we apply that to our lives we are mostly bogged down by little things that upsets us unnecessarily all we need to do is move ahead and move inch close to our vision each day.
The book has been written in a clear and easy to understand bullet points format
Each statement carries a weight to it and needs to be thought over before proceeding
Highly recommended to those who are involved in any kind of competition conflict resolution  or to people in public administration
Definitely a classic
A great book but I thought initially about it would be a self help book but could not get to the point as expected but one can relate the points mentioned in the book with ones life when he or she tries to see life or simply challenges of life as just enemy otherwise the book is mainly focused on war stuffs like that of army and all..
The kindle version of this book is absolutely unreadable
So many OCR errors I cant even come close to getting in to a flow counted  or so on a single page
Even if free this is inexcusable at least run it through a spell check....
Really great book
Good book to learn about Strategy
Simple and quick to read
Strategies are written point wise so it is easy to read and learn
All the necessary strategies which are required to know are in this book
Like the Newsweek quote Absorb this book you can throw out all those contemporary books about management leadership  Book was a excellent condition
 Brand new.
Very glad I purchased this book
Its actually  books in one
Very good condition and a very attractive book
One of my faves and a important book to have in your library
Not only does it contain The Art of War but it also has the Tao Te Ching.
Das Buch ist von historischem Wert und Inhalt
Die beschriebenen Empfehlungen sind auch heute noch von Relevanz zur Unternehmensfhrung entweder als gutes oder schlechtes Beispiel und dienen auch um chinesische Philosophien und Denkweisen zu verstehen
Allerdings ist die Formatierung und bersetzung ausgesprochen schlecht Seitenzahlen fehlen ebenso fehlt ein Inhalts oder Stichwortverzeichnis
Es ist unklar wo bersetzt wird und wo Kommentare oder andere Zitate eingefgt wurden
Die Kapitelberschriften lassen sich kaum vom Flietext unterscheiden.
This book is of no use
It is just a summary or headlines of the actual book
serves no purpose to the reader
Excellent read
I got to know about this book from the infamous movie Wall Street starring Michael Douglas as a charismatic business leader in which he quotes Sun Tzu Every battle is won even before it is fought
A definite on must reads
Everyone should read this book once in their life
Many lessons learned.
I thought the book would be about how to win wars giving example from past and how to improve but it is step by step guide about preparation of war
Not what I expected.
This book by sun tzu teaches a lot about ancient warfare and is quiet interesting
But it not only tells about that it tells how to understand and control the actions of other
The way to influence them and to use advantages efficiently
It is a fun short book with a little bit of history and philosophy.
Print is proper and readable easy on eyes
Almost error free too so if you want to read this book can go for this print version.
Pas dintroduction de gnral de larme US de la seconde guerre mondiale ou plus rcent dont jai rien  faire et qui na aucun rapport avec Sun Tzu pas de prface jonche de poncifs marketing enrobs de superlatifs ronflants juste le texte dorigine traduit avec des polices de caractres trs lisibles et trs agrables  la lecture
Tout ce que japprcie ne changez rien parfait 
Contains summarized quotations
Go for book that contain the context also
The work of Sun Tzu needs no endorsement  it is a timeless classic
 This print itself is quite good
 Its a small pocketbook with good paper and good printing
 Priced very reasonably worth the buy
A bit dated
I bought this based on many reviews which said that its still relevant today
I am not sure if I picked up the wrong translation but there are not many words of wisdom that I found which is applicable today.
May be this books is amazing for people who are in defence services but i wasnt able to connect to it
This book has war lessons in form of quotes and reading them feels like there is no link to those quotes and your life
This book is still the demograph for all armies today the fascinating ideal however is its use in day to day life the use of mentalism and not only knowing your enemy but also weighing up daily trials...
The book contains Only tips and instructions
You have to use your mind to understand it in modern context with your examples
You need to think
The quality of pages was good but the page color is yellow
I bought the fingerprints publishing version.
I just had to have this book especially at this low price
 I couldnt go wrong
 Very interesting
Very compact and complete
 A book used through the ages
 Most insightful.
Non solo un trattato di arte militare
questo  un libro di strategie applicabili in senso esteso a tutte le situazioni della vita ed  anche unottima lettura.
Even though this timeless piece is a dedicated guidebook to waging war a lot of the verses can be applicable in every day life
 Really its a book of strategy and understanding human nature
 A great short read
Very happy it was delivered in the afternoon with a very professional servicebook is awesome
This pocket book is great for a quick read
The entire book is in the form of notes with bitesize pieces of information
Quite an easy read.
It looks like a cheap knock off of the art of war
Translation is subpar organisation of topics is also poor
It feels boring to read and kills the interest of reader very quick
Go for some other publication.
San Tzu is really a genius who knows whos who of the war
The art of war is a bundle of knowledge which is necessary in the contemporary world
It is not only meant to deal a war but to deal with your day to day situations
You will find an opportunity in every crisis after reading this book.
This is a very good book
Its recommended for reading in military academies all over the world
But  years after it was written the book is more philosophy than military tactics
Reading it will motivate you and increase your morale
So give it a try.
Un genio assoluto per lepoca in cui scriveva Un must per chiunque voglia ottenere qualcosa nella vita.
This book is not subjective its in bullet points but gives the whole crux of the book Recommended for not so bibliophiles
Bo idea why this is so well rated..
thats like a pamphlet nothing more
dont waste your time
Art of war In the war which kind of action u have to take How to deal with another soldier of another team
it is a small book with great deal of knowledge
if one can absorb the content well then heshe can easily surpass knowledge of present leadership books inmarket.
Cant access in ebook
Lost this in cyberspacecloud
Cant appreciate the book.
Its simplicity because of points make it very interesting read
Dieses Buch ist sogar recht unterhaltsam geschreiben und hat einen hohen psychischen Anspruch wenn man wirklich versucht die Argumente des Autors zu reflektieren.
Written  B.C
read by many historical figure
This book helped solved more conflicts in history than weapons
Everyone should read it to learn how to think and resolve conflicts of all magnitudes
This book is one of the real classic old time book
which invokes the reader attention especially if one is interested in military.
The content is great but the quality of paper couldve been better.
An absolutely wonderful insight with a age defying knowledge
A must read for people from all walks of professional life
It doesnt even cost that much
You can finish it within one hour
So what are you waiting for
A most excellent gift for the interested son.
I should have read the reviews first before buying
It is only  pages a basic summary of points and rules
Too bad I always wanted to read this full book obviously.
With all due respect to the great author English interpretation not up to the mark
Not worth a read.
Very disappointing for the price
 The book is A and the cover is not the quality described
 For  I expected something of higher quality ..
not a notebook equivalent.
the timeless masterpiece of work and mind power to achieve success and a higher level of peace of mind
this book is based on old strategies and methodologies which are timeless and can be implemented in present and future aswell
highly recommended reading this
SUN TZU  you genius warrior
awesome book quality pages
THIS BOOK IS SHEISTY  PAGES OF PURE FINESSE
BUY THE ORIGINAL BC THIS ONE IS A PAMPHLET 
In most cases this translation is easy to understand
In my opinion the book would have been better though if it was translated in a slightly more modern way
Nevertheless it is still a very good book
I think that one of the strong points about this book is that its contents is very well organised which makes it easier read as opposed to other translations out there where the contents of the chapters are poorly structured  are mixed along with some comments made by someone else not by Sun Tzu which for me can get pretty annoying...
Its not even a book its look like a short notes for the actual book.
dont get fooled by the price
Super Buch
Fr den Kindle sehr gut formatiert
Viele Kriegsfhrungstipps die sich als SelbsthilfeTricks verwenden lassen.
Best book I ever read till now 


Must read 
Its a little bit on tactics to win a war in ancient time
I dont know if you can use it in todays time
But nice and easy read
It was cheap so I bought it.
My dad always said that this book is a most for everyone and can be applied to almost everything
I think you can enjoy it and learn at least a little of this book
Ive redR the book which is must for indians keep inspiring all time and book is short simple like hand book cheap at its information Before waste in some other novels waste it for practically possible way
Wanted to have a copy and read this classic it got here in time with no problems worth a read.
One of the most interesting reads youll come across.
Doesnt look relevant in todays context....translation to english is also problem
Its just the plain translation of manuscript...only  pages most of the verses as literally translated do not hold any meaning in English
Worst  rupees ever spent
Wish i can sue amazon for this stupid book
Please please do not buy.Due to this i have lost trust on online book buying.
Teaches life lesson
I purchased  books in one lot
Only  reached
I did not challenge because other  was useful to me and returning the entire lot did not seem a good option.
Excellent book.
Waow...reached one day earlier before delivery date thanks Amazon didnt expected wonderful..
and also product is in awosome condition light weight and good quality material and printing.i recommend it go for it.
I personally feel that...people who are mature enough will find this book enhancing their personality traits at the end of the day.
Very good book to understand the todays world form this old theories
shorter than I expected but I am not sure if that is just the book or if this is just a short version
Just what it promised...
The art of war is still aplliacable to warfare as well as anything competitive
Like in corporate ladder climbing.
This book details out the various strategies as part of defendingattacking for a force
 However everything described is ever relevant in everyday management context
Read this book and apply it to your life
Liked the way Sun Tzu explains the importance and power of earth and heaven and how to use them for ur benefit.
tima leitura para se colocar em prtica na vida pessoal nos negcios e em tantos outros nveis sociais que devemos enfrentar para alcanar nossos objetivos.
A Masterpiece  Those who plan for their future will get entire benefit from this book if he implement his recommendations and acts on it 
Otherwise it will be mere historical account for you 
A good read.
So good 
Only pages  cm dimensions Worth rs Total fraud loot macha rakhi h I rode this book in hour

Supongo que lo recomiendo
Me faltaba una palabra hehe
A Classic book about Military Warfare
Thanks to Amazon and Fingerprint for the low price
Nice large texts
Book is very nicely written
I totally enjoyed it.
Overly concise
Avid readers may not like this compressed version.
Its interesting that Sun Tzu understood human nature so well long before the behavioural sciences explained so many puzzling characteristics
Nice read
Good ancient tricks n tips
Not of much use in present form of combats
But felt can apply many things in day to day life
This is a very helpful book
However due to the fact that it is a pocket edition this is not a complete book but a very well detail summary version of book
Love this product
The insights in this book can be applied to business life sports relationships and other ventures
Id recommend this book to anyone wanting to reach success learn how to think thoroughly and rationally to achieve your objectives.
People will always disagree but getting through the disagreement without the massive collateral damage that goes with conflict is a much undervalued approach
Sun Tzu offers insightful advice to help master those anxieties manage your resources towards peace of mind and to end disagreement in the most decisive and holistic manner possible so that life can return to its normal routine of tea and cake
He may be cunning shrewd devious and even ruthless but without his nocompromise approach to obtaining peace well.
you may well find out why one should never fight a land war in asia
INSPIRATIONAL STRATEGIC CONCEPTUAL ON THE BASIS OF PRACTICAL EXPRIENCE
While the book is widely overrated the format of the book looks cheap and not being looked after.
Good book  things written in the qoutes style language is easy one can easily understand it.
The book is amazing and very much precise about what it wants to convey .
Interesting reading but nowadays only a few fight face to face most just push a button in Washington DC.

Looks like some cheap translation from Chinese
English is of poor quality.
A simple Plain Translation
Would have been happy if it had made the reader understand the meaning with an explanatory note.
Not recommended to buy this book.
Old words of wisdom that still holds true in the modern world  Every work or project is like war.
Good print.Good packaging.
No..
Very relevant even thousands of years later
Helpful guidance dealing with daily challenges.
Very good condition
Good book for learning tactics
being a teacher I find this volume the most essential text on pedagogy
When I first started my campaign against unruly classroom behaviour I found that although I would win the occasional battle the overall war was being lost
But now I command my room with absolute certainty getting to know my pupils and in the process of doing that I have come to know myself I need not fear the outcome of a thousand battles.

Faulty translation and many errors resulting in an unreadable text no sources or introduction
Theres a better version online for free legal.
True content to the original piece of art
Excellent theory to apply both in the past present and even future.
It is summary not actual book
best war strategic book ever
Excellent paper quality and printing
Very good book...
great read
good book for managers
For a book written thousands of years ago its quite easy to follow and its split up very nicely into small chapters and the chapters are split into bullet points
I found myself reading a chapter whenever I had a spare few minutes its great to have in your library and its definitely a must read.
This is not good what we expected
Great quality Freshly printed
High quality book.
Good read
worth the price.
fast shipping
Overall very satisfied.
Nice Book...But Delivery Was  days late.
Great quick read
Great book.
Great book
Interesting....
I imagine the practicality of this book in  is more sentimental rather than implementable
But worth the read no less.
Its a copy version of the original book...basically summarizes in bad English the teachings or theories of sun tzu...its not the real book as written by sun tzu...
Fantastic classic
 Well worth a read even in our modern age there is much that can be applied to everyday life
Its as though we are living in a war but not realising it for what it is...
If I could score this book 
I would of
It is interesting I personally enjoyed reviews of the book more than the book particularly reviews found on youtube
But the book itself I found just OK.
This is a decent version of a classic text
Its well laid out with a table of contents making it easy to dip in and out
The ideas and strategies are individually explained in a couple of sentences prompting the reader to muse over the ideas and gain a deeper understanding of the concepts
Originally written over a thousand years ago the timeless wisdom contained in this gem by Sun Tzu has been utilised by many military and business menwomen for profitable advantage
This Kindle version of The Art of War contains reliable insights and strategies that you can put to practical use in your daily life in an easily digested readable format
Colin G Smith author of Difficult People Dealing With Difficult People At Work Quick Start Guide
nothing new
all obvious but how do you do it when it counts
A must have book for all the book enthusiasts out there
This edition is having the genuine translation by Sun Tzu without any interference editing by other authors
I would recommend this book only as there as various editions available in the market
Prompt delivery by Amazon and the quality of book is also top notch
I would insist amazon to include bookmarks with all the orders of books made from their site.

The title says it all
A work in translation
I suspect much has been lost in translation but the book is centuries old so it may be dated now
Im not sure as Im not a military person and so may not be the best person to review this book
I thought it would apply to business
Some very clever points in it though and I am aware this book is a classic of its kind
Well known especially by scholars.
Very interesting
How can I A mere blockhead describe the greatness of this masterpiece written by a genius All I can say is go ahead  purchase this book
I promise that you wont be disappointed
Hats off to Finger Print Publishers
This is my third purchase with them after  The Three Musketeers   The Great Gatsby And Im an happy customer  a huge fan
Thank you so much guys My heartfelt gratitude.
It is not the actual book but a snippet from the original
The whole book is just numbered quotes
Coming to the content the book talks about the strategies they use in wars which can be used for business strategies
But without the proper context the points lack punch and not clear sense can be made out of the book
I bought the book for  bucks which was a cool deal
D
This book is a complete package for enhansing life skills
Dissapointed that the selling price in amazon was more than the MRP tag on the back of the book cover its clearly written as Rs  but bought it for Rs 
Overall its a useful product.
MAY BE BECAUSE THE BOOK IS A SHORT VERSION IT GAVE LITTLE NEW INSIGHTS THOUGH IN ITS TIME IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY USABLE
THE SAYINGS OF CHANAKYA IN INDIA ARE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE.
I was given this book to read as part of my black belt preparation and .u st admit that it is one of the hardest books I have ever read along with The Book of Five Rings
I did not like the way this book was written as it it set out in short bullet point paragraphs however I can understand why this book is still used in modern times as a lot of it can be adopted in other ways other than martial arts
I am glad I read this book but the way it was written has made me award this book only  stars.
I hoper for a slightly more serious version of the book
There are many pictures and the pages have many weird distracting ornaments on the sides
I would recommend a different version of the book e.g
by Penguin
This book is ideal for someone who just wished for a hardcover version of this text without any expectations concerning the design and the book cover
 stars for the great source material and the okayish cover.
The book was delivered on time
The quality of paperback is ok
The book is filled with aphorisms related to war
It would be difficult to imagine the entire meaning of the aphorism and relate it to the current times
I would not recommend this version of the book to people who are looking forward to learn some incisive principles of challenges in life that are analogous to war.
Contents are ok but lots of typos and amateurish layout
Size is bigger than A size making it impractical to read.
Its all about strategy
Be it war or rat race of the modern world.
chatpers are point wise like in chaper  there are say  points likewise
there are no paragraphs so there is limited explaination may be its the way original book is written 
now this is both poistive as its succint with clearly stating the point
but sometimes one seeks more explaination in depth to certain points
Quality of book  its good at this price point  while i am being more demanding and want to have price lower than  because its thin book but knowledge in those pages may be worth more but i am looking from no of pages  quality of pages  ink needed to print from that point of view it can be sold lesser than  also  comment i guess a commentary book or essay book on this book or critic book on this book needs to be read to gain the indepth meaning of the points discussed in book
so that tactics used in the book can be used in other spheres  without actual war on land  final words must buy  read and gift 
Hatte deutlich mehr erwartet relativ zerstckelt hat mir nicht wirklich gefallen hatte mehr Hintergrund zur asiatischen lebenskultur und ggf
geschichtlichem erwartet vielleicht zu hohe Ansprche gehabt
Not what I had expected
Print quality is poor as well as the content seems to be pirated.
Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak
Delivered right on time.
Good book..All about war..But logical so you can actually link some things you read to real life scenarios
Good to know in case you plan to command a medieval army someday.
     CAO CAO 
Mgen sie Militr Eigentlich spielt es keine Rolle Der Klassiker in Sachen Taktik und strategie hat viel zu bieten egal in welchem Umfeld man sich bewegt
Die Ansichten zu Informationen und ihrer Bewertung sind ungeahnt aktuell und zhlen zum kompaktesten was mir je untergekommen ist
Auch wenn die Sprache ein bisschen angestaubt liest  es ist auf jeden Fall Zeit und Geld wert.
Very Good for a strategist looking for an opportunity how administrations is Done in any field or situation
Es war ein sehr einfach gehaltener Schreibstil Inhaltlich beraus interessant doch leider kam es mir persnlich sehr kompakt vor
Man verschlingt das Buch frmlich in wenigen Stunden.
Timely arrived
Good job
Thanks.
But I havent seen the book yet as Im on travel..
great book great price.
Easy quick read a few good bits.
 
Not as expected
Dont order this this is not the book it says it is
This is the one I got with  pages less from an unknown author
I ordered for the book by Cleary Thomas and got a rubbish
I ordered a mass market one but got a hardcovered one with CD but the author and ISBN is not written anywhere.
A bit naff really
 Not what I expected at all
 I wouldnt recommend it.
Im sampling all the Kindle versions of the  Art of War to pick a readable translation
Like buses that all seem to come at once this is YET ANOTHER version of the Lionel Giles  version without the rather heavy original footnotes or the mildly useful Giles introduction
Its actually in quite readable English for the date and seems reasonably understandable in the st century
Ive no idea on the accuracy of the translation
Opening line from other Giles versions Sun Tzu said the art of war is of vital importance to the State
It is a matter of life and death a road either to safety or to ruin
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected
Prices vary considerably but the words stay the same
Update after clattering through all the Kindle samples this is the one I chose because its the cheapest AND I can always read the original introduction by getting a sample download from another version
Simples


It has very short description given
Very shortly wrapped up
I returned the book next day.
Awful....
Nonsense
This book is very much not motivational neither give you any means to enjoy
I really dont like this book.
if you read this you will change

must read for entrepenuers
Great book

The Journey to the West  is so wellknown a story in Chinese culture that I wont bother to review the story as such but will focus on the translation
 This book is the first volume of a fourvolume translation
 This review covers all four volumes
Any translation of a literary work let alone between languages as different as Chinese and English are is an exercise in compromise and cleverness
 A particular sentence in Chineseeven a single phrasecan be rendered in numerous ways in English each one of them carrying a different set of nuances
 To maintain narrative flow though the translator must choose just one of those ways which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader
 That is the compromise
 The cleverness comes in the insight and deftness with which the translator crafts and arranges those choices into a coherent whole
It is said that one should always translate into ones A languagethat is the language in which one is most fluent
 But Dr Anthony Yu was a native Chinese speaker and although years of teaching in the United States made him fluent in English it was still not his primary language
 It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this a story that he describes as near and dear to his heart that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped and yet reads as sprightly and as uproariously as though it were in fact the original
Something must be done with those nuances though
 Some translators choose to insert them directly into the body of the work as Howard Goldblatt does in his translation of Mo Yans Life and Death are Wearing Me Out
 But perhaps The Journey to the West is too full of Buddhist Daoist and other cultural allusions for them to be adequately captured in a passing sentence
 So Yus translation is copiously endnoted and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place
 Included also are scholarly citations that justify with a degree of rigor that will probably be overlooked by the average reader all the various word and phrasing choices he made
 In some cases Yus study has even found errors in the original text
The first volume of this translation adds an introduction that describes the textual history of this story Wu Chengens presumed authorship biographical sketches of the real people depicted in the novel and Wus motivations for writing it and them the way that he did
 These additions admirably fill out the narrative and setting delivered to us so seamlessly by Yu
 Other translations may have quainter charm or somewhat more fluid English but this one provides such a complete perspective on the novel that it presents itself immediately as the de facto standard
 A must have for the dedicated reader.
The Journey to the West is a lengthy th century novel regarded as one of the four great classics of Chinese literature
The author of the book is uncertain but is thought to be Wu Chengen
This volume contains the first twentyfive chapters of the hundredchapter narrative plus extensive notes and a ninetysixpage introduction by the translator Anthony C
Yu
I found the introduction a difficult read no doubt due to my prior ignorance about almost everything it covered
But the introduction was helpful and I am glad I labored through it
The book itself defied my expectations
It was neither dry nor dense nor inscrutable
To my surprise it appears to have been intended to be fun and despite the intervening centuries I often found it such
The narrative is a fantastical retelling of Xuanzangs pilgrimage to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures a pilgrimage that took place roughly a thousand years before The Journey to the West was written
In the retelling there are gods monsters dragons trickery humor and a plethora of epic fights
There is also a remarkably large amount of poetry serving both as description and commentary and the poetry lightened the reading
Since this volume contains only the first quarter of the story I will postpone further comments for now.
Journey to the West was my birthday present to my husband  and he loved it
He read a couple of pages to me and it put me to sleep
Reading the complete work is a labor of love for a scholarly person deeply interested in sixteenthcentury Chinese culture and its integration of Taoism Buddhism and Confucianism
The four hefty volumes offer a mythological and allegorical version of Xuanzangs journey to acquire scriptures in India
Ordeals along the way illustrate the stages of spiritual transformation
Xuanzang and his disciples are manifestations of the religious seeker
Dealing with the ordeals reads a bit like a detective story
Investigation reveals that the demons are often escapees from heaven
According to my husband who read every word of the four volumes including the footnotes the series is a fabulous exposition of Taoist internal alchemy and Chinese Buddhism.
Ive read Journey to the West Yus translation every few years for the last decade or so now
Its wonderful and improves with every reading
There are layers of meaning and I really appreciate Yus scholarly footnotes
Unfortunately the Kindle version is a bit of a mess
The Chinese characters are FAR too small to read theyre smaller than the smallestsize font and cant be resized
This is extremely frustrating since much of the wordplay and some of the important concepts hinge on the characters used
This needs to be fixed
Id say if you havent read Journey to the West read it
But stick with paper for the time being.
My yr old boy loves it Hes instantly hooked and enjoys sharing Sun Wukings adventures with me
I grew up reading it back in China but my son was born in the US and does not read Chinese Ive waited so long for him to appreciate Chinese classics Thanks to the translator and Amazon
I am only halfway through this book and I love it
 The story is so enticing that I dont want to put the book down
 The introduction was very boring but helped in better understanding of the story and should not be skipped
 Journey to the West is one of the top four books from China
 This book is worthy of every bit of the reputation I have heard
 My only regret is not having read this book earlier in life....as the saying goes...better late than never
Recommended reading.
I read the fourvolume revised Kindle edition of this book translated by Anthony C
Yu
The story is the fictive rendition of a journey made by a th century Buddhist monk Xuanzang during the Tang Dynasty
He undertook his famous nearly two decadelong pilgrimage in order to study Buddhism and acquire original Sanskrit texts of the religion from India
When he returned to China he translated many of the original texts to Chinese thus leaving a decisive legacy on Chinese Buddhism
Some of the pilgrims original scrolls are saved in a pagoda inside Xingijao Temple near todays Xian
The story starts with the mystical events of a creature becoming the Handsome Monkey King
Through various twists and turns he acquires great skills and a variety of supernatural power which he will continue to use throughout the book
Some mischievous acts in Heaven land him in trouble but upon the departure of Xuanzang  in the book also called the Tang Monk or Tripitaka after the Three Baskets of Buddhism that held the  original Buddhist scrolls  from the Emperors palace the Monkey King is given the opportunity to become the disciple and protector of the Monk
In the first phase of the long journey Tripitaka is granted two additional converted vicious monsters as his disciples Eight Rules who has the appearance of a pig and Sha Monk who has the look of a water buffalo
To complete the mystical traveling company a water monster is enforced to serve as the replacement of Tripitakas deceased horse
The bulk of the story is the description of the groups arduous traveling through impenetrable forests burning mountains and dangerous rushing rivers
They encounter countless demons spirits monsters dragons and fiends who invariably want to devour the guiltless Tripitaka
This enhanced interest in the Tang Monk as a culinary delight roots from his purity that is thought to guarantee extremely long life to the cannibalistic food connoisseurs
With his boundless ingenuity and smarts the Monkey King leads the three disciples to defend the Monk
For the contemporary reader the story has a few stumbling blocks not the least of which is the length of almost  pages
In the book one will find numerous repetitions where the four main heroes tend to recite some of their earlier adventures in various situations when they meet new characters
The reader is already fully aware of these events and they tend to slow down the flow of the story
One can skip these paragraphs however without losing much from the narration
For some readers another obstacle could be the numerous poems and songs throughout the book
In my rough estimation  of the text may well be poetry
The poems are enjoyable and usually provide finer details of or clarifications to the main story
As such they are more functionally part of the book then in another classic pillar of ancient Chinese literature the poetry in the Dreams of the Red Mansion
In that book the poems and songs are highly transcendent with the purpose of providing insight into the characters inner selves
I skimmed through many but not all poems
Others may decide to skip the poems altogether but those who decide to read them in even greater details will experience an enhanced overall literary beauty of the book
Of the four characters the Monkey King is by far the best portrayed one and the main reason I gave not  but  stars to this book
He is an absolute riot a perfect timeless embodiment of a bad guy turned good who has a curiously complex psyche with a mixture of selfadoration selfassuredness mischief steadfast loyalty courage wisdom practicality and on the top of everything a great sense of humor
Typical of him is the name he has chosen to himself early in the story The Great Sage Equal to Heaven
Among all the fictive characters I have encountered in my readings the Monkey King has become one of my all time favorites for his colorful and likeable temperament and for the exquisite perfection with which he has been portrayed
Although the Tang Monk is formally the leadhero of the story he really pales in comparision to the Monkey King
He is the most benevolent spiritually pure individual imaginable who is singularly driven by his unshakable convictions and principled Buddhist mind
Unfortunately he is also gullible to the point of annoyance and this brings a copious amount of trouble to the poor Monkey King
Eight Rules is a secondary character whose personality is also drawn with an expert pen
He is stupid yet quite capable in many ways
His loyalty to the Monk never feels solidified however he seems to function perfectly well under the critical tutelage of the Monkey King and the exculpation of the highminded Tripitaka
The character of the third disciple Sha Monk is far less complete than the previous three and doesnt deserve particular attention in this review
Overall the book in its full length is not an easy read
I recommend it mostly to those tickled by a potential glimpse into the spirituality of an ancient world namely the Tang Dynasty from the perspective of a much later but still very old time namely the late Ming Dynasty
What a rare privilege to enjoy such a treasure An abridged English translation is also available for those curious readers with a more tepid interest
Additional information The book has served as inspiration for multiple movies TV shows stage plays and comics
I saw one of these adaptations Alakazam the Great
This Japanese cartoon film although adorable in its own right in no way should be considered a faithful presentation of the original story
Ive also read the Ultimate Journey Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment by Richard Bernstein
The book adds a unique moderntime perspective to this ancient story.
We went to China this summer and visited the mountain where the monkey king has his office
Since we had never read the story we decided to purchase it
Its a long read so it is going to take us a while.
For anyone into Chinese culture and Eastern  spirituality
 This is a tale which I believe is nonfiction like everything else including the leprechaun where you can compare yourself to the main character Sun Wukong and evolve with it see yourself as a forever evolving leader
This monkey was not always godly but after learning lessons through pain you see the evolution of his character
This journey has many subcharacters too and I recommend you read this with patience and excitement both
Its a good laugh.
Very interesting story  The intro was as well a bit long and academic but educational
The book came in good condition smelled a little like cigarettes for some reason but basically brand new.
A great translation perfect for beginners just learning the story of the monkey king or for advanced students who want to study the text in more detail
This book helped me learn about the role Taoism and Buddhism in ancient Chinese culture and it gave me a familiarity with one of Chinas most beloved folk tales.
Having read Waleys abridged edition Monkey a good amount of these opening chapters were familiar
 Nonetheless Yus translation reads differently enough and the complete series of events is captivating enough that I had no desire to skip straight to Volume 
 I wish I had had the good sense to just read a complete translation the first time
 I even find Tripitaka ever so slightly less awful thanks to Yus introduction which offers some historical background
I thoroughly enjoyed the volume.
The book contains a lot of helpful footnotes explaining some of the lesser known cultural references
The story itself takes a lot of time to get going but if you can motivate yourself to keep reading you are treated to a journey equal to that of the oddysey even if Tripitaka is annoying to say the least.
I bought this for myself after watching some interesting videos about the journey to the west
I am super excited to read it and learn more
My only dislike so far is that the package came bent in a corner and caused a bend in the book corner too.
Always I had loved this stoy since childhood with its different incarnations on tv and movies and reading the actual story wrote in the  century is an Awesome experience
The introduction is a lil long but necessary to understand all the history and allegories that the story has as Daoism Buddhism  Confucianism
So isnt a children story as a lot of people used to see it..but a a TRUE literary work.
I fell in love with this story when i was a little kid watching the japanese tv show from the s called monkey
i love that show.
it is awesome
when i was in primary school i read an english abridged version of the journey to the west
it enjoyed it but i always wanted to read the full story
but i cant read chinese so i was never able to
until today when i found out that a full unabridged english translation of it had been completed and available to purchase this year  I bought all four volumes of this immediately on my kindle.
and I felt so great having the complete novel on my kindle ready for me to read at my leisure
 I wanted to write this review to thank Anthony Yu who i read spent  years translating this novel
 I am so thankful  Thank you Mr Yu And thank you Wu Chen En for writing this marvellous tale all those centuries ago.
This is a wonderful book especially meaningful to students of the Tao
 I havent finished it yet because I am savoring it
 I would highly recommend the book.
This is a very readable translation of the Chinese classic much better than a translation I attempted several years ago.
Not knowing Mandarin I cannot vouch for the accuracy but it seems complete
I am halfway through Volume 
I recommend for anyone trying to gain a background in Chinese literature along with Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Outlaws of the Marsh by Luo Guanzhong
All of the new Kindle versions are very good.
A comprehensive and entertaining take on a Chinese classic 
My son wanted this book
He has read it already and wants the next one
Maybe after Christmas.Super fast shipping.
Great edition of this classic book.
I have many translations of this Chinese classic as well as the original Chinese version
 If you want a real feel for this story you cannot go wrong with this version
 Yes it is long but so is the original
 If you are looking for a very condensed but well done version I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation
This is a quite stilted professors translation of a classic work of literature
I cant read the original but since this was popular writing in its day its hard to believe it is anything like this in the original
I discovered Arthur Waleys version published under the title Monkey after I bought this and I regret the purchase
I find it unreadable
The good doctor is to be commended for his exhausting effort to translate the entire work which Waley did not undertake
But Yu has merely a good students grasp of English and writing literary English is beyond his powers while Waley at his best has real gifts
Id recommend this translation only if you simply must have the entire work.
The best English translation ive ever found
This masterpiece contains a lot of meaningful cultivation practice principles
Totally worth reading.
I always get pulled in the beautiful world of this fairy tale legend
Highly recommended
Best book ever
Wonderful reading indeed
Never read a better book
Better than expected
Recommend to everyone who wants a good read.
Exciting vivid descriptive engaging story
Good read for fantasy and mythology fans
In some parts language is a bit archaic but overall very good
Just started Volume .
the critical introduction is what makes this issue valuable
Great
happy with product and service.
best book ever
not the easiest read
A masterpiece
I read this translation together with the Chinese original the authoritative Renmin Wenxue Chuban Se edition third edition released in 
My overall impression is that this translation is well done
Prof Yu strives to translate every single character so the minor flatteningout found in the Jenner version isnt found here
However at the highest level of criticism the translation lacks a little of the brio and fun found in Waleys highly abridged Monkey
Yus somewhat slavish adherence to the original text yields dividends yet at the same time sacrifices a bit of the verve
I found myself preferring to read the Chinese despite it being more difficult a feature of the somewhat abstruse vocabulary
Another point to note is that the original writer has a very wide vocabulary which isnt that noticeable in Yus translation he tends to tone down some of the more difficult words
Nonetheless Yus version must remain the best translation of Journey to the West though I wont say its definitive like Moss Roberts Three Kingdoms version for Sanguo Yanyi
What is really splendid about this edition is a lengthy and scholarly introduction which helps lay readers understand the Daoist and textual background of Xiyouji and Yus book may be recommendable for that alone.
Years ago I spent twoandahalf years reading this and the other three volumes of this novel aloud as a bed time story to a lover who had listed it as her next birthday present
At the end of close to  pages I said to myself Im never going to have to read another novel because nothing out there now will ever touch this work of art
After perhaps an year novel reading hiatus I picked up the habit again but still in light of The Journey to the West I really dont know if it is worth the time and money
Over time those volumes slipped away as onceread books tend to do and so I bought this and plan to buy the rest just to keep them close and occasionally read a chapter or two at bed time to my wife.
The book cannot be enjoyed without the reader having a basic exposure to Chinese culture and history.
great is it
awesome it is
cool it is
good it is very
great book it is very much
great job
i like super much
best book ive ever read.
Ive known about Journey to the west since I was a kid its deeply popular in asian culture
Ive seen  different tv shows about it
If I had read this book before watching those shows I wouldve thought Journey to the West was awful
The translation is extremely dry
I think it wouldve been better if the author took liberties and wrote the story himself rather than do a direct translation
If you are really interested in this story watch a subtitled version of the tv show
Theres not much to be had in these translated books.
I enjoy serious fairy tales Lord of the Rings Harry Potter etc
This is the Chinese version of the Hobbit as a prelude to Lord of the Rings
It is exceptionally sourced and crossreferenceda little tedious at times but impossible to put down through all  voumes.
Good book to read if you are visiting China I wanted a sense of literature from China it was perfect.
I would like to read this but  for a Kindle book any Kindle book is outrageous
The publishers are getting far too greedy.
I liked the look on my granddaughters face when she opened the package it said everything.
Reading Journey to the West is a fairly mammoth task
It is long Ive seen the statistic that it is twice the length of Tolstoys War and Peace
Be prepared to navigate your way through the tricky to translate metaphors in the poems characters who use a wide variety of names and a narrative structure unlike anything a present day Western reader is expecting
Also be prepared to discover endearing characters beautiful word use and a sense of humour and fun that defies time and cultural divides assisted by a very thorough accessible and beautifully written translation by Anthony Yu
When I wasnt too engrossed in the story the footnotes at the back provided an excellent explanation of what various turns or phrase refer to and lead me to learn so much about Chinese mythology and history
While I expected that it would be a long slog to get through the first volume I found Id read it very quickly
Now the only thing holding me back from continuing the journey is having to purchase the next volume As a PS someone who is starting to read should try keeping a Xuanzang falls off his horse count
He seems to do it quite frequently made me giggle every time...
Bought as a gift for my cousin lovely book
Really interesting cover.
Very good edition comprehensive and easy to read
A very big though not one to carry around with you.
A good introduction to the Chinese classics easy to read and enjoy yet amazingly deep as well
Well worth reading.
this book is so good Im definitely going to e getting volume 
Beautiful
This was probably the most difficult read of the year for me
Just getting through the introduction which is almost half the length of the book had me writing notes just to keep it clear
It requires a second read.
Obwohl die Einleitung etwas ermdend sein kann ist es doch hilfreich sich ohne Kenntnis der chinesischen Religionen durch sie zu kmpfen
Danach liesst sich das Buch wirklich toll
Eine packende Geschichte Gute Englischkenntnisse sind allerdings Voraussetzung  daher ein Punkt Abzug
Freue mich auf Band II.
If you like a bit of Monkey madness Arthur Waley translation and want to understand better the religion history and philosophy underlying the original Journey to the West and Chinese religion in general then this is the book for you
A really enjoyable translation with lots of footnotes for those interested
Oh and still plenty of laughs If the Chinese stare at you when you start laughing out loud just say XiYouJi and it will be laughs all round The kindle version was very easy to navigate.
Testo fondamentale della cultura e letteratura classica cinese del XVI secolo in una traduzione moderna puntuale scientifica poetica e leggibile
Molto divertente la cosmogonia cinese.
This whole series I mean all four volumes its just amazing
Beautiful poems wow and of course the stories
Its worth a read at least for me.
Great book a little bit too poectic at times but good overall
This is the second volume of Anthony C
Yus fourvolume translation of the Chinese classic The Journey to the West
As with the first volume it is quite different than Id originally anticipated
Far from being a dry difficult worthy tome it is filled with taunts trickery battles monsters and a generous helping of poetry
The narrative is episodic and repetitive but connections between the various events help thread it together
I had intended to read a chapter a day but was often tempted into more
Although there is a great deal of violence the tone is very light
Suffice it to say I didnt expect a Chinese classic to contain a scene where three of the heroes pass off their piss as holy water
A radical concept literature is allowed to be fun.
This is a classic series of stories that every child in China knows
 The characters are very popular
 I can now understand some comments made by Chinese speakers and TV news commentators that make allusions to this classic
 This is one of the four volumes translated by the author
 The books are heavily footnoted and suitable for serious study by English speaking persons interested in Chinese culture
 The main issue I have with the series of books is that there is a lot of repetitionbased on how the stories were told over the ages
 A minor issue is that many footnotes refer to other volumesbut the Kindle edition does not give an immediate link to the other volumes.
The good Some very funny stories especially one where our heros serve up some golden Elixir to some abusive Daoists
Almost made me tumble down the chair
Good veriety in settings
Lots of usefull footnotes to explain the more cryptic terms phrases to western readers
The Bad Deus ex machina resolutions Little to no character development
All Tripitaka does is cryliterally and complain which makes him really annoying
The demons are for the most part terribly singleminded.
While this continues to have some of the flaws of other ancient epics in particular the incidents are somewhat repetitious Yus translation is an easy and enjoyable read
 On to Volume .
A must read book for all avid readers around the world  Brought the whole series from this authors since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West
 It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me I read over  books in  yrs
 After reading JW Book  I wanted to read the other  JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book  of JW
 Amazing story telling
I have many translations of this Chinese classic as well as the original Chinese version
 If you want a real feel for this story you cannot go wrong with this version
 Yes it is long but so is the original
 If you are looking for a very condensed but well done version I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation
This is part two of one of the four great written masterpieces of China beautifully translated by Professor Yu
 It is I believe the closest English speakers will get to the original Chinese text
 Occasional awkwardness of wording in the translation is unavoidable as this work has gone from its original to a greatly contrasting culture
Do not let this discourage you as you read let it instead encourage you to learn to read the Chinese original
Seeing it via one of the many movies  TV productions available is a great help in enjoying this work
 I highly recommend the CCTV production from mainland China done in both  and .
Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book
 I recommend this and all the other volumes in this series by Mr
Yu to anyone interested in the culture history andor Tao  Well worth reading.
My grandson loves this book
Love it 
This translation of the classic novel respects every single detail like the poetry on it
CLASSIC
volume II what makes this worth the money is the references and context notes by the translator
One of the greatest stories ever written in the category of fantasy fiction
 Highly recommended.
A masterpiece
As expected
This translation of Journey to the West is awesome
 Ill admit that I havent read other translations but from people that I know that have read the Chinese version and also seen the Chinese series and I have discussed the book with them they say it is a great translation of the book.
This is a great story not just this volume I really recommend these books to be read by anyone it has everything that a great great story need
Prepare yourself for a great journey...read the story.
Great
happy with product and service.
A really great book I could hardly put it down
 The subtle comedy and the continuos action is perfect for anyone above  years old
 I LOVED it.
As a student of Chinese culture this book and other volumes is a must
As this is considered a very good translation of the original it took a while to find
But when I did well it did not disappoint
 Whether youre a student of Chinese culture a curious reader or even a Dragon Ball fan this book is a highly recommended read
Arrived quite fast and looks like its new too so thank you 
Very funny gives an insight to the traditions and culture of the time of writing the pace will keep readers on the edge of their seats
Highly recommend it.
This is the second entry in the  books and is equally interesting
Same as the first one some poems are just amazing and beautiful and lovely
And of course the story goes on.
The headline sums up my thougths
Very good book I like it very much it take some time to read I hope the translation ist ok.
Not to be a complete cornball but I knew I was dizzy with love for this th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown adding Be glad we havent naughty worded your dad
...ah I love learning about other cultures But really dizzying is the best word for this wonderful book
The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest the narrator shifts in and out of plotlines willynilly Who the heck is this person again I said way too often the Rongguo estate is described in extremely intimate detail there are poems on every other page and there is some protomagic realism going on the whole time with demons immortals and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life
Its all so...fascinating
It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I havent been in a long long long time
Just like with any love time for me to fess up there are some...issues
First of all this is just  of  volumes so it ends kinda abruptly and with  resolution
In fact there is almost never any resolution ever
Or a plot period to be honest
The story just saunters and putters around
Even the central love triangle between Daiyu Baochai and Baoyu hasnt really budged much so far and by the way Baoyu is an incorrigible little brat
It aggravates me how much I like him
But I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed all of this
My tip is to not fret so much about trying to figure out whats going on or how everyone relates to everyone
Once I just relaxed I surprised myself how invested I got in Baoyu Xifeng Grandmother Jia Aroma Tealeaf and all the big and petty goingons at the mansion
I can absolutely see why scholars dedicate their lives and livelihoods to Caos sprawling funny and heartbreaking work...
...I reckon Ill need a cigarette bad by the time Im finished with this whole thing.
What can I say about Story of the Stone that hasnt already been said It is truly one of the greatest masterpieces of world literature and I have spent nearly twenty years of my life reading and studying this incredible book in both English and Chinese
Having read both multiple times it should be said that David Hawkes translation of the first three volumes if exceptional
While I dont agree with every decision he made as a translator he always had a reasonable explanation Ive also seen his translators notes which is available in book form from the Chinese University of Hong Kong Press or available online for free
For example Im not sure about his changing of colors e.g
Dream of Golden Days instead of Dream of the Red Chamber but I understand why he did it and he makes a very good case for it
What makes this translation truly exceptional and the reason it is so much better than the English translation by Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang is because it can stand on its own as a work of literary art
Hawkes masterful prose makes the reader feel like the book was originally written in English despite the content letting you know that its a very different world because of how smooth and stylish it is
He is able to not only convey the words but the mood tone and feel of the book which is very hard to do especially with something so complex as Story of the Stone
He took some liberties with the translations of some of the poems of which there is a lot in this novel but they flowed naturally in English while still retaining by and large their original meaning and intent
Again that is not something easy to do not to mention his ability to handle nearly yearold Chinese humor and playfulness of word games and subtle foreshadowings
David Hawkes is clearly one of the most exceptional if not THE most exceptional translator of Chinese literature into English that I have ever encountered
His Introduction in Volume I is also one of the best overviews of the novel ever written
Of course the novel itself translation aside is sheer brilliance
Its vast scope ability to engender so many different and genuine feelings in the reader all of the ups and downs
It could be said that Cao Xueqin writes like a painter
His insane attention to detail and description makes the reader feel like they are really there standing in that elegant and opulent mansion or in Prospect Garden
It is said though that to truly start to understand The Story of the Stone you have to read it at least five times
I would also strongly suggest that those who fall in love with this novel as I have spend some time looking for other scholarly books and articles related to the novel because there are so many complex layers involved and you may even find a greater sense of closure particularly if you dont read the last two volumes which were a forgery not written by the original author of the first  chapters who had a quite different ending in mind.
This story in Volume one revolves around several upper class families and shows the high level of etiquette required among family members
 The English translation is seamless and becomes beautiful in the way poetic couplets of two or more lines are presented
One meaning of the book is that it is a remembrance of the past
This seems to refer to the lives of various princely families in Nangking during the early th century before they were punished by the Emperor
The Chinese author was a member of these families
The original in Chinese was printed in January of  and has become one of the most famous pieces of Chinese  literature
A knowledge of Chinese culture and history would no doubt increase the readers appreciation for the quality of this book.
Thisthe whole volume setremains Chinas greatest novel and possibly the greatest novel in any language
 It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China Red Studies from the more usual Chinese title of the book HUNG LOU MENG A Dream of Red Mansions
It really should be read by every educated person
  The other reviews on Amazon summarize the book well
 Some of them comment on the translations accuracy which I cannot do being too feeble in my Chinese to follow its difficult prose
 There are several things to add however
  Im currently reading it for the rd time I have also read the abridged translations with an eye to studying the ways emotion is represented for some work on emotions across cultures that I am involved in
 The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse elaborate and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader at least to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions
 There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese
 There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese incapable of individuality seen in most western accounts of crosscultural psychology
 In fact Caos characters are sometimes quirky sometimes downright eccentric and always individuals and characters
This is of course a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature
  The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do and identify Caos characters with people they know
Cultural psychologists take note
  First is the stunning level of social commentary here focused tightly and relentlessly on the plight of women in a traditional elite North Chinese household but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation
 Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women including being corrupted into notsogood women
  Cao was humorous and gently ironic
 The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Baoyu survives largely because of his infinitely caring sensible alwaysthere maid and lover Aroma
 Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses
  Nobody in the Englishlanguage literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement
 The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin
 Cao would probably have known their work
 They had the same socially critical stance
 They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women including women of the servant class
 If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic reflect American readers  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers you know they have servants yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff
 Cao is way ahead
  Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal intimate open writing about love that Cao managed so well
 There is a wonderful translation of one of Zhengs more painful and personal love poems in V
McHugh and C
Kwock WHY I LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN a booklet that should be more widely knownalas rare and obscure
  Moreover this humanistic attitudetoward women or just toward everybodyspread to Japan think of Rai Sanyo and Ryokan
 I doubt if they ever heard of Cao but they surely had read Yuan Mei and very likely had read Zheng and others
  There were a good number of women writers at the time
 Some were proteges of Yuan Mei
No one seems to know what happened to the women in Caos own personal life
  Chinese society in the early Qing Dynasty was horribly hierarchic and oppressive not least to women but the countercurrents represented by Cao and others were powerful and important
 They lie behind modern womens movements in East Asia.
For people that are accustomed to the cultures of the West Americas Europe it might be a chore to get interested in this book
The pace seems to be a little slow but that is because the details of daily life in China days past are different and they might just slip right past you
If youre interested in how life was lived in that part of the world this book will be a masterpiece as it has been in China itself.
One of the  classics of Chinese literature it is a riveting and interesting read Especially useful for someone who is keen to have a better understanding of Chinese culture and literature
Highly recommended.
One of the masterpieces of Chinese literature
 Five volumes and hundreds of characters
Has a modern feel despite being more than two hundred years old
Fascinating book.
Rank and privilege in th century China
The family compound
Relation between relatives and the pecking order
The state loses meaning at extended family level which tend to have their own laws and customs
Subjection of women is rife but not without protest
This book about customs is worth more than a history book in order to understand how people lived
 This is not a history book it is a novel of customs more about  what people thought about respect subservience and privilege  and mores.
Have not completed the book
Great introduction
Four stars just because the translation cant express the exact details and feelings from the original Chinese version.
This book is one of the celebrated classics in Chinese literature
The English translation here is very good
Even the poetry is well done
The book looks very agedold with yellow pages
Disappointed
The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me
Until I read Cao Xueqin I had no interest in China or chinese literature
These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the th century
I have spent the last year reading everything I can find from  and back and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books
I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman as his descriptions and details of the womens lives then is so incredible and knowing
In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences this is kind of unusual I think
Although the main character is a young male the books are primarily about the women the grandmother the aunts and cousins and the servants
There are millions of people in it it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place and often the stories of their lives are tragic
Full of intellectual games and poetry and religion the books have layers of reality and dream
Truth and fiction
There is double meanings in almost everything
I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer
And David HawkesJohn Minford are the cats meow for translators  I find Pinyon names much easier to read.
Excellent novel with great view of the Chinese culture of the time.
arrived no problem
A fascinating look at prerevolutionary China.
A Chinese classic well translated
Its a real pageturner
 As far as I can see its an episodic narrative without an overall structure but that didnt prevent me from thoroughly enjoying it
 Its hard to keep track of who the characters are  I read it on Kindle and only at the end did I see there was a key to the characters several pages long
 I suggest reading it in hard copy.
great
Ive read  our  translations of this classic novel and this is by far the best
Ive reread it about  times
Its like travelling in time and space for a vacation with extraordinarily interesting people of a different culture but Cao Xueqin describes their thoughts and motivations in such detail that one feels a part of their world
Its a great sprawling story by a master story teller.
Great novel great translation
...
I am not sure what to say about this book after reading only one volume
It is an exquisite blend of history fantasy magical realism reality riddle and of course Chinese philosophical witticisms
There are more than  characters in The Story of the Stone and many with very similar names
You must get familiar with at least  of these characters because they are not bit players
The plots are intricate but not particularly hard to follow and the pace of reading is quite brisk and easily understandable
That in itself is an accomplishment since the story takes place in China around  years ago and revolves around lifestyles and customs that I would imagine that most Westerners are unfamiliar with
I actually read a review where someone compared this book with Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann
I dont know about that but the overview of the book is that it is about the decline and fall of two families
It is a highly enjoyable book.
Wonderful Classic
Fantastic condition
The translator notes  the family tree diagram and the character listing with description are well worth it
 Other translations are incomprehensible.
I loved this classic novel
 There are extravagant descriptions of the unbelievably lavish lifestyles of those favored by the emperor and some very surprising episodes which strike one as daring for the ancient times depicted and thus modern although the values are conventional
This book is first of a five volume English translation of a Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber a.k.a
The Story of the Stone composed by Cao Xueqin
It generally considered as one of Chinas Four Great Classical Novels
It was written sometime in the middle of the th century during the Qing Dynasty and the setting of the story is early in the th century
This book was selected by Great Books KC group as our exposure to nonwestern literature for the year 
At the time Dream of the Red Chamber was selected for our schedule we didnt realize how long the complete work is
The Story of the Stone  the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by John Minford consists of five volumes and  pages of actual core text not including Prefaces Introductions and Appendices
Total page count is 
Our group decided to limit our discussion to the first volume as a more manageable reading assignment
I have no intention of completing the other four volumes any time in the foreseeable future
Its my understanding that the complete story is about the beginning grandeur and eventual decline of the aristocratic Jia family clan
As indicated by its title The Golden Days this first volume is focused on the beginning prosperous years
The book provides a detailed insight into wealthy Chinese cultural life of the time and the storys narrative includes frequent use of poetry
But this novel lays out a sprawling story line with numerous characters with names impossible for western readers to remember or pronounce
This is combined with excruciating details which at times can be beautiful but overall becomes a heavy forest of words for the reader to slog through
Frankly I didnt appreciate the experience very much
If I feel this way after the first volume I hate to imagine how I would feel should I manage to complete all five volumes.
David Hawkes English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far
Item arrived in reasonable condition.
I got the book within  hours
It was amazingly fast service
However perhaps it was too fast
The cover came torn and the back cover has a significant crease as it was bent back
Im not too far into the book but Im enjoying it so far
The dings that were caused in transit arent enough to upset me
Just something to be aware of when ordering.
I bought this book as a gift and the person likes the story very much I actually just bought her the first story but I hope she will get the following volumes too
I myself have enjoyed this book in the original Chinese edition and have loved it since I first read it
Highly recommend
It is a terrible translation

Only buy it if you must
A great novel the price is good too.
Read the whole series
 Great.
This particular version and translation of the novel is very enjoyable
I find it hard to understand since i bought this book for a college Asian literature class however it had gotten me interested in The Dream of the red chamber was well as many of the films Ive found
Futhermore the condition of the book i received was new and I was very happy about that.
This is an awesome book
 It is one of a famous trilogy that I happened upon while I was searching for Judge Dee mysteries
 It is magical marvelous and absorbing.
It is fantastic
As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a  understanding of the Chinese culture and history
I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel this one satisfies me quite well.
Not too much to say
Dream is amazing and Ill leave my commentary on the actual novel itself there
David Hawkes did a good job but his translation is lacking in many ways
Dream is full of puns and other languagecharacter specific nuances
Much of the deep irony and symbolism is lost in limp and at times flippant name translations and confusing reproductions of titles that can easily leave the reader scratching their head
His choice to translate from a combination of texts provides perhaps too many opportunities for translating to become editing and revision
Still a good buy if you have no investment in Dream as anything but a cool novel someone told you about but for those seeking a closer reading it would be best to at least have a Chinese version at hand for comparison.
The Story of the Stone is an absolutely delightful tale I only wish I could secure volume  since there is so much anticipation at the end of volume 
The translation is musical and the appearance of the book itself is lovely.
Havent finished it yet but so far no violence or sexual content.
This is a contemporary account of life in thcentury China
 The author is a very intelligent observer of daytoday life in that time
 As he goes through his daily routine he encounters eunuchs concubines slaves etc
which he accepts as facts of life
 The days when these manifestations of the human condition would be viewed with horror seem far away
 This book would be of great interest to students of history but might be a bit hard to stomach for others
 I only read the st of  volumes.
If you are going to buy this book make sure you get Vol
 as well
Or it would be better to buy another book that has the complete story

Let me first explicate a bit  perhaps add a disclaimer is more like it  about my approach to the book as contrasted with the other reviewers and my soso experience of reading it
 I am neither Chinese nor a Chinese scholar as most of the reviewers seem to be
 My only experiences with Chinese literature heretofore are Ezra Pounds translations of poets such as LiPo and other much older poets from the Tang Dynasty period
 Thus my approach to the book has consisted of that of a lover of Western literature dipping his toe into what all seem to regard as THE masterpiece of Asian literature
 Im sorry if my review disappoints or rankles the devotees of this book
 On the other hand it was my experience in reading this first volume and the review remains truthful to it
First I do concur that this volume was obviously a labour of love by English translator David Hawkes
 Indeed I actually found his Introduction much more interesting than the book as a whole
 He goes well out of his way in both the Introduction and the Appendix to make things as easy on the English reader as possible
 Nevertheless with  characters and according to both Hawkes and the Chinese reviewerstranslators here altogether too many puns and wordplay for the translator to convey them all he is rather swimming against the tide
 Also the turns of phrase and vocabulary employed by Hawkes are very British and quite archaic and whilst this was quite enjoyable to me being a native of England and a lover of its literature it does rather skew ones experience of reading it
 At times Baoyu and his feminine entourage come across as precocious flneurs or bright young things  a phrase Hawkes actually employs  of Interwar Oxonian vintage
Be all this as it may Cao Xueqin or whoever wrote the first chapter as this seems to be in scholarly dispute anticipates my reaction to the book in the form of the Stone in disquisition with Vanitas from which I quote in part I do not claim that they are better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time I am only saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more effective antidote to boredom and melancholy
On the other hand Mr
Stone Vanitas might have replied It may not prove so
 It certainly did not with me for various reasons
 It is not an unpleasant read
 Theres a sort of shimmering limpid quality to the characters and the setting
 There are even some pearls amidst the paste in the translated poetry such as In vain we roam Each in the end must call a strange land home
Or Heaped charnelbones none can identify Were golden boys and girls in days gone by
But to sum up what is missing in all the courtierlike atmosphere and sycophantic poetics in most of this book is any sort of tension or suspense or most of all any sort of inner life at all
 Several reviewers here mention Shakespeare in comparison to Xueqin
 I simply cant imagine any of the famous soliloquies occurring in the work or any intense focus on the inner travails of the individual which make him or her so much more important than the milieu in which she is situated
 Herein everything is milieu
 A pleasant interesting milieu granted but its still mere milieu
I am full willing to grant that I may be missing something due to translation or some idiosyncratic defect of my own but I simply cant see judging from this first volume how this work can be considered great literature.
At the age of  I was involuntarily compelled to read an abbreviated translation of this novel Dream of the Red Chamber
I remember how surprised I was to find that I enjoyed the experience
Life went on but I thought of the book many times and while recovering from surgery at the age of  it struck me that a reread might speed me back to health
How lucky I was to have stumbled on this fivevolume miracle of a translation which is just worlds and galaxies and universes richer than that first version Id readand a whole lot longer too
Ive laughed and cried and puzzled and wondered my way through it many times since over the intervening  years
Reading it is an immersive experience on so many levels and I am always amazed at how fully the author realizes his characters some of whom are capable of making me admire them on one page feel embarrassment for their foolishness on another suffer with them through their losses feel disgust at their insensitivity and even extreme cruelty and yet still love them as human beings whose motivations Ive come to understand intimately
Only a very few of the worlds greatest authors can render their characters in such glorious complexity and for my money Cao Xueqin is one of them
The author is as charismatic as they come
If youre not yet a fan of Buddhist poetry you soon will be
If youre not yet into elaborate descriptions of Chinese aristocratic customs and manners now your conversion is coming
If you think that tales of doomed teenage love are too sappy to bear youre going to drop that prejudice somewhere toward the end of Volume 
And if you think its silly to cry buckets at the end of a novel let Cao tell you why youre wrong When grief for fictions idle words More real than human life appears Remember life itselfs a dream And do not mock the readers tears
See The paperback copies I bought back in  have been read many times and are still in decent shape
Whats not in decent shape is my eyesight which is why my last couple of readings of the stone have been on Kindle
I hope to read it at least a few more times while I inhabit this incarnation.
This review applies to the first three volumes of this story
This is a typical Chinese fable  involving hundreds of characters
It follows the growth and interactions of a large well to do family and its branches
This in itself makes it difficult to keep track of each one but it is made even more difficult because each character is referred to by more than one name
Their given name their relationship name  Auntie Xue.
and their nickname
Aside from that the storyline is rather mundane and does not move along at a satisfying pace
But the biggest complaint is the translation I have read other Chinese fables and have found them a satisfying read however this translator seems to have written his own tale
And it is done more as an English Victorian tale in words and phrases rather than a Chinese fable.And in his lengthy introductions he admits he has taken liberties with the earlier manuscripts and translations
His language is not at all reminiscent of other Chinese translations in use of words or idioms 
While there are more volumes left to read I will not go beyond the first .
This book is probably the best translation from Chinese into English
The choice of archaic English words and phrases preserves the tone and style of the original Classical Chinese texts
Even the poems when translated into English are rhythmic
The translator has a profound knowledge of Chinese culture history and Buddhism
The story setting complexity entangled relationship among people subtle feelings within characters are stunningly preserved
The main character Baoyu and Daiyu jumps out in front of you
This magical novel portrays a traditional society turned upside down a boy whod rather be a girl women who are more powerful than men and a faerie who delivers the most licentious of messages
Much of this panorama takes place within the tranquil gardens and handcarved edifices of the Jia family mansions where life is constantly in flux
Cao Xueqin calls this The Land of Illusion an ethereal contrast to the realm of the soul where realitys as hard as rock but stones can talk the authors interesting philosophy is presented with admirable wit and humility too
Ontologically speaking souls of all kinds travel between two realms that mirror each other on an elusive search for bliss
Truth becomes fiction when the fictions true Real becomes notreal where the unreals real the novelist writes only to lament The disillusioned to their convents flyThe still deluded miserably die
Life for the Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family is painful chaotic and scandalous
Yet sophisticated readers will marvel at Caos expressive art and soaring lyricismand David Hawkess English translation is superb in its life and immediacy
The protagonist Baoyus object of desire the fragile and elusive Daiyu is quite literally a Crimson Pearl Flower incarnate and the volatile relationship between them is beautifully rendered
Born with a shimmering piece of jade in his mouth Baoyu shares her mystical origins to be certain but sensing their bond he struggles all the more for it
What is the essence of her he seems to ask and what is the essense of me When in a moment of levity some feminine beauties ask him wherein lies your preciousness and wherein lies your hardness the question wryly ambiguous Baoyu concludes with innocence No real Botree the body isThe mind no mirror bright.On what could dust alight A Western reader might quarrel with his answer but in Cao Xueqins masterful hands reality is a lump of jade we can kicka realm where moments of truth will fade to laughter and celebration
My Titles     
I spend a lot of time wandering through bookstores
 One particular book has caught my eye over the years and the other day I bought it  Volume  of Cao Xueqins eighteenth century epic The Story of the Stone  The Golden Days
 As a developing eighteenth century scholar I was doubly attracted to it
 The Golden Days absolutely blew me away  used as I am to eighteenth century novels British French American this is wholly unlike anything Ive read from the era
 It bears structural similarities to the Laurence Sternes Tristram Shandy and Sentimental Journey but aside from that bears more in common with ancient Greek novels like Longuss Daphnis and Chloe or Heliodoruss Eithopian Romance as well as the mysticism of the ancient Egyptian Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor
 And yet Caos attention to actual life experiences and the detail he conveys about tradition and ceremony along with frank dealings with human relationships and sexuality makes The Golden Days much more than any quick summary of style or content can relate
The Golden Days begins in amusing but sympathetic fashion  the goddess Nwa is repairing the sky with  stones
 When she finishes one remains which is cast off
 Having been touched by a goddess this stone has magical properties able to move change size and even talk
 One day a Buddhist monk and a Taoist come upon the stone and promise to let the stone have an adventure  to become human
 As the stone waits by a pond it falls desperately in love with a Crimson Pearl Flower which is also selected for incarnation by the Fairy Disenchantment
 The stone and the flower are incarnated as the novel begins in earnest as a young minor nobleman named Jia Baoyu and a commoner related to the family a girl named Lin Daiyu  both unaware of their heavenly origins
 The Golden Days centers around the daily events and occurrences in the lives of these two teenagers as they come to grips as we all must with human life
The Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family on opposite sides of Two Dukes Street are the centerpieces of the novels action
 Like the big house fiction of the English eighteenth century these ancestral manses provide a locus of activity as the nobles their extended families friends and servants mingle and interact constantly
 Cao marks himself as a remarkable author by the way he handles a massive cast of characters letting us into the private lives and concerns of all ranks of society as well as the forms of etiquette that determine their relationships
 Another terrific facet of the novels construction is the almost stream of consciousness style Cao employs  as characters pass in and out of the immediate action of the novel the narrative seems to choose the person its most interested in and follow them for pages at a time before seamlessly passing to the next character
 Its really quite amazing how in this way we come to understand the motivations fears and hopes of so many individuals
 Time distance culture Cao levels distinctions making historical China accessible to even st century readers  he reduces people to their human concerns
Cao Xueqins novel is also remarkable for what I can only call its protofeminist tone
 While we are reminded by certain characters that male lineage is of major importance to the structure of the society the narrative consistently shows the power ability and influence of women
 At the novels beginning a Taoist named Vanitas finds the stone and is asked to transcribe its story but complains initially that it is about a number of females
 The stone obviously insists that the story be written out
 Later Baoyu the major male character says he is more comfortable around women  that they are like water while men are like mud castoffs unclean
 One of the main characters of this volume is Wang Xifeng a young woman in her early twenties who for an extended period manages the affairs of both the Ning and Rong mansions
 Caos respect and admiration for the strong women in Baoyus life  Xifeng Daiyu and two particular servants Aroma and Caltrop is quite obvious and important to the novel
If you are like me and know tragically little about Chinese literature and culture Cao takes care of that too  there is a heavy emphasis throughout the novel on the cultural productions of China
 The book integrates a wide range of poetry drama fiction folk wisdom and mythology as a central part of Baoyu and Daiyus upbringing
 One can sense Caos insistence in the novel that education and cultural production is of vital importance particularly to children
 While the Fairy Disenchantment seems to be the guiding spirit of the novel hinting at the diappointments inevitable in the course of life this is a novel about youth and hope for the future even in the midst of concern about how long prosperity can last
 Taken altogether The Golden Days cannot be recommended enough
 David Hawkess translation is first rate and his introduction pronunciation notes and appendices are thorough and very helpful.
Written in  The Story of the Stone is an impressive and fascinating tale that incorporates otherworldly magic and mysticism with the saga of wealthy Jia family
 The fivevolume story chronicles the familys highliving glory days through their bitter decline all the while immersing the reader in rich details of daily life in th century China
 I completely agree with the following quote from the Times Higher Educational Supplement an astonishing book
 It recreates a world that would otherwise be utterly lost
 Anyone even mildly interested in Chinese history and culture will be enthralled by this glimpse into the privileged world of wealthy th century Chinese
Author Cao Xueqin was truly a creative genius  Story of the Stone is multifaceted multidimensional and superbly crafted
While reading the first chapter of the first book Dream of the Red Chamber I was struck with how utterly clever and imaginative the story is
 You will instantly be aware that you are reading something that has endured almost three hundred years for a very good reason
 The story is populated with dozens of wonderfully threedimensional characters  many of whom are woven in and out of the story making for a most interesting read
 Most notable is the spoiled and curiously effeminate protagonist Jia Baoyu who possesses a special magical item that I wont reveal here dont want to spoil your enjoyment of the book
All of the elements that make traditional Chinese literature such a joy to read are embodied in Story of the Stone
 Elaborate settings delicate verse and traditional symbolism with a healthy dose of humor and bawdiness create a beautiful and riveting story that will keep you wanting more
 I highly recommend reading the entire book series
 It is impressive that a work can stand the test of time as well as Story of the Stone has
David Hawkes fine translation is excellent
 Although some have criticized him for using too much slang I feel that his translation is effective in expressing the characters true sentiments and it is tremendously easy to read
 Story of the Stone is an unforgettable and awesome read that I highly recommend.
Well in my opinion anyway
David Hawkes has done an amazing job translating this brilliant thcentury novel into colloquial modern English
I have read all the translations this is my favorite novel and this is by far the best version for an English speaker who just wants a good book
I can imagine that a Chinese reader could pick holes in this translation as I could nitpick at a translation of Shakespeare the wealth of the original is impossible to transfer whole into another language and culture
If you want a wordforword translation so you can use this as a study guide while you read the Chinese maybe the wooden Beijing Languages version could help you But I have a hard time imagining any new translation being more vivid and fun to read than this one
Yes it is littered with sometimes annoying Britishisms
That is the price of a colloquial translation Its true that Hawkes does not explain all the references that would be another book in itself
 And I am sure he made mistakes I help a French translator occasionally and even though he is very wellversed in English it is so easy for him to miss something that only a cultured native speaker could pick up
But this translation is ALIVE
Until that perfect translation comes along one day Hawkess is still better than all the others
Be grateful to him 
The Dream of the Red Chamber The Story of the Stone starts off as an immensely long inscription on a miraculous stone which was copied out by a visiting man and taken down into the world for publication
Volume  gives the account of the magic stones origin renders the discourse redolent of a supernatural mystical overtone
Once upon a time a piece of stone that was unworthy to be used for repairing the sky possessed magic power and ended up in the mortal world
The unhappy stone incarnated and lived out the life of a man before finally attaining nirvana and returning to what Buddhist refers as the other shore
Jai Baoyu is the incarnation of the stone
The name baoyu means treasured jewel and was named after the wonderful incident that the only surviving son of the Jia household was born with a piece of spotless jade in his mouth
Lin Daiyu Baoyus teary cousin with a superior intelligence is the incarnation of the Crimson Pearl Flower which the unhappy stone once conceived a fancy that he took to watering everyday so the flower was able to shed the form of a plant and became a girl
The consciousness that she owed the stone ensued her to repay him with the tears shed during the whole of a mortal lifetime if they were ever to be reborn as humans in the world beneath
It was no wonder when Daiyu first saw her cousin who had tyrannized the household hated studies and spent most of his time in womens quarters it was as though she had seen him somewhere before like a dj vu
Aside from the ethereal origin the first volume of The Dream of the Red Chamber depicts a fairly eventual record of a great Manchu household Qing Dynasty under the tutelage of the Imperial family in early th century China
Its the picture of daily routines in the life that emerge most vividly from its discourse
The Jia household is genuinely disguised as some highborn aristocrats whose ancestors were ennobled for their military powers
This first installment of five parts titled Golden Days captures the Jias at the hitime in which members of the Rongguo mansion and the Ningguo mansion dressed in silk ate delicately pampered by a domestic hierarchy of servants and maids when they were still nested in the protecting shadow of the ancestors and the readily accessible wealth
The familys decline and fall constitute the general background of the novel
With over  characters thousands of onehit appearances and a skein of household members and their distant relations of the clan reading of The Dream of the Red Chamber will be more pleasurable and rewarding with the family genealogy handy
The book has a general flow of daily happenings and interfamily drama with an emphasis on the relationship between Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu
Household activities domestic anecdotes subbing rivalries seditious schemes love affairs contention between concubines political intrigues black magic witchcraft and even murder constitute to the pages of this Chinese epic that evokes Remembrance of Things Past and One Hundred Years of Solitude
The heart of the novel is the predestined relationship between a semiethereal entity and magic stone under the context of the Buddhist understanding that earthly existence is an illusion
This meeting though is meant to be is in vain one that is full of tears
When the fairy led Baoyu into the land of illusion and showed him his fate he could scarcely make out of what he saw
Nature might have endowed him an eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton
How does one expect a yearold scholars deem him to be  throughout most of the book to recognize and seize his destiny The fairy showed him not only his life cycle but also the romantic passions love debts heartbreaks of duststained human world
Baoyu was destined to mingle with girls around him
The ancestors thought Baoyu had inherited a perverse intractable nature that rendered him eccentric and emotionally unstable
Exposure to the worldly illusions of decay might hopefully succeed in enlightening awakening and transforming him
Daiyu seems to know Baoyu more thoroughly than anyone does
She is able to nail his problem despite her occasional tiff with him over trivial matters
Baoyu always complained about peoples getting angry with whatever he did but he never realized how much he had provoked them at the first place
Couplets poems and verses in the novel hint at his friendlessness in the mortal world and the incessant debate over the depth of his relation with Daiyu
The roaming back and forth sink and soar between sorrow and elation between the two incarnated cousins constitute to the understanding that earthly existence is indeed a transience but karma determines the shape of ones life and the life after
This idea of life being a dream from which one eventually awakes is a Buddhist tenet but the incorporation of it into the novel becomes a poetic gesture to demonstrate that the main character Baoyu is indicative to the author
The Dream of the Red Chamber in Chinese has the connotation of being rich and grand
The title can refer to a dream of the vanished splendor and opulence
The frequent use of dream imagery implies the possibility that the luxurious world of the authors youth which he attempted to reconstruct had vanished so utterly at the time of writing
The story of the Jias closely accorded with fortunes of Caos own family which attained its height under the reign of Kangxi
But the exact relationship existing between characters of the novel and members of Cao family is uncertain and discreet
Baoyu is assured to be authors selfportrait whose struggle towards emotional maturity was delineated with an affluence of nuance
Other characters could be compsite of several family members over different generations for the purpose of disguising facts.
Im surprised that I had never heard of this novel until recently
Covering five volumes and over  pages it was written in the eighteenth century and depicts the life of the aristocracy in ancient China
 The first volume introduces us to many characters and its tough getting them all sorted out mostly due to names that are quite foreign to Western readers
 However the narrative is so natural and flows so easily I found it quite easy to submerge myself in the story
 Perhaps the translation is to be credited because although the tale is set over  years ago I never felt as though the characters were anything but recognizably human
 I intend to read the remaining four volumes
 Quite absorbing and unique.
I just finished a class devoted to the study of The Story of the Stone aka Honglou Meng Dream of the Red Chamber and feel completely awed by the complexity and skill of Cao Xueqin
This novel thoughtfully and naturally weaves together several timeless human themes
If you enjoy literature which requires analysis at several different levels simultaneously youll love this book
Two notes for those who dont speak Chinese Learning the characters names is difficult even for those with a background in Chinese but the translator does do readers a favor by translating servants names into English equivalentsapproximations while leaving the names of the main family members in romanized Chinese
Keep in mind that two of the most important families are named Jia and Zhen which mean false phony artificial and true real genuine respectively
This is just one of many iinteresting and meaningful messages inevitably lost in translation Also in my opinion the first three volumes written by Cao are much better than the last two volumes written by Gao E
Still its interesting to compare the ways Gao changes the story.
I love the Story of the Stone and overall I enjoyed this translation in fact I read all five volumes
The only things I didnt like was the use of modern english slang in some areas and the poetry translations
Otherwise the set is a marvelous translation of a great classic
The Story of the Stone is a novel that should be included in any true curriculum of the great books
There are sequences that are emotionally moving and powerful
This is the most complete translation in English I am aware of.
This is the first volume of a  volume series and does not stand alone
If you read it and enjoy it be prepared to read the other four volumes
The story is difficult to begin with not for lack of interest but because of the complexity of Chinese names for the western reader
The book is  provided with a useful list of characters for each volume and after  referring to this during the first half of the first volume all becomes  clearer for the remainder of the book
The story itself is a fascinating  picture of life in th century China and portrays the development of a  young boy who has otherworldly origins
The western reader needs to view  dispassionately the Buddhist theme which pervades the novel but when read  with an open mind the philosophy underlying the novel is both charming and  practical in its own way
I found the book addictive though it has to  be said that others of my acquaintance found it too difficult to cope with  and abandoned the story before the end of the first volume
If you  persevere it forms a wonderful introduction to classical Chinese  literature and those similarly addicted will find it leads into many other  books of Chinese prose and poetry.
The reader will be disappointed if he is expecting lots of thrills and twists and turns
This is not that kind of book
Rather Story provides an engaging peek into the lives of an upperclass family in feudal China
The story takes a little patience at the beginning due to the large number of characters
But the reader will soon realise that how the characters are related to one another is not crucial to appreciating the book
Rather each character has its own personality strengths and weaknesses and comes alive in its own right
I believe that the reader will like me come to feel for the characters in no time and look forward to finding out how their lives evolved in the later four volumes
David Hawkes translation cannot be faulted
The writing flows easily and the flavour of the allegories and poetry are to a large extent retained.
 A NonChinese reader should beware of the fact that no matter how good Dream of Red Chamber is translated into English the gap between English  Chinese original is still huge for several reasons 
The language Cao used is not the Mandarin that Chinese are using today they were more subtle superb to the degree that author is capable to densify and enliven a whole paragraph in English into several sentences
I will take some examples later..

Cao was born from a noble family he was well trained in Ancient Chinese Philology Prosody Rhetoric thus the gamut of knowledge and references cause huge problems not only for Western Scholars which are very few but also Eastern StoneScholars

The vissicitude of Caos family is unimaginable to a modern reader the richness of language emotion and situation in which the author wrote this book render more subtlety than modern readers can fathom and writers alike to apply

Too many puns quibbles word plays and moods of Chinese poetry are heavily distorted by both English and translator and the names Cao gave to the characters always imply something Jia BaoYu implies precious jade Lin DaiYu  had several meanings it can be used to describe a beauty green color or the the material women used to draw eyebrows of course its an extremely feminine Chinese character for women
Xue BaoChai implies precious hairpin Etc...
I am distraught by the fact that the translator never mentioned on this
 I will take one paragraph from Chapter  in Volume II if you dont understand Chinese you can compare the length of them
                                                 Nightingale and Snowgoose had long since become habituated to Dai yus moody temperament they were used to her unaccountable fits of depression when she would sit the picture of misery in gloomy silence broken only by an occasional gusty sigh and to her mysterious perpetual weeping that was occasioned by no observable cause
At first they had tried to reason with her or imagining that she must be grieving for her parents or that she was feeling homesick or had been upset by some unkindness they would do their best to comfort her
But as the months lengthened into years and she still continued exactly the same as before they gradually became accustomed and no longer sought reasons for her behaviour
That was why they ignored her on this occasion and left her alone to her misery remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves with their own affairs
She sat motionless as a statue leaning against the back of the bed her hands clasped about her knees her eyes full of tears
It had already been dark for some hours when she finally lay down to sleep
Our story passes over the rest of that night in silence
Next day was the twenty sixth of the fourth month the day on which this year the festival of Grain in Ear was due to fall
To be precise the festivals official commencement was on the twenty sixth day of the fourth month at two oclock in the afternoon
It has been the custom from time immemorial to make offerings to the flower fairies on this day
For Grain in Ear marks the beginning of summer it is about this time that the blossom begins to fall and tradition has it that the flower spirits their work now completed go away on this day and do not return until the following year
The offerings are therefore thought of as a sort of farewell party for the flowers
This charming custom of speeding the fairies is a special favourite with the fair sex and in Prospect Garden all the girls were up betimes on this day making little coaches and palanquins out of willow twigs and flowers and little banners and pennants from scraps of brocade and any other pretty material they could find which they fastened with threads of coloured silk to the tops of flowering trees and shrubs
Soon every plant and tree was decorated and the whole garden had become a shimmering sea of nodding blossoms and fluttering coloured streamers
Moving about in the midst of it all the girls in their brilliant summer dresses beside which the most vivid hues of plant and plumage became faint with envy added the final touch of brightness to a scene of indescribable gaiety and colour
 Thus for those who think this book is greatly written you are right but the original one is incomparably more gorgeous.
I think the most important quality of this piece of literature that qualifies it among the alltime classics is the layering of progressive ideas within traditional Chinese philosophy and structure
The oppression censorship required Cao Xueqin to disguise all relatively innovative and rebellious themes under apparent themes of acceptance the current political and cultural status quo
The strict censorship also explains why the final editors toned down the material before publishing the novel and the last  volumes fail to remain faithful to the true gold of the first  volumes
 All good literature questions society and the individual a skill in which Cao Xueqin proves to master
I highly recomend this book to any patient readers
If you struggle with deciphering the complex web of Chinese philosophy I also recommend reading Andrew Plaks Archetype and Allegory in Dream of the Red Chamber.
This book was fascination not only for the cultural review of s in Manchu Qing Dynasty China and aristocratic households of the day but also for the introspective look at family dynamics and confucian practices in the time
 With the tragicromantic form of writing one feels a longing to understand how different life was in those times and places
 I also got a great feel for what the writers intent was and the criticisms of political changes through the translaters appendixi and annotations
 Great reading for thinkers
I put it down after about  pages just better things to do with my time
Boring
I found it hard going when I started to read it
Perhaps it would suit someone more able than me
Perhaps given more time I will try again.
I wouldnt call this an exciting story however it is fascinating to see into the way of life of the very rich.
Following on from Michael Woods BBC series on the history of China I bought several books including this one
I am enjoying reading it and will continue with the next book in the series when I have finished this first novel in the series.
Excellent translation
 Fascinating.
enjoyable funny insight into a world that nolonger exists  but every character recognizable in their flaws and failings and all the more loveable for that fact
Perfect present
Brilliant.
Good read
I thought Id sample some Oriental literature and decided to dive into this epic family saga
Having read this first volume and the second volume I am very happy with my purchase
It is tough to familiarise yourself with all the different characters in the book but very soon you realise that the abundance of people within this one family household is one of the delights of the story
Theres always something going on be it the concerns of the aged Grandmother Jia the loveable oddities of Bao Yu or the frettings of the vast array of maids
Dont expect anything dramatic to happen every twenty pages otherwise youll be disappointed
This novel moves very slowly
But it is meant to be realistic and this again is part of the charm
Through reading its pages you learn a lot about Chinese culture of that time and this is exciting in its own way
I read the first volume and fell in love with the characters so much that I could not conceive of not carrying on with the remaining four volumes
I think that is a testament to how good the book is and indeed the translation.
As I was pondering what to read next I realized that this piece of work which runs to nearly  pages double the size of War and Peace will be a perfect foil for the long evenings during the Covid lockdown period
I started reading in earnest on May  and finished it on May 
The th century saga which is believed to be based on the authors own life and intended as a memorial to the twelve Nanjing women that he knew in his youth maps the rise and fall of two closelyrelated noble families
The characters profligate by nature waste away the immense ancestral wealth in frivolous activities and often times find themselves on the wrong side of the law
Imperial authorities confiscate the family properties once their misdeeds come to light
After much tragedy the family is eventually restored to its former position by the Emperor
And inbetween all this fateful happenings the great passions and follies plays out in full flow which in a contrasting manner are set against the backdrop of the Karmic Law that lays emphasis on the intemperance of life on earth
Overall the book is full of details relating to the social cultural and spiritual life of the time
The Penguin translation was titled The Story of the Stone based on the novels frame story in which a sentient heavenly stone is sent to earth to live out the drama of human passion one of the main characters Jia Bao Yu is born with a jade in his mouth thereby suggesting that he was the sentient stone sent to earth by two enigmatic Taoist and Buddhist priests
I still wish the Penguin had gone with the title Dream of the Red Chamber instead of The Story of the Stone
I think the title Dream conveys a better sense of the underlying theme than the Stone
The novel has some spectacular supernatural elements
Volume  has some good dose of the supernatural but in sharp contrast Volume  is completely devoid of it
Volume  has one or two sequences
It picks up pace in Volume  and reaches the zenith in Volume 
The dreams nightmares premonitions seances and apparitions can spook anybody and borders on the horror genre
However all the sequences are so beautifully blended into the narrative in such a way that they dont feel out of place
Somehow all those supernatural elements feel real like how one would feel the happenings in a dream as real
That is the big success of this novel
When the going is good none of the characters pay heed to any of the superstitions but as their fortunes begin to dwindle you can observe that one by one slowly falling prey to many superstitious practices
This is a great insight into peoples psychology of clinging on to a sense of certainty and security as the world around them crumbles
None of the characters can either be classified as good or bad in binary terms
Each one has their good side as well as the bad side
Perhaps this is the great strength of the novel as it lays emphasis on the shades of grey when it comes to judging a persons actions
Often times you can justify a characters actions from his or her point of view but cannot be justified from the others persons perspective
One can spend a lifetime researching this novel
Dont hesitate to enter the dream world created by the good old Cao Xueqin.
Tremendous achievement on David Hawkes part
Very good this is available on Amazon Kindle.
Es uno de los mejores libros que he ledo
Tengo los cinco volmenes en tapa blanda y me lo comprara para kindle si no fuera porque el vol.III no est en ese formato Por qu cuatro volmenes si y uno no Por fin el vol.III Gracias
The book is fantastic and pretty interesting however the book did not arrive in excellent conditions.
hier ein paar Attribute zum Buch  gutes Englisch erforderlich  enormer Umfang  berraschend mystisch  insgesamt Genre schwer einzuordnen
Slow start and must be confusing for the Western reader who are not familiar with Chinese culture
 Lots of names and interrelationship between the characters to get to grip with
Book    is all about the good life...
lots of eating partying and generally having a good time
 The translation is good and I think its a great idea to leave main characters names as it is pronounced in Chinese but the maids etc are translated into easy to remember English names
 Overall enjoying the read and cant wait to go through the whole  volume to find out what happen.
la roman a une trs belle couverture avec la culture chinoise forte et attractive
 cest la meilleure version anglaise que jai jamais savoir non seulement pour les lecteurs occidentaux mais pour les lecteurs chinois aussi.
Sehr interessant und auch berraschend kurzweilig wird das Alltagsleben einer groen chinesischen Adelsfamilie beschrieben
Der Band ist mit The Golden Days untertitelt und diesen Eindruck hat man beim Lesen auch Der berfluss und die Dekadenz die Ritualfixierung des Alltagslebens und der stndige Ennui bei gleichzeitiger dauernder Unruhe dieser privilegierten Schicht wird sehr plastisch geschildert
Diese Kapitel des Romans wirken unbeschwert und leicht vom spteren Niedergang ist noch nichts sprbar
Der Leser der moderne Romane gewohnt ist wird sich auf ein paar Eigenheiten der klassischen chinesischen Romane einstellen mssen
Auch wenn das vorliegende Werk das Erbe der mndlichen Weitergabe schon deutlich hinter sich lsst sind immer noch typische Merkmale wie die Einleitungsgedichte die Kapitelschlussformulierung und die in Gedichtform eingestreuten Umgebungsbeschreibungen vorhanden
Auch der fr chinesische Romane typische berfluss an Personen kann etwas einschchternd wirken gerade zu Beginn die ersten  Kapitel sind nicht leicht zu lesen danach wird es deutlich besser verstndlich wenn die wichtigsten Figuren eingefhrt sind
Man darf natrlich bei diesem Werk auch keine sprachliche Ausgefeiltheit wie bei Mann oder eine Charakterisierung wie bei Dostojewskij erwarten dazu ist die Gattung bei diesem Roman noch nicht weit fortgeschritten genug
Trotzdem bietet sich dem Leser ein Familiendrama das einen schnell in seinen Bann zieht
Der hier vorliegende Band  enthlt die Kapitel  bis  von  man muss sich also auch die anderen  Bnde zulegen um die Geschichte ganz zu lesen
Eine gelungene Einfhrung und uerst hilfreiche Familienstammbume runden das Werk ab
Die bersetzung von David Hawkes ist sehr gelungen und hat neben einigen leseerleichternden Kunstkniffen Namensbersetzung von Nebenpersonen auch einen sehr angenehmen Fluss zu bieten in dem weder die homosexuellen Anspielungen noch die teilweise deftige Sprache untergehen
Wem dieses Werk gefllt kann sich auch Die Gelehrten Rulin Waishi The Scholars ansehen da sowohl Thematik als auch Stil recht hnlich sind.
I have long sought to start reading this six volume story  a classical Chinese story and I find a reasonably priced copy in USA  order it  Lo It is delivered efficiently  good deal
Great.
I was rather taken in by other reviews
 This book is very difficult to get into and the extensive preamble really intended for more scholarly minds than mine is very offputting
 I have put the book away for the time being  probably a better read on cold winter nights
In spite of enthusiastic reviews most Westerners will find this hard going although it does illustrate the weird formalistic and ritualistic lifestyle and etiquette of highup Chinese in the th century when coming up with the right poem at the right time seemed to be the key to advancement
Good as an insight into this strange lifestyle but repetitive
Could nt face another four volumes
good
The book arrived on time and in a pristine condition as described
Thank you very much.
Anthony Yu grew up hearing the tales of Monkey
 While with the University of Chicago he decided to translate this masterpiece preserving the verse and as well as the prose sections of this classic work
 One of the great pieces of Chinese literature along with Dreams of Red Mansions Three Kingdoms Outlaws of the Marsh etc.
 The verse will be stiff at times Chinese verse into English is always a challenge while references will easily escape a Western audience it is still enjoyable for the many adventures philosophical leanings and even comedic elements that give this classic a timeless feel
 For all its flaws there really is no better translation into English.
The funny stories present in the first two volumes are almost nowhere to be found in this one there is one
Moreover several of the stories revolve around sun wukong simply not bothering to inform his allies of the opponents special items and abilities
The good settings and cultural differences between the human regions are well written
 The stories themselves are varied in plots
 Anthony Yus notes are invaluable for readers who are not eastern culture buffs
The bad  The demons vary very little exept for in appearance
One demon sounds and acts almost identically to the next
 Tripitaka is still very annoying
 When sun wukong finally comes across a worthy challenge a bodhisattva is almost instantly introduced to resolve the situation
 Characters become feeble or genius level tactician and super slueth to fit the needs of the original author.
I have many translations of this Chinese classic as well as the original Chinese version
 If you want a real feel for this story you cannot go wrong with this version
 Yes it is long but so is the original
 If you are looking for a very condensed but well done version I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation
Its not what youd imagine from a journey novel
Challenges are overcome less so with violence and more with good ol trolling
Fun to read
This is a wonderful translation of one of the Chinese classics
Dont be intimidated by the length I never tired of the antics of the original Gang of 
I felt like I had to pick this series up after seeing so many TV sets in Viet Nam with monkey and pig guys flying around on them and Im glad I did.
Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book
 I recommend this and all the other volumes in this series by Mr
Yu to anyone interested in the culture history andor Tao  Well worth reading.
This is the third volume of Anthony C
Yus fourvolume translation of the Chinese classic The Journey to the West
The story continues to be fantastical violent and despite its episodic nature surprisingly compelling to me
I was reading the previous volume in parallel with Ken Lius The Wall of Storms
Once I started this third volume I decided to shelve Ken Lius book in favor of Tripitaka and Pilgrims continuing adventures
For a Chinese classic published over four hundred years ago the content is far less elevated and far more entertaining than Id expected
Consider for instance this edifying quote Even a fart is additional air I am now impatiently waiting for Amazon to deliver the final volume.
Of course this is Chinese culture
If you know Sun Wu Kong you know Chinese people
This edition is scholarly and brings the Jenner edition up to date.
great novel.
A great book
Ahead of its time
 Author did a magnificent job
A masterpiece
As expected
A book worth reading
Although reading the whole series in order is advisable
Enjoy the endless Wisdom offered
These books all four are very good read
Very entertaining and kept me occupied for a long time
Written in very simple English.
excellent
I have reached with sadness the end of my journey through the fourvolume fourhundredyearold Chinese classic The Journey to the West
I plodded through the lengthy but valuable introduction by the translator Anthony C
Yu then set off through the hundred fantastical chapters of the story
  It is not a journey for those who like their fiction in small doses
Nor does it fit the mold of most of the fantasy that I love
True there are dragons and monsters and mythic battles but of the two main characters one is an ugly ultraviolent supernatural monkey and the other is a timorous puritanical monk
Moreover the narration is less immersed in the characters viewpoints than I usually prefer partly because it frequently breaks into poetry
Perhaps the biggest departure from typical fantasy tomes is that the book is largely episodic
It journeys westward without much of a dramatic arc
While individual episodes have their battles and resolutions the characters and the situation change slowly sometimes imperceptibly
  Any or all of the above might have deterred me
Had I been in a more cantankerous mood perhaps they would have done so
Yet they did not
By and large I liked the digressions into poetry
I accepted the cowardice of one character the violence of the other the lessthanimmersive narration the episodic quality more common to television series than to novels
I liked the lightness of tone the sense of fun
Most of all I grew fond of the characters as I think the author was fond of them
I wanted to spend time in their company and am left now at the end of the long journey missing them.
Im paraphrasing my husband in this review or trying to
The Journey to the West was my birthday present to him  and he loved it
He read a couple of pages to me and it put me to sleep
Reading the complete work is a labor of love for a scholarly person deeply interested in sixteenthcentury Chinese culture and its integration of Taoism Buddhism and Confucianism
The four hefty volumes offer a mythological and allegorical version of Xuanzangs journey to acquire scriptures in India
Ordeals along the way illustrate the stages of spiritual transformation
Xuanzang and his disciples are manifestations of the religious seeker
Dealing with the ordeals reads a bit like a detective story
Investigation reveals that the demons are often escapees from heaven
According to my husband who read every word of the four volumes including the footnotes the series is a fabulous exposition of Taoist internal alchemy and Chinese Buddhism.
And it was a journey the second longest Ive taken but I am very glad to have read it
 Despite a lot of repetition this epic of Chinese literature held my interest through all four volumes and I think I learned a lot.
This is a translation of classic Chinese Buddhism tales
 The writing appears faithful the style of the Chinese stories and old styles of telling stories
 It is worth reading to get a better understanding of tales virtually every Chinese child learns at an early age
 The whole series helped me in my appreciation of Chinese culture.
Very readable translation
I dont know how accurate it is the poetry seems to be almost too good but I really enjoyed it
Those who are not familiar with this style might want to start with The Bandits of the Marsh or Romance of the Three Kingdoms before tackling the  volumes of the Journey to the West.
I have many translations of this Chinese classic as well as the original Chinese version
 If you want a real feel for this story you cannot go wrong with this version
 Yes it is long but so is the original
 If you are looking for a very condensed but well done version I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation
Fascinating look into the mythology of China.
Hey this is the Journey to the West
one of the best fantasy adventures of all times
 I wish I had read it as a child or had it read to me
It was extremely fun and entertaining
This was the first time I had read the novel
 I had seen a few movies that lead up to or were a truncated version of the actual story
 Finally learning who the Handsome Monkey King was enlightening and aided my comprehension of a Taoist text I had read that discusses the monkey mind frequently
 While the acknowledged hero in the story is the Buddhist monk who is sent on the journey to the west to retrieve sutras from the Buddha the real hero is Sun Wukong the Handsome Monkey King Hes the wildest hero Ive ever read about
 It takes a while to get the actual journey by all  pilgrims but I enjoyed reading how the Sun Wukong became the Monkey King and created such a ruckus in Heaven Anyone who ever created a comic book or animated superhero must have read or heard of this story and used a variety of Sun Wukongs powers to create their hero
 this will be yet another novel that Ill read at least once per year.
Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book
 I recommend this and all the other volumes in this series by Mr
Yu to anyone interested in the culture history andor Tao  Well worth reading.
A masterpiece
As expected
This non abridged version is much more enjoyable than an abridged version I read previously.
Best book ever written 
The Tang priest Monkey Pig and Friar Sand along with their horse  a transformed river dragon  have to travel from the Tang court in China to the Western Heaven
Their mission to retrieve the Scriptures from Buddha and deliver them to the Emperor
If they succeed China will become a happy prosperous place and the unjustly condemned souls will be rescued
But the journey is fraught with difficulties and deadly perils
In the end it takes  years in the process the four pilgrims meld themselves into a potent loyal team win through dozens of unheardof threats to life and limb and achieve enlightenment
This is another long classic in the spirit of Romance of the Three Kingdoms that goes on and on with twists and turns that take you by surprise except for the fact  spoiler alert  that you know that the four heroes must eventually win through deliver the Scriptures and achieve enlightenment
A lot of the Buddhist hierarchy shows up unbidden or is called upon for help by Monkey as he solves problem after problem on the journey West so its an entertaining introduction to those folks
The tone is lighthearted even the constant threats to the Tang priests life as monsters try to capture and eat him thereby obtaining eternal life by consuming a piece of his pure flesh have a funny side
A lot of humor is provided by the irreverent Monkey hes incapable of very much humility and constantly violates social conventions even in Heaven but his heart is usually in the right place
His capabilities are vast including being immortal and having the power to work all sorts of magic but his hubris often leads him astray
This is pitched as a childrens tale  although the occasional sex and almost constant fairytale violence might make it an older childrens tale  and the characters reflect childish impulsiveness and disregard for ceremony
Its a fun read and I was disappointed when it was over
Id recommend it
I currently own  different versions of Journey to the West and of the three this one is probably the best compromise between detail and brevity
I am currently reading it to my yearold I read it by myself a while ago and while the vocabulary is definitely a stretch I have to explain  or  words on most pages hes really loving it
The story has all the appeal of a Martial Arts novel The Wizard of Oz and a Buddhist philosophical treatise blended into a thoroughly entertaining tale for all ages
I previously read Adventures of Monkey King ISBN  to my son and while the language was much more appropriate for a young child the story was overly abridged and a lot of the detail that makes the story fun and interesting was lost
This edition tells the beginning and the end of the story very well but leaves out all of the middle episodes between finding the dragon horse Pigsy and Sandy and getting to the mountain of fire
 As a result Pigsy and Sandy are a bit underdeveloped but the Monkey King definitely gets a real chance to shine and you do get a decent feel for Pigsy and Tripitaka at least
 I kind of appreciate that they left the whole middle section out instead of picking random stories because that makes it easier to go back to the full version of the story Journey to the West Volume Boxed Set ISBN  and fill in the missing stories if you want to
The way its told here the actual journey itself is the smallest part of the story
 Its all about setting up the characters and reaching Inda
 In the fulllength version the story is mostly about the journey and how it changes the characters
This version is very good for those who want to get the flavor of the characters and find out what happens but the full version is best for those who really just want to enjoy reading about the Monkey King doing what he does best and arent anxious for it to end
 Be warned though the full version can drag a bit if youre hoping to actually see the plot move along
I have heard that the book MonkeyFolk Novel of China ISBN  best captures the comedic aspects of the story so that will be my next purchase
The British well really Chinese via Japan TV series Monkey is also based on this story
I discovered that it has recently been released on DVD in Australia and that a British release is coming that will include the  previously unaired Japanese episodes with subtitles
As the series was never aired in America I may need to buy a PAL DVD player to watch it so thats what I plan to do
The story is that good.
The only book out of dozen different authored ones
Includes the story of the monkey from the beginning  most books only start from the monk  written in plain English as English books   translated or not  should be  some books are written for and understood only by students and scholars 
Heavily shortened its alright overall but leaves a lot out
 Consider it a good primer for readers interested in the whole folklore of this legend but there are better options out there.
The book is difficult for most Western readers because some of the language is so fantastic in its description of all the different spirits monsters immortals etc
 But just stick with it and by the end of the book you will have an increased understanding of the mythology that works its way into a lot of Chinese Cultural opionions
I initially started reading this because it is one of what is touted as one of the essential Chinese classics and also because my wife who is Chinese was born in the Monkey Year and I was born in the Boar Year
 The  main characters of the novel are Monkey Pig Friar Sand and the brother of the Tang Emporer
 My former business partner is named Tang so for me the book was irresistable
But as I said the book is very long and the variety of monsters spirits immortals etc
is mind boggling but somehow at the end it makes a unified impression and from reading all the different subplots you gain an understanding of Chinese culture that simply cannot be gained without it
gjmugg
This translation skipped most of the adventures along the journey which were the best part of this classic.
I have read the printed version of the Journey to the West before and thought it would be nice to have the eBook version for my Android
 Its like visiting old friends when I read about the Monkey King Pigsy and the rest
 Plus its nice to be able to bring the book with me so I can read it when traveling or I have a few spare minutes
I believe eBooks are definitely the wave of the future and this one makes a nice addition to my electronic library
Thanks for reading
Brad
tame the ego and magic appears there are peaceful solutions to anything
 A delightful read of wisdom.
a wonderfully written book and full of life lessons.
The Journey to the West is a classic and its great read
Classic Chinese literature is poetic with life lessons all in a great adventure tale
The scene descriptions are hyperbolic but should be read as a tale being told to an audience.
Real good book Im keeping it in my libary for good
I had to read this book for an Asian religious studies class and it was by far one of my favorite readings from the class
Im a slow reader but I managed to finish this in the course of just a few days
The plot and characters really pull you in and its an easy read.
This is a solid translation of the work however there are many many embarrassing misspellings
For example youre became youve quite became quire etc
While these do not generally impede your understanding of the book it can be annoying
Also as mentioned before in another review the table of contents is useless no hyperlinks no chapter names.
It was probably the longest book Ive ever read and Im a voracious reader
Growing up in Chinese martial arts with a Taoist Si Fu and Buddhist Si Mu learning forms named after Sun Wukong and Immortals this book hit a sweet spot called home.
I tend to take forever finishing a book but this was such an enjoyable read I couldnt put it down
An interesting story and is a mustread for anyone majoring in history
This is THE story of China blending their animism with Buddhism Confucianism and Taoism.
This was a book used by my history class used to depict Buddhist Daoist and Confucianist ideals
This is a very fun read the chapters just fly by.
I really enjoyed it but there are too many long shots when nothing happens
one of four classics of ancient Chinese literature gives insight into the cultural outlook on self improvement with charm and humor
Amazing book So glad I found it again.
A fantastic epic tale
If you saw the TV show in the Eighties youll love the book
It brings Monkey  all your favourites back to life.
Loved it
Highly suggest.
This book is remarkable highly recommend
Great.
It is an amazing story with a lot of interesting characters not found in Western literature
If you want to understand Chinese religion mainly Buddhism and Daoism this is a good place to start.
Real nice been looking for it for a long time
This book is one of the  classics that Chinese children are studying during their school education
This one is probably too far from the Western cultural roots to make an easy reading yet it is worth the patience and sometimes the pain to go through some lengthy descriptions of places costumes characters..
for a Westerner seeking to better understand the Chinese psyche.
Brilliant witty touching and ridiculous
I loved it
Ill read it again
The boring bits can be breezed through all in all an amazing read
TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT...
This is a challenging book to review in that it is long as are the other classic Chinese epics Three Kingdoms Outlaws of the Marsh and Dream of the Red Chamber and accordingly contains much that will on the one hand provoke entertain and inspire the modern reader while also containing much many are likely to find infuriating
The basic plot is simple and wellknown and easily researchable on Wikipedia and other web sites
An emperor of Chinas Tang dynasty seeking enlightenment for his kingdom appoints a monk to journey to the west India to worship the Buddha and bring back the scripture
The monk has four disciples fallen beings who are being given a chance to redeem themselves who help him
These are the Monkey King the Pig and Friar Sand and the horse
Pig and Friar Sand were heavenly Generals who messed up and were put into the bodies of animals
The horse is a dragon who is working off a sin by being in the body of a horse
Monkey was born of stone and is redeeming himself after having caused considerable chaos in and even revolted against heaven taking on everybody there including the Jade Emperor a standin it seems for God
This is based on a true story wherein a Tang emperor really did send a monk on a mission to bring back Buddhist scripture and also gather information a Lewis  Clark type exploratory mission
Its a long trip accomplished on foot and for the monk horseback the main modes of transportation back then
The disciples can travel via cloud but not the monk
But in the epic the length of the trip is the least of the challenges
Again and again and again the party is beset by demons many of whom want to eat the monks flesh in order to gain eternal life something that is said to be possible given the monks purity
Unlike other famous fictional voyagers though this monk couldnt fight his way out from under a grain of rice
He spends pretty much the entire epic weeping and complaining
Its mainly Monkey helped more or less emphasis on less by the other disciples that constantly has to overcome the obstacles
The points of interest the good parts come from the nature of the adventures quite varied and imaginative and perhaps more important the key relationships between Monkey and the Monk between Monkey and the assortment of deities and between Monkey and the other disciples
The monk is the prototypical whiney nerd
As mentioned his specialties are weeping and complaining
Moreover he is fooled by more illusions than a tenyearold at a cheap magic show actually hes fooled by all illusions
Monkey on the other hand is the one who gets it
His ability to see whats real isnt quite  but its close and even when he errs he corrects himself very quickly
He is perhaps the single greatest most skilled and most powerful lots of magic powers sidekick in all of literature East or West
So youd think the Monk would revere and trust Monkey right Not so
The Monk does not trust Monkey at all and rejects his advice every time until he gets into a mess and has no choice to do what Monkey demands in order to escape the crisis only to distrust Monkey again next time
Twice in the epic Monk gets so angry at what he perceives to be a bad attitude on the part of Monkey he fires him kicks him out of the expedition but of course is force to be reconciled lest he wind up as dinner for a monster
But the Monk just doesnt learn
He continually trusts Pig whose main concern is his own indulgence
As to capabilities Pig is OK but a distant second behind Monkey
Im not sure why the author fusses about the horse and Friar Sand
Neither has any discernable personality and both seem to be there just to carry stuff
And this is where we begin to get into things that may annoy a modern Western reader
The practice of the art of fiction here is not what were used to
The epic relies a lot and I mean A HECK Of A LOT on a fictional technique known as deus ex machina which translates literally to God out of the machine
Its well known in ancient Greek theater
The author sets up a fascinating plot conflict and then finds himself unable to logically solve it so an actor playing one the Gods is lowered to the scene from a set of pulleys the machine to sort everything out
The Greeks get away with it because the conflict is usually more important than the details of how its resolved but even they dont completely escape criticism
In this epic deus ex machina is used constantly
Like the Greeks conflict and escape are paramount but with the Greeks you get one deus ex machina instance per play
Here it bombards you again and again and again time after time after time in the same epic to the point where it becomes tempting to skip ahead once the conflict is established because you pretty much know whats coming
In fact the adventures get so formulaic after a while you may wonder if this is really a single epic or something that was cobbled together from a lot of separate adventure stories
I have no idea what the answer is but in the work handed down to us the end implies it is a unified epic and that the crises were orchestrated from heaven to enable the Monk to become worthy of receiving the scriptures
But again I cant swear this wasnt grafted on at a later time
One of the things that leads me to wonder about this being a unified epic is the way the Monk fails to even start to come to grips with Monkeys merits until the very end
To a modern Western reader that defies belief and having read other ancient Chinese epics Im not in a hurry to attribute such shallow characterization to the epics different time and place
Also the underdeveloped characterizations of Friar Sand and the horse lead me to wonder if they were developed in other segments of the story that got lost or if the author intended to flash them out but never got around to it
Its important to note that my speculations as to whether this is a unified work or something that was patched together is just that personal speculation
I have absolutely no clue about the facts and havent at least not yet even checked to see if theres any research pointing one way or another
What Im suggesting to you as a reader of this review is to draw conclusions about the fact that I am so wrapped up in speculations like this
That tells you a lot about how the work is organized and how reading it feels as you get beyond the chapters of introductory material
Clearly though the most intriguing character and the one that makes the whole thing worthwhile is Monkey
His evolution from literatures most potent ahole to its most potent protector is riveting and addictive
Its a fascinating object lesson to anyone who has occasion to deal with difficult but talented people
The end of the story implies the monk needed to suffer to earn the right to get the scriptures
We modern folks though dont need to go through that
We can if we wish try to recognize the merit around us without constantly bringing ourselves to the brink of destruction.
Lost too much stuff including some most core stories
The pictures do not fit their descriptions
The worst version I have ever seen.
With the pandemic limiting bookstore browsing Im spending more time browsing my own bookshelves pulling out books that I meant to read but forgot
Im not sure exactly how Monkey A Journey to the West retold by David Kherdian ended up amongst my other books but Im glad it did
Apparently Monkey  a bit of Trickster like Coyote from some Native American legends only with a mean streak and a propensity for fighting and drinking and stealing and causing cosmic mayhem  is a folk story dating back to the sixteenth century
Its an allegory of the struggle we must all face before a spiritual transformation is possible
Like most great spiritual journeys Monkey is spurred by a desire to become immortal
Given that he was born from a magic stone fructified by the seeds of Heaven and Earth and by the essences of the sun and moon I think he might have been immortal to begin with but that point is lost on Monkey
He sets out to learn all the secrets which will lead to becoming immortal
Along the way he tangles with an incredible pantheon of gods lesser and greater and elders and spiritual leaders and demons and dragons
The list is so massive and most of the cultural references were completely lost on me
I wish there was a cheat sheet of characters to provide context because the significance of the Moon Goddess and Jade Emperor and Dragon King of the Western Ocean was obscure
Still the book was a joy to read and I really started to feel for Monkey especially after he got a mountain dropped on him for  years
I only wish the religious texts of my youth suffered in silent confusion on hard benches had a fraction of the energy passion and entertainment found in Monkey Furious Natha cried Change Whereupon he was transformed into a ferocious deity with three heads and six arms
His hands held six weapons a monsterslashing sword a monsterhacking scimitar a monsterbinding rope a monsterquelling club an embroidered ball and a fire wheel
Brandishing these weapons he charged Monkey
So youve a trick or two up your sleeve Monkey said
Well have a look at this Shouting Change Monkey turned into a demon with three heads and six arms
His cudgel had become three cudgels and grabbing each with two hands he engaged Natha in an earthshaking mountaintrembling battle
They flew through the air like meteors and clashed like lightning each parry and blow a thunderclap with sparks flashing across the skies like shooting stars
When I finished the book and was thinking through all the battles and shenanigans and cosmic forces I thought This would make an epic Kung Fu movie why hasnt anyone thought of that They did
I checked
There are dozens of them
Looking forward to watching them all.
Although plot detail and events are skipped for brevity Kherdian gives delightful dialog to his characters especially the Monkey King The Handsome Monkey King
 A reader feels that he has probably met someone  this brash and outrageous in real life
 The plot moves quickly for lively reading
 It is more engrossing and even more exciting than recent film treatments of the story
A good introduction to Journey to the West a Chinese classic novel
 Hopefully the reader will want to find out more about the story and also Chinese culture .
Monkey was not exactly what I was expecting
 From the description I thought this story would be heavily involved in Eastern Philosohpy and use analogies to explain the Buddhist Taoist and Confucianist dogmas
Instead the majority of the book describes the dozens of battles between monkey and various demons and spirits
 The specificstactics of these battles are described including weapons axes swords maces monkeys cudgel etc
the magical transformations used monkey growing to  feet tall or turning into a bird etc
and the status of the battle  rounds and noone gaining an advantage the opponents head being chopped off etc.
Although there is some discussion of monkeys training in The Way with some Taoist and Confucianist ideas and some of the Buddhist theories right action nonviolence the story is more focused on the adventures and battles of monkey and his master who is searching for Buddhist scrolls.
This is one of my favorite books that I will very seldom recommend to people
The reason for this is that while I found the long tangents odd storylines quirky characters and great length of the book to be fantastically entertaining I recognize that it is a very peculiar combination of elements that might not sit well with some
The book can also be somewhat repetitive on a superficial level though there was enough variance in each story to keep me interested
The book also can be rather longwinded at times but its often in a funny way.
This is a decent telling of the Chinese story but it doesnt deliver on its own promises Kherdian says that he includes more episodes and more of the spiritual aspects of the story than are found in the famous Arthur Waley version but sadly he does no such thing especially in a crucial and famous scene toward the end
Kherdians version is certainly readable and enjoyable but Waleys is more thorough and includes more of the religious elements of the original
However Kherdians version may be better for younger readers than Waleys as of the two abridgements it is the easier to read.
I just love the TV series monkey and the book is just as interesting
I found a really old copy at a junk sale
Before that I had no idea of the origin of the series
I just thought is was an amusing variation on samurai ninja type themes
The original text is however the reason for the depth of philosophical thought which the series contains
I have no idea whether the philosophy goes into kids heads or straight over them but they seem to love it and the book makes great bedtime reading for children who love the series.
Monkey King is one of the  top classics in Chinese literature
All my friends in Beijing told me I should read it first of the  and they chose well
Akin to the Wizard of Oz in America the story has many layers of meaning and provides significant insight into Chinese culture and thought patterns past and present
The story is easy to pick up and follow in episodes
I will confess that I skipped over some of the flowery and lengthy descriptive poetic sections but this is a good read
This edition is marred by having no good navigation system and by  occasionalrandom misspellings due to the linguistic mindset of the Chinese translators.
This translation of the classic Chinese novel is not nearly as good as the previous Arthur Waley edition also available from Amazon
 This edition has the advantage of being greatly simplified and therefore may be more suitable for young readers
 Fans of the Waley edition might also be interested in this edition as a source for a few slightly different stories selected from the much longer original
 However this edition eliminates much of the texture of the original and is overall much much shorter than Waleys
 Most readers would be far wiser to choose Waleys classic edition
 This is a poor substitute at best except possibly for children.
While this is the only version of the Monkey King story that I have read I have read other Eastern philosophy stories and I have to say that this version is definitely the most readable of all of them
That being said I did find the story to be a little light on the Eastern wisdom it was meant to deliver
However if youre looking for a fun story based on some Eastern principles to read to your children this could be it.
If  you are a huge fan of the Journey to the West do not purchase this abridgement buy the whole  volume set also available on Amazon
 Otherwise the translation and abridgement here is fine for a quick fun read.
This book is fantastic Its a great read but thats just me because I love Asian myths and things of the sort
But few know that this book is the basis of the incredibley popular anime Dragon Ball Z
Yes thats right im not making this up this is  true
If you look up the story for dragon ball the first in the series of dbz you will find that it is incredibley similar to this book
Monkey represents Son Gokou the pig represents oolong the great king of the mountain is ox king
If you are a big time DBZ fan like me read this book and find out the origin.
I waiting a long time to read this book imswr very interested in Chinese mythology so far I have enjoyed the story..thank you Amazon for your prompt service I also have a kindle fire wihich I also enjoy very much
I downloaded the sample for this and found the TOC worthless
Chapter  to Chapter  are listed
But they arent even hyperlinked
Any other decent sample book Ive tried has a hyperlinked TOC
I deleted it then and there
Found a free copy elsewhere on the web with hyperlinks and even quick chapter summaries
That ones a keeper.
I really loved this book it passed the time really fast and I liked the book so much I finished it in only  hours.
I have loved Monkey King since I was a little lad waiting for it to come on the tv so I decided to read the actual book and events and I have enjoyed every single page so far
Sometimes a little hard to grasp but I get there eventually
well worth it for any Far East lover or Monkey fan.
Very rarely does a story jump out of the book and strike you square in the imagination with such impact as Wu Chengen Journey to the West
It not only is a tale of monsters demons and devils it also sends the message of peace and tolerance in the form of the Buddhist monk Sanzang known better in the West as Tripitaka set in a time of great upheaval not only in China but throughout the world
It is a mix of established Chinese mythology and beliefs combined with historical events and the creative genius of Wu Chengen
I have read this book many times by many different translators and it never fails to please
Do yourself a favour and buy this book.
An excellent read I highly recommend this book.excellent service by the supplier.
Very interesting thanks JNR
Wonderful story although it does seem to suffer from a few OCR faults but those are of a minor nature and dont affect the readability of the book.
First experienced this through the animation adaptation of Dragonball
 Reading through this has been one of the best reading experiences I have had the pleasure of encountering I would highly recommend this to anybody and everybody.
This Kindle version  Monkey  Journey to the West  appears to be the entire unabridged version of the story
 I also have the printed unabridged version which consists of  volumes totaling  pages  Journey to the West 
 I compared the entire first chapter of this Kindle version with the aforementioned printed version and its the same wordforword
 I point this out as there are a few abridged versions available
So the story
 It dates back from the Ming Dynasty somewhere around the s and was I believe initially produced in installments
 For those of you familiar with the Japanese TV series Monkey you will recognize the characters in the book
 The first part of the book focuses on Monkey his birth his ascension to the King of the Monkeys his going to and subsequent dismissal from Heaven
 The next part of the book introduces the rest of the team Triptaka Sandy Pigsy and the Horse
 Then the book goes into the adventures the team have as chronicled in the aforementioned TV series
The formatting of the Kindle version is very good and I have yet to find any of the infamous typos and poor format found in some Kindle books
 The formatting is not as good as the print version the chapter subheadings appear to be continuous with the text of the book but then again you cant really expect it to
So allinall I am delighted with this purchase and I would recommend this version to fans of the TV series who want to learn more about Monkey and who enjoy a good read.
Ich wollte die Reise nach Westen schon lange lesen und habe es mit einer Adaption der WJF Jenner bersetzung Beijing  versucht
Die war so abschreckend umfangreich und detailiert weit ber  Seiten und unverstndlich geschrieben dass ich es nach nichtmal  Seiten aufgegeben habe und mich jahrelang nicht mehr an die Geschichte herangetraut habe
Dann bin ich quasi zufllig auf die Adaptionen von Shambhala Classics gestoen und wollte es doch noch mal mit der Reise nach Westen versuchen
Diese Fassung der Geschichte war flink weggelesen
Verstndlich geschrieben aber stark gekrzt
Ein bisschen zu stark fr meinen Geschmack
Oft hatte ich das Gefhl Sachverhalte oder Beschreibungen nur sehr skizzenahft bermittelt zu bekommen
Ebenso fehlt jegliche Poesie die in der Vorlage ja eine groe Rolle spielt
Aber naja um einen Einblick in die Geschichte zu bekommen reicht es
Man hat sie gelesen man kann mitreden als ob ein Gesprch jemals wirklich das Buch thematisieren wrde..
Mir als unkonzentrierten Leser kam es ja auch iwo entgegen
Inhaltlich kann ich nur sagen dass Handsome Monkey King aka Great Sage Equal of Heaven echt nen verdammtes Aloch ist
Ich meine dass er nicht gerade ein moralisches Vorbild ist war mir schon klar aber wow
Selten so einen nichtmgenswerten Protagonisten erlebt.
Wunderschn geschrieben leicht verstndliches und bilderreiches english
Dieses Buch berzeugt durch seine Gabe den Leser zu fesseln und schafft es selbst bei weniger als  Seiten die Charaktere lieb zu gewinnen zu lassen und einen gewogenen Werdegang sowie die Spannung zu erhalten
Gute nicht allzu anspruchsvolle Kost aber english Klasse  sollte es schon sein sonst entziehen sich einem  so manche Eindrcke und bildliche Ebenen die doch die eigentlichen inneren Bilder erst schaffen.
Its hard to know how to review this one
It does indeed appear to be the Unabridged edition of Journey to the West translated by W.J.F
Jenner which is in copyright and published by Foreign Language Press in four volumes
This edition certainly has some errors of the kind consistent with OCR and suffers from poor formatting and a lack of a table of contents  which for a work of this size is badly needed
It also lacks any copyright information failing even to credit the translator and doesnt include the extensive introduction of the FLP edition
It is published by an unknown publisher called Monkey King
So you can draw your own conclusions and for myself I suggest instead that you buy the FLP edition here Journey to the West
  BR
Im a Chinese speaker but my daughter isnt
She has heard about the monkey king from us and was interested in hearing the story so we ordered this book
The translation is slightly awkward especially the inconsistent translation of names some are translated by meaning such as Piggy and some are phonetic translations of the Chinese name such as Xuan Zeng
I find myself frequently making changes to the translation or adding explanations to make it more understandable or interesting to my daughter
That being said I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be to translate this particular story into English and abridge it for young readers so Im not sure if there are much better versions out there or not.
Long ago I saw on TV a Chinese series on this story without subtitles so I was looking for an English version to read
 This gave me the basic story line but is definately for beginning readers
 Has a shortened story line with a play version included and a vocabulary section for the meanings of the words
 Great for teaching purposes for st through rd graders.
Enjoyed.
The quality of the book is very good the content translation is very good and the mailing is very smooth.
I became interested in this book after watching Forbidden Kingdom
The story of the Monkey King is thoughtful and entertaining
 The Kindle edition was a no brainer at  cents
 The translation is fantastic and it reads like it was written with English being its original language
 Highly recommend to anyone interested in the Monkey King andor Asian history.
Journey to the West has truly stood the test of time
A fun read hundreds of years after it was written.
Love this book so much I bought it for my children as I absolutely love everything journey to the west since growing up loving the TV show monkey
The pictures are great and the story well put together
Love this thank you
Wasnt what i expected too childish
I gave it as a gift.
Beautifully printed plain language and images to foreign readers to understand the Journey to the West story.
The Journey to the West is one of the Four Great works of Chinese literature
 Kathryn Lin retells this story in a format accessible to young and very young children
 Each of the  pages of this book is richly illustrated with numerous bright eyecatching watercolors and drawings
 Although this is not a bilingual book for  parents wishing to expose their children to Chinese language or culture at an early age the author intersperses common Chinese characters along with pronunciation and a concise definition
The character of the Monkey King is reminiscent of Curious George
Or one could say Curious George is reminiscent of the Monkey King
 I highly recommend this book to parents who want to familiarize  their children to another culture especially those with children who already have an interest in Sagwa Mulan or other Chinesethemed childrens books.
Amazingly well done and beautiful art
Great intro book for little ones to learn about the monkey king and his story
Really cute book and easy to read
Pictures are watercolor and nicely done bright
The length of it was also enough to be a good story time book
Good addtion for a childs library
Would recommend.
What more could you ask for in a childrens book The beautiful illustrations will charm young children and parents alike
Lin brings the Monkey King to life making him into a spunky funny and lovable protagonist
Lin writes a Chinese story for a Western audience providing parents the perfect opportunity to expose their children to a culture different from their own
How clever of Lin to write this story Bravo.
Like the author I also grew up with stories of the Monkey King Wukong
 This is a great retelling of story
 I love the illustrations  I am buying a copy for my nephew.
Love the book The story is interesting and fun
I bought one for my niece as her birthday gift
She really enjoys the story and learns Chinese words
Highly recommended
Now for the diatribe
 This is the nd translation I have read
For the westerner all the Chinese names can get confusing
One approach is to imagine an Asian coming to America and all your friends names are Smith Jones and Williams
At least I know quite a few and they are NOT related
This translation actually has an appendix in the nd volume that lists all the names
REALLY HELPFUL   Personally I started reading the st translation I have in four volumes not for sale in the USA as the tv series Game of Thrones got into its nd season
My friends who I watch it with are fanatics about the series
makes sense it has been the  TV show several years running
For me the Three Kingdoms has been much more enjoyable
Sometimes history is just better than the the most creative fiction
Now this is a romanticized version of a piece of early Chinese history almost  years ago
Every so often I have to remind myself that this stuff essentially did happen
There is one scene an event in actual history regarding some actions by Cao Cao that is well still talked about today in China and a very dark stain to Chinese history
OK so there are some serious stains in Scottish and western history.
  As a westerner I have to keep reminding myself that so much of what I am reading did actually happen
Even when I step away and remind myself that the author himself or whom this writing is  accredited to lived centuries later
Well the authors time is STILL over  years ago Step away from Games of Thrones or better since the series has to wait for the author to catch up use that break and read this series
Dont worry if all the names and locations appear confusing
Just read it
I read half of it over two days nonstop
fortunately it was the weekend and I am NOT a bookworm
It is hard to get me to sit down and read something
Perhaps I am praising this work too much..
However I really feel that this story is one that every westerner in the st century should read
It will not explain China or even Asian culture today
As it is considered one of the  classics in Asian culture
It is Camelot on steroids
It almost puts the American Civil War to sleep and as a proud American I wish the story of our founding fathers could be half as exciting
Have fun and good luck  Dont try to read it on the bus or during your lunch break
You might get fired for no showing up to work..
Moss Roberts translation is absolutely fantastic
Much more alive than others
Take the opening sentences Here begins our tale
The empire long divided must unite long united must divide
Thus it has ever been
Compare this with Taylors translation Domains under heaven after a long period of division tends to unite after a long period of union tends to divide
This has been so since antiquity
Or Hegels Empires wax and wane states cleave asunder and coalesce
Its really no contest
Roberts prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout
Hes that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose
The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes and there are a lot are at the back of the nd volume which means that while reading the first twothirds of the epic you have to carry around both volumes and these are big heavy books
I dont know if there are other highquality printings of Roberts translation which might improve on this issue but I wouldnt even consider a different translator
This review is a duplicate of the one I submitted for volume 
Good book
Accurately described.
Thank you.
I first encountered Moss Roberts translation in a greatly abridged version which I took with me on my first trip to China
 It greatly increased my enjoyment of the trip
 Now Dr
Roberts has completed his translation of the whole novel
 It is much more readable than the only other complete translation in English that of BrewittTaylor
 Many centuries of Chinese have used this book to gain wisdom about politics and war I highly recommend that you take a look.
A True classic
Timeless classic
 Very nice paper binding
Its like lord of the rings but Asian you should play dynasty warriors  and watch redcliff to get a feel for it or even read toilkens books to get you in the mood
Well written.
Great package with protection
I receive it in a week
Take care about additionnal cost for TVA of your own country Nothing to say good job
As a kid one of my favorite video games was   on the NES
 I played that game until TWO cartridges died from usage
 Later on Playstation I found   and noticed a lot of similar names
 I played it and it was FANTASTIC
 I thought I was fulfilled in my living of Chinese mythhistory until my mother bought me this four volume set for Christmas
 I was dumbfounded and immediately tore the plastic wrapping off and started reading
 They were all there
 All my favorite characters in my favorite games were all there and now they had depth they were people on the page in print living out the digital approximations I had loved so much
 Watching the formation of the Kingdom of Shu lead by the virtuous Liu Bei and Guan Yu with insurmountable strategist Zhuge Liang as the Prime Minister seeing the powerhungry Cao Cao usurping the Han Emperors throne the brilliant but always foiled plans of Zhou Yu to kill Zhuge Liang this wonderful story woven through each volume is PURELY RIVETING  Play the games  Buy the books Live the adventure
I was at home with two cars in the drive delivery instructions clearly stated if not at home leave in rear porch
The driver went to the rear porch which has a closed but unlocked door but rather than place them inside the porch he took the lazy option and placed the package on the Milk Box to the right of the porch door
It should be noted that the goods which were in Amazon eminently recyclable but soluble packaging  it was pouring with rain and the packet contained expensive text books
Had they not have been urgently required for an academic thesis I would have returned them
However the need was great and half an hour of careful application of a hairdryer  allowed  the pages of the uppermost volume to to separate and thus be read
Amazon is a convenient way to buy textbooks and other goods but the regularity of of crass stupidly by couriers who leave expensive items on the front doorstep and so visible from an adjacent footpath solid state electronics left exposed to the elements  and even albeit boxed  jewelry resting against some outer door
Risky inconsiderate and positively the act of the indolent and those who speed rather than adhering to the instructions recorded against the delivery advice EMail..
A long read but possibly he best and most engrossing book Ive ever read
 A massive cast of characters fortunately theres a list of characters to refer to at the back of the book
 Footnotes help with the context but are out of the body of the text so dont interfere with the flow of the story
 The writing style of the translator makes the book very readable and it cracks along at a fair pace
great condtion excellent service  a really good read
I highly recommend this outstanding two volume set to anyone interested in the classic literature of China
Terrific in terms of both content and shelf appeal its a must have for avid readers of great works.

This item arrived quickly and in good condition
 I hope I have purchased that right Part  as there were more than one book with the same title but nothing to indicate which book comes with.
Super interesting book I read it twice
At 
with enabled table of contents excellent value
There are no notes nor explanatory matter
If the great number of characters is confusing you can find maps relationship charts and other resources at the Kingdoms Podcast site.
Great story
Well made book
Fast shipping
The print is tiny to the point of being too hard for these old eyes to read
Invest the extra money for a legible print size
What else can I say
good read
Excellent book about the Romance warring era
Just wish the print was a little bigger
Tons of characters to keep track of too.
This edition of the Chinese classic has print thats unreadably tiny
 The print margins are nearly nonexistent and the prints uneven on the pages
 I had to send it back.
One word Epic
Exactly what i expected and arrived early.
Print size so small it gave me a headache
Im talking pocket bible size font...beware.
A lot of life lessons can be learned with an open mind.
Awesome read a little slow in its pacing but what do you expect The material predates us all.
The problem Im having is distinguishing numerous characters from the locales mentioned
 There is very little basis to differentiate people from places as the names are so similar in spelling and the characters are many....
Probably very interesting but I could not handle the huge number of names that came up
 Very difficult to keep track of whos doing what.
Translation BrewittTaylor  chapters  words Suggestions for more enjoyable reading are at the bottom of his review
Ive yet to run across another book that has done a better job of integrating combat action strategy tactics and politics
 In spite of its length I never got tired of reading it
 It leaves an impression the further you readas I progressed through the book I noticed that I began to think more strategicallylike a chess player
This is a historical novel not an authoritative history text
 The history text of this period was RECORDS OF THE THREE KINGDOMS and like many works of fiction based on history many parts of the ROMANCE can only have been speculation
 Also skeptics might be unimpressed by the accounts of the supernatural visions omens prophetic dreams some of them horrible nightmares miracles ghosts etc
But the ROMANCE stands on its own as a work of fiction
 And not only do the supernatural events add a dash of spice theyre also important in illuminating whats going on underneath the worldly events
 For example the fantastic account of Daoist magician Zuo Ci is probably as close to a peyote vision as most of us will ever get
 But it also presents us the enigma of powerful men
 Cao Cao was a great military leader and political ruler but Zuo Ci offers him a chance to become a god
 You would think that godhood would be irresistable but Cao Cao cant give up his earthly power and his yearning to defeat and dominate other mortals
 In spite of that powerful men are also hungry for supernatural powers
 They need to see the future and science only takes them so far
 They also have to dabble in religious thinking because everyone down to the humblest peasant takes the mandate of heaven very seriously
 Its so serious that it starts a civil war in China possibly the hardest country in the ancient world in which to wage a civil war due to its massive geographic size
This is also the story of effective military leaders and advanced military technology in the ancient world
 There were great strategists and generals like Cao Cao Jia Xu Xu Huang Cheng Yu Guo Jia Lu Xun Sima Yi Deng Ai and especially Zhuge Liang
 I wish that more of the tactics that were mentioned had been fully described but there were plenty of details
 For example The Shu army suffered a major setback because of one bad gully
 Combats involved not only swordsmen but also messengers logistics engineers tunnels fortifications moats mounds catapults archers incendiaries and riverine warfare
 Zhuge Liang even invented some kind of supply railroad disguised as livestock
 Even tribesmen had metallic carriages
 This is one of the best novels Ive ever read

stars Suggestions for more enjoyable reading 
The first third of the book is essentially background
The story of how the Han dynasty became three separate kingdoms will be told here
The problem for you if youre a Westerner like me is that it is chock full of Chinese names
In the course of the book youll become familiar with Liu Bei Guan Yu Zhang Fei Cao Cao Sun Quan Sima Yi and Zhuge Liang
You might want to be aware of great generals and strategists like Cheng Yu Guo Jia Jia Xu Lu Xun and and Xu Huang
But there are hundreds more and theyre not always easy to remember
Therefore make a cheat sheet with what I would consider to be the most important names along with a small bit of biographical information on each
 Try to limit this information to their rank skill and who they servedYou want to avoid including spoiler data
 Do this for the names Ive already mention and add Chen Gong Cheng Pu Ding Yuan Dong Zhuo Fan Chou Guo Si He Jin Huangfu Song Jian Shuo Li Jue Li Su Lu Bu Lu Zhi Ma Teng Tao Qian Wang Lang Wang Yun Xun Yu Yuan Shao Zhang Ji Zhang Yang Zhou Yu and Zhu Jun
You should be able to ignore the rest
 The good news is that after the background is covered there wont be many more names to remember

Youll enjoy the book much more if you have a set of good maps
 If your edition of the book lacks maps you can find decent maps on the internet
 I found two or three maps that were useful
 I found the most useful map by googling Map of the Three Kingdoms and then downloading the map with the white land mass with the word WEI in blue SHU in red and WU in green
 The problem is that this map is huge
 What I did was to use my graphics software to cut this map into smaller pieces
 The best idea is to cut them centering on the borders of the kingdoms because thats where the battles will be
 I printed the JPG as a PDF document
 Then I found an online utility that converted PDF to MOBI format and put the maps on my Kindle or did I just put the PDF on the Kindle  Try both to see which works
 It was a bit of a pain to keep leaving the book to look at the maps but at least I had some sense of where these guys were fighting.
If one likes reading the bible and who begets who this is the book for you
Boring boring boring
It is by far the worse book I have ordered from Amazon ever.
This is a must read book for anybody who enjoys historical novels and for people who love strategy and battles.
I cant finish all my compliment for this book in this short review
You are not gonna believe it is such a splendid book until you read it yourself
This book is a saga with so much wisdom and humanity
It is as good as ancient Greek epic with all repect to Greek if not better
The wisdom in it is uncommonly plentiful
Trojan horse looks childrens game after you finished the book
Romance of three kingdoms is a part of Chinese lives and now becoming popular in the world
Many Japanese companies make this book as a mustread for management staff
Read this book and I garantee that your time will be delightfully spent.
boring boring
Massive book
Quite hard to handle
Not for the fainthearted.
A very precise translation of this book
Excellent for students.
Eu comprei esse livro depois de ver um vdeo na internet sobre o perodo dos Trs Reinos na China
Foi uma compra meio impulsiva mas o preo estava to bom que decidi tentar
E no me arrependo de nada
O livro  um relato altamente ficcionalizado do perodo em outras palavras no leia como um livro de histria muito seriamente mas os personagens o enredo no devem em nada para uma obra similar de hoje como Game of Thrones e honestamente enquanto eu no consegui passar do primeiro captulo de GoT eu li at o final desse livro
O que mais me impressionou foram os personagens voc  capaz de ver personagens to humanizados  incrvel um autor do sculo XIV entende muito melhor disso do que vrios autores modernos
O que  divertido  ver planos se empilhando sobre planos e d para criar momentos de imprevisibilidade
Tambm se adiciona o fato que o livro tem uma aplicao dos princpios de estratgia chinesa por exemplo generais que estudaram bastante A Arte da Guerra mas no sabem improvisar so considerados ruins
O livro  longo mas os captulos tm um tamanho muito bom para a leitura lendo um captulo por dia tipo antes de dormir d para ler o livro inteiro em menos de meio ano se os ganchos permitirem porque todo captulo tem um gancho para o prximo
A traduo  uma verso antiga de domnio pblico mas que deve dar para o gasto apesar de alguns problemas alm do mais a presena de arcasmos ajuda no clima do livro.
 pour le produit en lui mme  cest une belle collection
le papier est fin et agrable au toucher  de bonne qualit solide
Le texte est propre et de jolie police la traduction parfaite
petit plus  cest une traduction chinois  partie gauche et francaise  partie droite  qui plaira aux rudits ou  ceux qui parlent  ou sentraine  parler  les deux langues

No complaints nor issues
 Arrived on time and as described
I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend to others.
Letters too small and poorly laid out.
excellent thanks
A must have classic
If you are going to start reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms then you should start with this book series
This edition is more coherent and well put together with footnotes at the bottom and end of each chapter
There is a character list in the beginning with brief descriptions
The names and places are spelledpronounced more accurately
This series is a MUST for any fan of classical literature.
Best translation that I have of the series
I have  different ones
Very happy with this book.
Wow.
never thought i would finish these  novels
The vastness of the stories explain much of china today its people culture and even its politics
Very excellent translation.
bravo
It makes the great classic available to readers who are more comfortable witj English yet retains the feel of the original language
This is especially evident in the translated poems.
My year old LOVES this book
Hes read it twice already.
Its great as long you dont steal it
Vol
 provides an exciting conclusion to the preceding volumes
In Volumes  and  Zhuge Liang has masterminded with clever maneuvers victory at the Battle of Red Cliff against Cao Coa and then gone on to capture important cities thus vastly increasing Liu Beis military power with additional soldiers and control of wealthy cities and provinces
Liu Bei dies in Vol
 leaving control of his kingdom to his son Liu Shan
Cao Cao seeks to take advantage of Liu Beis death and inexperience of Liu Shan
Cao Cao comes up with a cunning scheme to attack Liu Shans kingdom from five directions
I was anxious to read how Zhuge Liang was going to deal with this new threat
However he reclused himself in his hut and would not come out
Finally after  days Liu Shan goes to Zhuge Liangs hut to hear what plans he has in mind
Zhuge Liang has brilliant plans to thwart each of the five attacks
He will himself lead the attack again the fierce Man tribes
In his fight against the Mans after the battle he releases their leader on the faith of his good word that they will not fight again
This happens six times that Zhuge Liang battles and has victory over the Mans each time capturing the leader and releasing him
After the seventh time Zhuge Liang refuses to even see the leader of the Mans and has his assistant release him
At this the leader of the Mans was so humiliated that he agreed to have a peace alliance with Liu Shan and have peaceful cooperation in the future
The Three Kingdoms story is truly one of the great classics of literature
This translation is easy reading
The footnotes were not only helpful but at those special key locations in the writing the footnotes at the bottom of the page made the flow of the story more meaningful.
Excellent books to read
This review is really for all three of the books as I have read them in their entirety
Collectively these can be a difficult read from the perspective of so many historical figures coming and going particularly later on in the series
 I have pretty extensive knowledge of this era of history so it was fine with me but just a note for anyone who knows little about people of this time that your head might spin a bit with so many character introductions
In terms of the story itself Vol  and  are wonderful full of action and intruigue
 Vol ..
while historically what it was I found arduous to read through
 This isnt the fault of the authors nor the translation its just not very interesting in terms of what happened near the end of the period especially in comparison to they first two volumes
 The figures of the later part of this time just feel flat as compared to their predecessors
There are some editing errors typos etc
and some odd word choices considering the context hubbub seriously And siesta I laughed when I read this used
So I definitely recommend it with the caveats in mind.
good
This is a highly disappointing book.
NOTE This is a review for all three volumes of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms I had been aware of this epic of Chinese literature for many years but first developed a serious interest in reading it after having watched the excellent Chinese drama adaptation made in 
That gave me the impetus to pick up the first volume and give it a go
Some words of caution first from one who has now read all three volumes
This is a book that very much requires you to juggle hundreds of names in your head and keep track of who is who
Indeed I would strongly recommend watching that aforementioned TV series prior to reading the books
This may sound the wrong way around but having made my way through all  pages it would have been considerably harder without some preknowledge of key characters to anchor my progress
Having some understanding for example that a Lu Su matters where a Lu Xun does not certainly makes getting through the book a mite less daunting
Another warning for those considering embarking on the Three Kingdoms if you are not interested in military strategy and take no pleasure in reading about the minutiae of war you should probably turn away
A significant percentage of the book is spent on detailing battles many many battles often in quick succession
While war itself is not the core of what the Three Kingdoms is about it is nevertheless the medium through which many of the storys messages are related
This is a fictionalised account of a very real historic period in Chinese history
After the fall of the Han dynasty in  AD the country fell into a state of civil war as rival warlords fought one another for superiority  each claiming to be the rightful successor to Han
Gradually power consolidated around three separate kingdoms Wei in the North Wu in the South and Shu in the West
Each was led by its own charismatic leader  Cao Cao Sun Quan and Liu Bei respectively
The Romance of the Three Kingdoms tells their story how they rose to power what they did with that power and how each ultimately fell
It is truly epic in its scale and widely recognised in China as one of the greatest books ever written
For me this book is about much more than just a historic narrative
Still less is it a book merely about military tactics  although they certainly feature prominently throughout
Rather the Three Kingdoms represents an insightful penetrating look at power  how it can be won how it can be maintained and how it can be lost
Each of the three rulers demonstrates different virtues and flaws and is aided by a wide variety of generals and advisers each with their own agendas
The ruthlessness of Cao Cao is tempered by his intellectual brilliance and his ability to exercise power without ever openly admitting to it
The virtue of Liu Bei meanwhile is undone by his inability to win his own battles and by his undying loyalty to those who do not always serve him best
The astuteness of Sun Quan is highlighted by the way in which he employs people best suited to the role implicitly acknowledging his own shortcomings
Each ruler has a coterie of advisers and the relationship between power and those who would shape and direct that power is fascinating
Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi both stand out as impressive figures in their own right often outshining the men they exist to serve
Their interplay in particular is a highlight of the book
And it would be remiss of me not to mention Liu Beis two brothersinarms Zhang Fei the oftdrunk and irascible warrior and Guan Yu the legendary fighter who keeps his honour to his very last breath
Another lesson the Three Kingdoms teaches is that for all the struggles and grand designs winning or losing may very often lie in the lap of the gods
A rainstorm at the wrong moment or a change in the direction of the wind can make all the difference
Illnesses strike down otherwise undefeated veterans just as ultimately the collapse of the three kingdoms ends up owing more to the dissipation and idleness of the rulers successors than to any great military victory
Power is ephemeral and it cannot ever be taken for granted
There are so many stories and subplots woven into the fabric of the Three Kingdoms that it would be both infeasible and futile to assess them all here
The best I can say of this book is that it is a joy to read and its many pages a wonderful place within which to lose yourself
It is long and there will be times when you may wonder if the battles will ever end with one siding achieving anything close to a significant victory but stick with it and you will be rewarded.
I really enjoy this book although I have a little trouble with the translations I find myself rereading some sentences
But its a great read for history buffs and fans of the Dynasty Warriors games.
I think this is the third different Three Kingdoms version that I buy on Amazon and I really like it
The novel is awesome just check wikipedia for the plot and the pinyin names help a lot the Dynasty Warriors fans like me.
I dont know who is to blame for this unreadable mess but..
DANG
One of the four classic books of Chinese literature
An epic journey to an age of heroes I really enjoyed this book even if the maps are not the best ones...
Not a review of the book but rather a review of this edition
It is filled with grammatical errors and typos
Awful and unreadable and Im really disappointed that I both the entire set of the books since they seem so poorly done
I read  pages before giving up
Almost unreadable if you care about grammar at all  there was an error in the first sentence domains tends to unite.
This version is horrible
The translator paraphrases so liberally that it actually takes away from the story
Other reviews mentioned that there are tons of grammatical errors and they were correct
These two facts make it a pain to read  not to mention the size of the books  they are heavy and huge  and mine had almost  margins along the pages with text on about  of each page
This made the book unwieldy
I would say Moss Roberts version is far superior in every aspect.
The book is a good read for people who wish to learn Chinese history or have some understanding of Chinese history
Its pretty hard
Anyway both books arrived in excellent condition and on time
Thank you
I just got back from China and was in that area thats why wanted to read the book
I ordered the print version of this book Silk Pagoda  from my local bookstore and when it arrived I noticed after maybe  sentences in that it was rife with typos
Maybe a page in I began to suspect whether it was even editedproofed by someone fluent in English
Then I went on to Amazon to look for another version of Romance of the Three Kingdoms from a reputable press Tuttle Classics  that uses the C.H
BrewittTaylor translation and the text was totally different I am pretty sure this is some kind of knockoff ripoff bootlegged text
I havent gotten around to getting a better copy and reading the story which I am sure is excellent its a major Chinese classic after all but if youre going to read Romance in English get a real translation.
There is no denying that Dream of Red Mansions Hong Lou Meng is an important piece of Chinese literature
However I did not really enjoy this book
I found the characters to be frustrating and the pace slow
Although this is the abridged version it is still extremely long and not an easy read
I cant imagine how long reading the unabridged version would take
Although I did not enjoy reading this book it is a critical piece of Chinese literature
The book moves slowly through various episodes in Jia Biaoyu and Lin Diayus life demonstrating a new type of novel  the chainlink novel that could be read by the masses
The book also gives insight to Chinese culture
While not my personal taste this is a good book for those studying Chinese literature.
the book was stuck and squeezed too hard into the mailbox therefore the cover is kind of scratched and the surface of the paper broke a little bit
 Since it is a gift I am not quite like it this time.
This is a must read for every culture
Beautifully written novel based on Chinese history during the end of the Ching dynasty
Difficult to set down once you pick it up.
A Dream of Red Mansions is a wonderful book to read over and over again you will come away with a different feeling every time you read it.
This translation conveniently comes in a complete set of  volumes
 The cost per book is great at a little over  per book vs
the  per book for Penguins volume series
Each volume is quite thick
 The entire series is a little over  pages so itll take a long time to read
 I find the translation to be satisfactory especially of the poems
 The story is engrossing and keeps me turning page after page
 I often go back to reread beautiful passages
 Occasionally there are some illustrations
There are some areas in which the book could improve
The multitude of characters and relationships makes it difficult to follow sometimes
 There is a family tree on one page but the printing is unclear and small
 I had to find a family tree online to consult instead
The glossary is too brief
 I wish that the notes were in more detail as sometimes I feel I am missing out a lot of the symbolism and such while reading the book
Lastly I wish that the aesthetics of the book matched the beauty of the story more
 Its slightly unfortunate that they just put the title in the Impact font on the spine...
The Foreign Language Press has also translated the other  greats of Chinese literature  Journey to the West  Outlaws of the Marsh  Romance of the Three Kingdoms I have read all of the previous  and been favorably impressed in the quality of the translations as well as the comprehensiveness of including the full novel
Other translations I have tried to read had more flowery but less accurate prose or were abridged
It also helps that they are using modern Romanization guides vs
the old WadeGiles which is a must for anyone taking Chinese classes as the WadeGiles system has been out of use for decades
If you have never read one of these four classics then dont look anywhere else and get this version of the books
If you have tried to read these before in a different setting but been unhappy then give these a go
 This is as good as it gets and you owe is to yourself to reread them in a correct translation
Yes the pages can be thin at times but thats a minor annoyance compared to the quality of the translationtext.
This is long and very detailed and discusses chinese life at a time in history but it takes commitment to read it
 Kind of like War and Peace sometimes too long and frustrating as you read but wonderful once you finish
It will take a while to finish but I love the book so far
I love these books  I love the font the size of the books and just tge general feel of them  I truly enjoy reading and I have a deep desire to learn about other cultures and their stories
Ive stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book which contained only  pages and Ive so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering which amounts to almost  pages
There are two fully unabridged translations and this one is simply excellent
Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate and the style more than satisfactory doing honor to the unique original book Im sure
The story takes place in old China describing the life of a young nobleman inspired by the authors only son who died young his rich background his loves and disappointments all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble familys dailylife
There are no words to describe the fascination the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page the gardenscenes which get names in the form of short poems not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems probably inspired by this Chinese tradition
Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of  years ago including their costumes their habits burying faded flowers crying over them can there be anything more touching and charming their political plots the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor the differences between the masters and the servants their foods their sicknesses and cures
You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens full of artificial mountains brooks bridges and of course exotic trees and flowers you breathe the typical scents get acquainted with their daily life the ranks of importance inside the family the old widowed grandmother being like their queen entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane..
the strict rules of courtship and marriage their strange illnesses and remedies
Moreover since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses the other world mixes invariably with this life and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds
Just like Shakespeare this author too brings ghosts Gods magic spells and items into the plots making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth feasting on both interchangeably
Then come the intricate plots many of them interwoven in each other each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style people living and dying for jealousy envy greed treachery chastity love not unlike Romeo and Juliet not Italian but Chinese
This book is simply unique a marvel of beauty tragedies exultations all discovered on each page
Maybe I should simply say that its the most beautiful book Ive ever read
Mind you I have nothing to do with China so I am impartial
Recommended with  stars out of  EnjoyBy the way its been one of the  bestsellers of all times
So Im not alone
Join the Redists as the admirers of this book are officially called...
Youll find in it surprises of all kinds youve never dreamt of
I found that it was difficult to follow in spite of being very motivated
It may be a cultural thing so I am going to try to donate it to the the Asian history department of my local university.
This is a wonderful translation
I have read both the Hawkes before and though it is said to be more poetic he also takes far more license to create his desired effects
This translation is far more faithful to the original and allows more of the multidimensional layers from the original to come out.
Present Chinese culture rests on seven pillars
One of these is the sayings of Kung Fu Tse the others are found embodied in the Four Classics of which this is one
An easy read an easy interpretation
Highly recommend for any traveler and those who want to understand our Oriental Neighbor.
I love this story I have read several different translated versions and this one seems to cover the most in a very condensed paper back
The Original book is over  pages I think and that is before the follow up author took it upon himself to finish the  original unfinished work
Les put it this way there are several movies the most recent with English sub titles is  episodes each an hour and a half long
Perfect
This is the story of a great Chinese family in decline
 It is told mainly through the lives of the women and servants of the family and a boy who loved the company of the maids who surround him
 The attention to every domestic detail is delightful
 I think the story takes place in the th century
 I dont think it can be read in a hurry
 One needs to be alert while reading so it is not a bedtime book
Allow a year or so to enjoy it
 I return to it again and again.
Not a good translation and hard to follow
I wish the translation was better into what is a classic book with many meanings.
This Chinese classic still has the power to surprise and delight
 This edition has good footnotes and good translation and nice illustrations though there are some typos and the print is smaller than Id like
 I bought it used and it was in very good condition.
I HEARD OF THIS CHINESE CLASSIC OF LITERATURE AND WAS ABLE TO ENJOY SOME SCENES FROM THE STORY WHEN I VISITED BEIJING CHINA AND GOT TO VIEW A MAGNIFICENT SCREEN CONTAINING  PANELS CONSTRUCTED FOR THE EMPEROR AND CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY AT THE SUMMER PALACE IN NORTHWEST BEIJING
THE SCREEN WAS CREATED FROM PRECIOUS AND SEMIPRECIOUS MATERIALS AND STANDS  METERS TALL
EVERY PANEL IS STRIKING IN APPEARANCE AND CONVINCED ME TO READ THE TRANSLATED VERSION OF THE STORY BECAUSE OF THE DEDICATION OF ALL OF THE ARTISANS THAT CREATED SUCH AN IMPORTANT DEPICTION OF THE CLASSIC STORY.
Good
Totally engrossing
 The reader becomes enmeshed in the family and their day to day events
A great read
 Reads like a diary.
Was given as a Christmas gift to my mother in law
 She was very happy with the set.
I have this version as well as the one by the name The Story of the Stone translated by David Hawkes
I prefer this version over the other because it is straight to the point and for some reason I am able to enjoy and visualize the story better
The other book does have nice prose
However it can feel like its dragging on.
good book long on some chapter lots of explain but still good
gift
it is good present for sb want to read this book
Not a great translation
This book is like Anna Karenina in the following ways Both are masterpieces of epic proportions
Both are considered contenders for being the greatest works of fiction in their respective languages
Both deal with large upper class families and the lifestyle and intrigue involved
Both are works of realism and paint a complete picture of a society
A Dream of Red Mansions focuses on the love between Baoyu an unusual child in his early teens who is temperamental and spends most of his time with the girls in the family mansion and Daiyu a delicate sensitive and yet witty and extremely clever girl
The two grow up as children and live in the same mansion but the family does not hurry to marry them off as they have other plans for Baoyu
This is the main thread that runs through the novels amazing  chapters
The other sublots are very numerous  there are hundreds  but none of them are sustained for the whole book
The main part of the book is the set of characters
Again there are hundreds but a few main ones which become the most interesting in this drama
Theres the conniving Xifeng Baoyus strict father Baoyus assertive other love Baochai and the like
Unlike Anna Karenina this book is full of humour jokes and poems which was where I think the translation failed the most as Chinese poetry rendered into English seems to lose the plot
It contains moments of great sadness but also wit and quirkiness
Theres been controversy with the amazon reviews of this particular translation
I dont speak Chinese so cant judge it but reading the text it seemed fine
I guess if I saw another or the original it would change my mind but this one isnt too bad
The novel deals with so many topics that you really get an overview of what life in th century upper class urban China was about
It is VERY long but its amazing how in relating heaps and heaps of seemingly trivial incidents you grow to love many of the characters
Its like most novels are like meeting someone and hence only seeing what they want to show while this novel is like living with them
And trivialities aside its very moving
A must for all interested in Chinese society or who dont mind persevering through  pages to read a one of the worlds unusual and amazing dynasty chronicles and love stories.
There are two complete unabridged translation of the greatest Chinese classical novel of manners Dream of the Red Chamber
 One is the Penguin classics version translated by Oxford doyen David Hawkes and his soninlaw John Minford now available on paperbacks in  volumes under the alternate title The Story of the Stone
 The other is this China Foreign Language Press version made in the late s by Chinese translators Yang Xianyi and his wife Gladys
With all due respects to the Yangs their translation just isnt on par with the Penguins
 The original novel is a paragon of how the classical vernacular Chinese language should be written Yangs version is stodgy and halfhearted and captures none of the elegance and depth of the original
 Their English borders on paraphrase at times and they dont appear to bother about stylistic recreation eg
some sentences dont sound native at all  The arrival of the edict rejoiced the hearts of all officials
 Believe me reading the original is much much better
The Yangs works could be serviceable as in their decent Lu Hsun but this version of Dream of the Red Mansions is embarassingly outclassed by a far superior and more idiomatic rendition David Hawkess version is simply unparalleled and a labor of love
Given a choice between the two translations its a nobrainer the Penguin is the winner anytime.
The Debt of Tears refers to Lin Daiyus plaintive obdurate settlement of her debt with fate and her surrender to lonely circumstances of death
Events in this despondent installment afford layers in increasing intensity of poignancy that presage Lin Daiyus death and Baoyus erroneous marriage to Baochai at the insistence of the Jias
The volume begins with an ailing Lin Daiyu dreaming a bad dream that confronts her pentup fear and fevered mind
Like a rope on a pulley Daiyus hopes and fears spin up and down with sighs and tears
Her health takes a huge toll and deteriorates drastically
The critical nature of her condition both alarms and frightens the maids who for fear of Baoyus lapsing into delirium decides to conceal from him
While Daiyu harbors an acute sense of insecurity being an outsider in the Jias mansion and broods about being at the mercy of the Jias the family deliberately reconsiders the auspicious match between jade and the golden locket
Baochai is crowned with praise for having the aplomb of someone twice her age
Her virtuous disposition finds favor in the eyes of all the ladyships
As the Jias frantically prepare for the wedding without Daiyus knowing the delicate frowner happens to eavesdrop the news and plunges into utter mortification
The prophecy contained in her nightmare is to be duly fulfilled after all
Bitterness and grief overwhelm her to the point that she conceives the only way to escape is death
She is determined to undermine her health and seizes her fate
The marriage between Baoyu and Baochai is an unfortunate mistake
It is an unexpected outcome of an incidence that should have otherwise favored Daiyu and spared her death
The sudden disappearance of Baoyus jade ponders Daiyu nullifies the bond of gold and jade
But little does Daiyu realize that the loss of the jade on which Baoyus life hinges causes the Jias to panic
The family resorts to hurry the wedding between Baoyu and Baochai to turn Baoyus luck and rally his spirits
This paradox of the lost jade expounds the mysterious vagaries of destiny the joy and pathos of life
Over the top of the hurlyburly of the Jias family life there hangs the consistent reminder of some transcendental existence
Somehow the cycle of life is totally out of our calculation and grip
The wheel of karma is what inevitably governs the cycle of life and the human soul is only playing out a predetermined role
Life doesnt end at death for death is merely dispersion
The bitter end of the tragic story of love between Baoyu and Daiyu throws the former into a delirium
What follows would be a significant theme Cao Xueqin intends for the novel elements that take on a greater emphasis than ever after Daiyus death Baoyus enlightenment and disenchantment the seeing through of red lust and finally the abjuring of the world.
FYI here is the review I posted on Amazon.com review for the Kindle edition of this same unabridged work httpwww.amazon.comDreamMansionCompleteUnexpurgatedebookproductreviewsBXOSArefcmcrdpseeallbtmieUTFshowViewpointssortBybySubmissionDateDescending Its by the same translator.
One of the great classics of world literature
Having read both this translation and the David Hawkes five volume translation of this novel I personally prefer this one
Although the David Hawkes translation is smoother and more literary for the English speaking reader I find that the Yang translation better conveys the atmosphere of th and th century China and the complex relationships between the various members of the upper class Chia household and their omnipresent bevy of slaves and servants
I even greatly enjoyed from a tongueincheek perspective the sayings of Chairman Mao inspired introduction to this translation
Im now ready to embark on my fourth reading of this book in about as many years.
Even though some may say that the translation is less then brilliant I still enjoyed the story very much
I was quiet sad actually when the story ended
It made me feel like no other book had ever made me feel
Ive always cheered on the good guys like in Outlaws of the Marsh or The Three Kingdoms but this time I really cared about these characters
Shakespeares got nothing on this story
The charcters expressed the way they felt through poetry and music
I was in the room and I knew these people
It accomplishes everything every other story never could
Im just afraid Ill never have that same feeling again.
I searched out this set because my teacher of Chinese medicine had told me that it was her favorite book as a teenager and that she still had the fondest memories of it  yet she had never read it in English
 When I gave it to her she beamed opened to a random page and said I know right where they are in the story although my English doesnt understand every word
 When I saw her later she told me that her daughter was upset that she hadnt thought of this book for her mom as it brought her so much happiness
This is book tells the story of a clan which is in the rundown
It is centered in a young man Baoyu and all his sisters
Dont expect a story in the traditional point of view I mean like greeks said an introduction a development and an end
This does not follow this trend well one could say that it sort of has an introduction and an end as a matter of fact but this book must be read as is just daily life in the Rong and Ning mansions
Do not expect either a very deep story or characters it is kind of superficial in fact although there a lot of characters and their whereabouts and machinations are told
It gives an insight though into what might have been the life in that land and in that time keep in mind though that this still a book
An overall enjoyable piece.
Love the tale compared to the other translation OK but perhaps the other one is better
First thought THE POETRY RHYMES OMG Second thought Not the best story line so far but when youre only on the first volume you cant really assume much can you Overall Worth reading and so far is the BEST translation.
If you want to know the history of Qing dynasty of China read it If you want to learn decent Chinese you must read it If you want to enjoy the great Chinese culture you defenitely must read it The translation is also the best one I have ever seen
But if you try to read the original Chinese editionmaybe you will be more agreed on what I recommended.
i have not read a different translation of this book by a different translator
this is not a typical review but a comment about the method of translation pinyin
and i with difficulty have not finished reading
heres why if you are an english speaking person or english educated you will have difficulty in pronouncing chinese names of places and people romanized by the pinyin method
the pinyin method is only immediatelyinstinctively useable for the chinese speakingreading person tongued with foreknowledge
to a nonchinese speakingreading person pinyin is pinyinhell
because you never know how to say it in  or  different ways
even if you have heard how one pinyin name is correctly pronounced you are still guessing when you come across names spelt similarly
then for the uninitiated there is hope to be found in a set of pinyin rules over   oh joy where by one can amuse oneself with repetitively before embarking on reading pinyin books
these rules are quite unnatural or to put in kindly  foreign  to the englishspeaking tongue
here are a few taken from the web q  Consonant ch as in  cheek u  Vowels oo as in  too ue  Diphthong as i in  ship ui  Diphthong pronounced as  wee v  Consonant used only to pronounce foreign words  The Chinese have great difficulty pronouncing the V
w  Consonant as in  want x  Consonants sh as in  she y  Consonant as in  yet z  Consonant as in  zero zh  Consonant j as in  jump most pinyintranslations do not provide such a list of rules or coach readers in this matter or explain how it is suppose to work
again from the web Putonghua mandrin  the national dialect has four tones
The Cantonese dialect has the most with nine
In the four tones of putonghua  the word ma The first tone flat ma in means mother
The second tone rising ma can mean numb or hemp
The third tone ma the voice dips and then rises means horse
The fourth tone ma starts high and falls abruptly means to scold
did that clarify the rules or compounded the difficulty frustrations runs high and runs often
everytime a pinyin name comes up i cringe which is like every other sentence
for the casual reader how close or by what degree it agree with the original language is hardly the key to successful reading or its enjoyment
if you seriously want to learn all the subtle tones i suggest you take up mandrin reading and writing  and then find the original version and enjoy that
...and read Story of the Stone
And this is about upperclass life not Exposing social evils the book cries out denunciation against the feudal system.
excellant
Terrible....too literal a translation...incomprhensible and loses its beauty
great set arrived promptly no probs
Roger Ames and Henry Rosemont offer a new translation of this Chinese classic of Confucius
 While I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy or integrity of the translation Ames and Rosemont have explained and offered justifications for their translations quite thoroughly
 The result is an informative version of this classic text attributed to Confucius
 Heavily discussing the ethics of ritual propriety and the need to be a junzi or exemplary person Confucius believed in wisdom and the law of reciprocity the silver rule
 Clearly he was concerned with preserving a moral tradition extracted from the collective understanding of the past
 While parts of Ames and Rosemonts introduction are tedious and could be better written overall they have made a valuable contribution to the understanding of Confucian thought.
There are some real nuggets
Broken up into many small entries although it doesnt help continuity it is perfect when you are waiting for a meeting to start
A difficult read but the ability to look up words right in the document is very helpful.
I cant comment on the translation as this is not my field
Reviewing from Joe Schmoes point of view
Ames provides historical context and  constructs a framework at the beginning of the book with which to think about Confuciuss teachings
The framework is applied consistently throughout this book making it not only a much more enjoyable read but one where the meaning of translation comes to life
I am very thankful that Ames wrote this book as it has allowed me a glimpse into my heritage.
Easy to comprehend captivating informative
 Everyone should read this translation
Everyone should read this book
I recommend taking notes in the sides of the pages to look back at later and also to see how your views change as you move along in the book and think more and more
The chapters on the culturallinguistic problems involved in translating Classical Chinese texts and whether the Chinese ever produced philosophy are more than worth the price of this book
Puruse the sayings of the Master carefully with close attention to the invaluable notes and a different world is opened
This is philosophy Jim
 But not as we know it.
Just as described.
Excellent
The wisdom and patience in which Confucius analyzed each and every situation was very appealing to me
It causes one to reflect on every situation before acting or dismissing any topic that may be encountered.
What an excellent resource for Asian studies in general
 The translation is great to compare with Lau et al
And the other material sheds light on previous interpretations of the text and context.
If you are a University of Hawaii student studying Chinese or Philosophy you will be reading this
 Be aware that while Ames has done a lot of great work in Chinese Philosophy he is really doing th century postmodernism on a Chinese background
 After reading this one might think that Confucius belongs to the same school as Derrida Foucault and Rorty
 That is as absurd as it gets
But academics do not make a name for themselves being correct outside of the hard sciences that is
 If they were correct they would simply answer questions in a way that satisfactory to readers and move on to the harder questions
 Instead they rise to the top of their fields by being wrong in the cleverest way imaginable and that is what Ames has done
 So a generation of American students and scholars are being taught that Confucius would be right at home with some s style sophistry
 It is actually kind of funny now that I think about it
 I guess when you start with the premise that truth is a social construct you can believe anything.
I like having this book around to study from on occasion
 A lot of books dont include any Chinese language aspects so I chose this one for that purpose
 Confucius is definitely open to interpretation so taking the time to study the principles is a must if you are interested in it.
its cool.
Great
Great book.
Potential buyers of the Kindle edition should be aware that I could only read the first page of the bibliography on my Kindle   a pretty serious shortcoming for a scholarly book  though all of it is readable on a KindleforPC application
The content of the book is firstrate
I have several works in this series and although I may not always agree I do always appreciate the integrity and the overall quality of the scholarship
Based on content this would be a fivestar review but you have to call attention to the serious failings of the publisher somehow and a bad review is the only way I know to do it.
Great book I will be reading this again in the future.
I needed this book for class and it arrived fairly quickly and the condition of the book was just as described
I was very pleased.
this is a biik it has words which mean things when you look at them in order it is referred to as reading some enjoy it Im somewhat undecided on the whole idea of the thing but hey your call
Ir ms good
This book consists of an introduction a translation and an appendix
The introduction gives an historical and textual background and outlines the philosophical approach of the authors
The appendix has some further remarks about a new version of the Analects found in a Han tomb in  and more ruminations about Chinese language and philosophy
When I bought this book I was a bit skeptical about the subtitle A Philosophical Translation  What kind of hybrid monster would that be What would made a translation philosophical Is this like saying a deep translation or an insightful translation And what does this choice of subtitle mean for other translations on the market Are they now by contrast all unphilosophical But..
I decided to give the writers the benefit of the doubt and see what they had to say
Unfortunately after reading the philosophical introduction I came away sorely disappointed and almost disgusted by the intellectual laziness and sloppiness of the writers
Instead of two people trying to think through the real issues that Confucius addresses issues that are interesting either because they are completely out of date merely of historical interest or because they still may be relevant for people today whatever their cultural background I find two muddleheaded academicians spouting nonsense about the basically substantive and essentialistic nature of the English language sometimes generalized to all IndoEuropean languages versus the more eventful relational nature of the Chinese language
If you just squint your eyes a bit and pretend to sort of vaguely understand what that might mean and consider the evidence for this view you find mostly smoke pipe dreams the halfdigested remains of past metaphysical discussions
You find stupid plain falsehoods like the claim that all IndoEuropean languages have articles
You find a severely misleading account of Chinese grammar  underlining the supposed ambiguity and vagueness of written Chinese
You find arguments like The very expression thing ..
 dongxi  literally eastwest  is a nonsubtantial relationship
 Deep The book could I suppose still be saved by the translation
Unfortunately philosophy gets in the way and leads the writers to use some very awkward new terms like the authoritative person for ren
The writers are aware of the awkwardness and try to justify their selections of certain key terms  which is good  but mostly I found their arguments again unconvincing and disappointing
The arguments are often either circular or strawman arguments
All in all I didnt find special merit in this translation compared to earlier translations by others
The language often seems clumsy without need
Especially clumsy if you know enough classical Chinese to see that the original is pretty straightforward and seems very natural
As an example here is the first paragraph of the first book The Master said Having studied to then repeatedly apply what you have learned  is this not a source of pleasure To have friends come from distant quarters  is this not a source of enjoyment To go unacknowledged by others without harboring frustration  is this not the mark of an exemplary person Having studied to then repeatedly  thats in my eyes just clunky and wooden
a source of  the original merely has is this not pleasant
Compare this with the old Legge translation  The Master said Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters Is he not a man of complete virtue who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him The last line in Legges translation is quaint  after all this translation is more than a  years old but the first two lines sound more natural to me
Ames and Rosemont claim that junzi doesnt have a gender basis so would probably object to a man of but that seems nonsense to me women are hardly even mentioned in the Analects and from a purely linguistic standpoint I also doubt that their claim is true.
Background Over a couple of decades time I planned to read the scriptures of the worlds great religionsphilosophies
I started with my own reading the Bible in two different translations first the HebrewGreek Word Study Bible by Spiros Zodhiates and then the NIV
Next I turned to Islam and AlQuaran
After that The Bhagavad Gita and the Analects of Confucius
Every reading is helping me go a bit deeper and wider into mans search for God and through that meaning in this life
More books and reviews to come
I read this book on a beach vacation a few years ago
I enjoyed it very much
Id not read much previously about Confucius or Confucianism the ethical and philosophical system derived from the mans teachings this volume filled that void
The book consists of a lengthy Introduction pages
The Analects are then presented in  books the Chinese text is presented alongside the English translation
Appendices take up the remainder
What I enjoyed most about this book was the Introduction
The authors go to great lengths to explain the times that Confucius  BC lived inthe government the politics the family structureand the language of classical Chinese
This is most important to understanding a people their culture and what and why they believe what they believe and how they build their civilization
We in the West know that the Orient is different the authors gave me a better understanding of why
For example in classical Chinese there are no words as there are in English foramong othersfreedom liberty choice individual reason autonomy
The authors write None of these English words has a close analogue in classical Chinese...
p

Let that sink in
I mean really sink in
Freedom
Liberty
Choice
Individual
Reason
Autonomy
If you dont have a word to describe something then that something simply and correctly does not exist for you
Frightening and eyeopening all at once....
So for me the Introduction and the insight it provided into Chinese language and thus fundamentally Chinese thinking was worth the price of the book
The Analects themselves are stories of Confucius wanderings in the countryside and his sayings on what he thinks is best for proper government from the emperor down to local rulers down to relations among family
Thats about it
But it provides great insight into Chinese thinking
The text at times is rather dry and straightforward
Dont expect Confucius say...
nonsense
It doesnt exist
Read this book for the great introduction it is to one of the worlds great and largest philosophical some would say religious systems
And also for the keen insight it provides into the Chinese people and why things are the way they are
Whats past is prologue
Sept
  note The SeptemberOctober  issue of Foreign Affairs has a short review of the recently published book An Anatomy of Chinese Rhythm Metaphor Politics by Perry Link
The first sentence of the review Link focuses on how Chinese syntax is to a great extent ordered by speech and sound and not by the kind of grammatical logic at work in many Western languages
He scrutinizes the ways in which certain Chinese words take on metaphoric meanings
The book has a price tag of 
but if youre interested in the topic it sounds like a necessary book.
Confucius has been much maligned since he is perceived as wanting a static rigid society
This translation attempts to show that that is not really true
The translators and editors explain in the foreword that the Chinese language is dynamic and therefore Confucius sayings does not reflect a static society but rather a society in a constant flux
It does come out that Confucius will not tolerate revolution but he does accept evolution
He is not preaching a static society but rather that all development should build on the previous
While he stresses the importance of ritual he also hammers in that ritual must be combined with warmth caring and even humour
A more gentle less rigid Confucius appears in this translation
Lastly I think Confucianism relates to Daoism as Shaolin relates to tai chi or Bruce Lee to Yang Cheng Fu on is concerned with the external and one with the internal
It is just a matter of which way you chose
Ones you have achieved mastery there is no difference.
This is a nicely presented book containing over  pages
The graphics are well done cover and layout of the text within including the chinese original phrases for those reading Mandarin
Theres a lot of footnotes in the back stimulating further research and backing up the interpretations contained within as well as an appendix with more material that is intended to add context to Confucius outlook on societal relationships and behavioral beliefs
Next I had to admit that each page has different scenarios of interaction among people or philosophical reflections such  that for some this book is a cure for insomnia no doubt
The fact that Europeans and North Americans have not been taught to read the Chinese alphabet or the language further beckons understanding
Also the  page introduction to the Analects is surely relevant as the author justifies himself of some choices in terminology as compared to other translations and the works of previous tranlators
A read here on Amazon didnt understand how an archeological find could bring higher understanding of these classics from Ancient China
Well the answer resides in the manuscripts
Much like the Holy Bible was discovered in several languages Greek and also nearHebraic languages for example the meaning of the texts and the final translation will depend a lot on on the ability of the underlying language to express human thought and the scholars ability to read it understand it interpret it and translate it for English speakers no doubt
For  and change this is a not a bad work to own.
This translation questions the traditional translations of Confucius  ideas
Ren usually translated as humanity here  becomes authoritative conduct which is closer to Confucius  original meaning of the word which was noble conduct
Another  unique feature of the translation is that the key Chinese characters are  highlighted as they appear directly in the English translation
This is  probably not the first choice for someone unfamiliar with the Analects  because it is somewhat technical but its a must if you are looking for a  deeper understanding of the classic.
The only translation that is a pleasure to read for both its language and its profundity
 Ames and Rosemont bury the stodgy old Confucius and introduce us to a vibrant thinkerthe kind of intellectual magnet that  attracted hundreds of followers in his own time and millions throughout  history
 Although their choice of translation for key Confucian  terms may seem unorthodox consider where our orthodox translations have  come from
They have come from translators with a knowledge of the  Classical Chinese language but all of the built in presuppositions of  Western Christian and essentialistic thinking including surprisingly  D.C
Lau
 Since the standard translations Legge Waley Lau there have  been great strides in understanding the philosophy of Confucius time
 Ames and Rosemont are not only experts in the language but are at the  cutting edge of ancient Chinese philosophy
 This book questions many basic  presumptions about Confucius philosophy and deserves thoughtful  consideration.
Daomonkeys reviews exhibit detailed knowledge in Chinese philosophy and I agree with many of his criticisms
But he has made a small error in his review of this book which is important to note
This book is NOT by Hall and Ames and thus does not show the proclivity towards pragmatization that runs throughout their stimulating work
Rather it is by Ames and ROSEMONT a philosopher who has published extensively on topics in Chinese philosophy
You will find little by way of speculative acrobatics and obsolete wheedlings here
The unconventional nature of the translation may seem awkward at first but repays careful reading Ames and Rosemont provide good arguments in the introduction for adopting them
Also the translation by Slingerland he mentions published by Hackett is indeed a fine translation with much running commentary.
I got to know this book thanks to my English teacher who studied while he was at Hawaii under Mr.Ames
The introduction part of this book is very compact it is full of insights about the development and formation of Eastern philosophy and also about how Eastern and Western philosophies tend to focus on different values
What the authors had continuously stressed throughout the introduction  that they translated this book by considering the uniqueness or difference that Chinese language and culture have  is indeed permeated through the whole book making it more faithful to the original than ever
The book was notwithstanding that the analects is such a classic engaging and interesting
As an Asian myself I could explore further into my personal interest in EasternWestern comparitive philosophy together with refreshing yet faithful translation of Lun yu
The authors acknowledge the vagaries of translation then fall victim to them
Overwordy inconsistent and sometimes just plain sloppy
Translates ren as authoritative which is about the most  misleading choice Ive ever seen
The notes and discussion however are  quite good and the original Chinese text is included
Pinyin romanization.
The philosophy of Confucius is nothing like todays analytic philosophy
Confucius using the common language of those around him spoke about the maintenance of rites and the importance of tradition
He did not write anything himself because he was busy trying to push his disciples to get up and follow his example
He provides the deepest insight to his readers when he is most cryptic
Attempting to translate this into modern English at all is a difficult task as the authors acknowledge
They claim that they want to aim for painstaking accuracy explaining what they know about ancient Chinese society
And then they go off the deep end
Confucius speaks of carrying out the will of Heaven
The authors claiming that Heaven is a JudeoChristian concept leave this untranslated as tian as if we were dealing with something as complex as Heideggers Dasein
Confucius was never trying to be complex or inscrutable  he was trying to smack down the glibtongued sophists of his day and encourage virtuous behavior
Except these translators dont believe that ancient China had a concept of virtue instead translating the single word ren as the impressivesounding authoritative conduct
Every mealymouthed replacement of a simple commandment with an obscure philosophical hypothesis distances the reader from the text and accomplishes the opposite of what the authors of the Analects were aiming for
This exact sort of behavior was ridiculed by Confucius in verse 
but you wouldnt know it from the translation
Their version Confucius said to Zi Xia You want to become the kind of counselor who is an exemplary person not the kind that is a petty person
Very philosophical
My version Confucius said to Zi Xia Kid being a Confucian means being a gentleman not being a scholar
This translation to put it unpleasantly attempts to shove Western philosophy into Confucius mouth
UPDATE I am eager to announce I have finally found a translation of the Analects that meets my needs
My lengthy review can be found on its page
This book is AMAZING  If you really want to focus on an Eastern Philosophy have time to focus  try extreme to learn This book will Change YoU
Much more interesting than I had anticipated with a careful study of the rules that make up the fabric of an ordered society
Its not his fault that the interpretation became too rigid
as  happens.
how can I review this it is what it is a classic of Oriental philosophy
Even if you prefer Daoism this is still worth a read.
I wish I had shelled out a few extra dollars and bought this excellent translation in hard copy This bilingual edition includes the original Chinese text traditional characters but the visual appearance of the characters is ruined in the kindle edition by extremely offputting graininess and pixelation
Unless the Chinese text is of no interest to you at all you should buy the paper version
So disappointing
The more simple characters such as  and so on are readable albeit ugly but more intricate characters such as  just look like squarish blobs
Worse increasing the text size makes no difference to the Chinese characters which are apparently some kind of low resolution graphic inset and so you cant blow them up to the point where you can make them out
Moreover the fixed size of each piece of Chinese text varies from passage to passage so some short passages have huge but grainy characters while others have small and eyestraininducing ones
And thats not all  thee are a few typos in the translation itself especially in the phonetic romanisation of Chinese terms
Dont rely on the text of this kindle edition if you are citing it in an essay Do your eyes a favour and buy the real book.
Great book
I was able to find it on Amazon after it was mentioned in the Art of War
As soon as I realized I wanted it....BOOM...it was in my hands in no time  stars on this one.
The printing job on this book is atrocious
 It is completely shifted upwards making it awkward to read.
Perfect
Comme  son habitude la traduction de Ames est remarquable  la fois classique dans son approche gnrale et trs au courant des dcouvertes archologiques
Il sagit l dune traduction rellement philosophique.

Analects in case you were wondering are selected passages from the writings of an author
I mention this definition here because it seems that the only time we use the term analects is when we consider the writings of Confucius
Was there once a larger corpus of writings from Confucius and is what we have today distilled from some larger body of work If so then I wish we had that entire larger body of philosophical work the same way we have a good many books from classical Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle but that being said I certainly am glad that we have the Analects as a distillation of Confucius philosophy
His Chinese name was Kung Futzu  and the Latinate name that he bears today was probably bestowed by Jesuit missionaries to China in the th century
By any name however Confucius is a great philosopher who speaks to us today just as clearly as he spoke to the people of Chinese antiquity
He lived a long time ago  when he died in  B.C
the Spartan defense of Thermopylae had taken place just one year before  but it is astonishing how current and relevant his words and ideas remain
Analects is of course a Latin and Greekderived term in Chinese the book is the Lun Y
It is divided into  books and contains a total of  Confucian sayings most of them quite short
On this rereading of The Analects I encountered some sayings that were already familiar to me e.g
To say you know when you know and to say you do not when you do not that is knowledge II
p

Yet on this reading I learned many things that I found new
Perhaps because Ive been reading a good deal of classical Greek philosophy lately I found some striking parallels between Confucius and the Greeks who wrote sometime after him
For instance when The Master said Barbarian tribes with their rulers are inferior to Chinese states without them III
p
 it made me think of how the ancient Greeks considered any nonGreekspeaking society to be  barbaroi barbarians
I found myself thinking of the doomed tragic heroes of ancient Greek drama men and women brought down by their tragic flaws when I heard Confucius reflect that In his errors a man is true to type
Observe the errors and you will know the man IV
p

Confucius knows that his disciples aspire to government service in the bureaucracy of the Empire  hence the prevalence of sayings in which Columbus offers advice such as Do not worry because you have no official position
Worry about your qualifications
Do not worry because no one appreciates your abilities
Seek to be worthy of appreciation IV
p
 Additionally in an acutely statusconscious society Confucius listeners are very interested in what will help them achieve the distinction of gentleman
With considerable focus on the value of benevolence Confucius suggests that The gentleman understands what is moral
The small man understands what is profitable IV
p

And in one of my favorite passages from the Analects Confucius remarks that the gentleman hates to dwell downstream for it is there that all that is sordid in the Empire finds its way XIX
p

Readers who are interested in the JudeoChristian philosophical and moral tradition may be struck by the ways in which Confucius disagrees with one of the primary moral imperatives of Christianity
In contrast with Lao Tzu who in the Tao Te Ching tells his disciples to do good to him who has done you an injury Confucius says What then do you repay a good turn with You repay an injury with straightness but you repay a good turn with a good turn XIV
p

In other words the only thing you owe to someone who has wronged you is straightness directness honesty
For Western readers many of whom have been raised in the tradition of whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also Matthew  this may be the most challenging passage in the entire Analects
At the same time Confucianism invokes the Golden Rule in a way similar to all the other great moral philosophical and religious systems of the world
In response to a disciples asking Is there a single word which can be a guide to conduct throughout ones life Confucius replies Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire XV
p

Perhaps because it is the dawn of a presidential election year here in the United States of America I found that I was particularly interested in one particular example of Confucius advice to his disciples Be sure to go carefully into the case of the man who is disliked by the multitude
Be sure to go carefully into the case of the man who is liked by the multitude XV
p

Good advice in the state of Lu during the Zhou dynasty and good advice in any modern nation nowadays
I had this edition of The Analects with me when my wife and I were traveling in Beijing home of the second largest Confucian temple in the world
Walking in the Forbidden City my copy of The Analects in my jacket pocket I wondered how many readers imperial or otherwise referred to their own copy of this book while traveling between and among the buildings of this most impressive citywithinacity
This edition of The Analects includes a glossary of names and places mentioned in the book an appendix on events in the life of Confucius a textual history of the book and a chronology of Confucius life
Particularly helpful is another appendix one that describes the characters of the different disciples with whom Confucius speaks in the Analects
For readers of Confucius time and indeed for followers of Confucianism nowadays the differences in character among disciples like Tzukung Tzulu and Yen Yan would be as selfevident as the differences in personality that Christians see among Saint Peter Saint John and Saint Thomas in the New Testament
This Penguin Books edition of Confucius Analects is a very fine way to acquaint or reacquaint oneself with one of the most important books ever written.
I own the Oxford Worlds Classics edition translated by Raymond Dawson
This was my first reading of The Analects and while it was not quite what I expected as it does not contain a truly coherent philosophy or even a consistent mode of presentation or authorship it was nevertheless an incredibly rewarding study
And I say study rather than read because while it is quite brief  pages there are a wealth of chapters that will leave you ponderingin a good way If you are worried about the stereotype of vaguess and aloofness in Chinese sages you neednt fear The Analects
The main thing that can obscure some of the chapters is their reliance on Chinese history and most of these are briefly cleared up in Dawons notes
The Analects can be picked up and put down at a whim due to the informal structure and you will never feel that you lost the flow of it should a few days pass between readings
While I cant compare it to another translation or the Chinese I found Dawsons translation to be very smooth and highly consistent throughout and he supplements the introduction with helpful notes on his translation of key terms
This is an edition primarily for the newcomer rather than the scholar not to say it is in anyway dumbed down as it is wonderfully concise in its introduction and notes never saying more than needs to be said
However in my case I certainly wouldnt have minded more scholarship and context
Dawson uses Pinyin rather than WadeGiles which is a welcome shift in my eyes as WadeGiles often feels overwrought even if it sometimes comes closer to the true pronunciation and there is a nifty conversion chart included in this edition
This edition like all of the newer Oxford Worlds Classics is neatly designed with a beautiful cover and good quality paper.
Confucius  The Analects is a rather intriguing book since it aims to tackle information regarding the well known Confucius in a cogent manner
The book is laid out in a fairly straight forward approach with no frills thats an extremely quick read
Within the introductory section there is some background material featured while a tad later on the book features notes on particular translations that the book offers
 Knowing how complex translations can be its a wellthought out approach to delineate what the book means by each translated term instead of assuming that the reader will know
 Not only that but also certain words have various meanings so to be able to narrow down with precision what was stated is greatly appreciated
For individuals seeking veritable gems of Confucius this book has dozens of them
Reading this book will certainly help the individual realize how the culture was at the time and why the information presented here was so vital to the upbringing and society in ancient China
The totality of the book is seamlessly interwoven to give you everything you need for comprehension while not an iota more
 This certainly helps since other books can be longwinded at times
Taking all into account the book definitely belongs in the libraries of individuals who value such knowledge with resounding depth
 Confucius was definitely a master of his craft and this book exemplifies that quite trenchantly.
I bought this version of the Analects together with Penguin Classics
I think this one is closer to the original text thus more paradoxical and sometimes baffling
Penguins is easier to read but unfortunately that means that some paradoxes are presolved an interpretation is already in place and part of the magic and wisdom lost
I think the best option is to read both the similarities and differences are enlightening
If you have to pick one my personal choice is OUP.
The Analects are widely recognized as one of the foundations of Chinese civilization
 Understanding them from a Western perspective is however difficult
There is simply no genre that the Analects fits into within the Western canon
 Add to this a wide panoply of characters who the neophyte will find it difficult to keep track of and the reader may be left with only remembering some of the more familiar adages of Confucius
This is not meant as a criticism of the text
 It is just that a casual perusal of the Analects is not possible in the same way that one could read for example Greek mythology
There are no gods and only oblique references to anything supernatural
Perhaps the practical nature of the text is one reason it has endured for over two thousand years
I am not trying to discourage anyone from reading the AnalectsI just think that a more complete scholarly guide than is present in the Oxford Classics edition may be necessary to truly appreciate the work
Casual readers will probably be most struck by the difference between the Analects and ancient Western legends and retain some of the sayings that have parallels in Western ethics
 Anything more demands much more engagement with the material.
The Analects touches on the most important and deepest problems of life selfmastery social relations government family and much more
Confucius urges us to follow the way to study and to observe the rites as a worthy way of life
 He doesnt promise that one who follows this way will be wealthy or happy or enlightened or saved but rather that such a life is still the best one can live as it is decorous and ennobling
 I hear in the Analects a precursor to Aristotles Nichomachean Ethics which advocates a life pursuing virtue with its attendant Golden Mean
Yet this is a very difficult book to follow because it presents no clear narrative and no obvious structure in our normal Western mode of Aristotelian definition division and classification
 Rather it is almost a streamofconsciousness collection of gnomic utterances from a variety of characters mostly Confucius presented with little in the way of context or chronology
 It works more by recursive themes juxtaposition and unexpected free association
So its kind of like the way we experience the reception of insight in real life which is one of the things that makes this a masterwork worthy of repeated study
 Indeed I think this book is only profitable if reread and reread I would say the same of Lao Tzu and the Bible
I find this Penguin edition to be a great choice for the first reading experience D.C
Laus introduction and notes give the firsttime reader enough context and background to read this work with some understanding and admiration but not so much as to impose an interpretation
 Please note that I do not read Chinese so I cannot judge the quality of the translation
I look forward to revisiting this little book again and again.
My interest in the Analects was to get a comparison between it and the Bible and the Koran The Analects was shorter than I expected
I had to scan a lot of  the masters advice to his students to get the underlying message which is the same in the Analects the Bible and the Koran  Do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself.
I wanted to read some of Confucius writings namely The Analects
What I got in this book was  pages of Chinese history  bios of some of the  disciples  timelines  The Analects
If youre an adult who can enjoy the brilliance of ageless thinking without someone else analyzing it for you ..
dont buy this book.
I feel like I should have paid more attention to the reviewers who felt just like I do
It seems to be rather boring in so many occasions
But I felt I had to read it personally
There are a lot of similarities in his teachings and the Classical Hellenic Philosophers
I wonder who learned from whom
But it does not matter
Teaching Ethics and Honorable Action by leaders is worthy to every one
Anyone listening today in Washington Please read it and i might help you
The Analects is a collection of aphorisms anecdotes and other snippets of instruction compiled by followers of Confucius around  years ago
There are no doubt many different versions and editions of The Analects in English translation
The one I am reviewing is the ebook edition from Open Road Media which is likely based on the public domain file of the James Legge translation from Project Gutenberg
There is no denying the importance of Confucius in Chinese history and Eastern philosophy but how does The Analects hold up as a reading experience for the st century reader To a Westerner like myself even if you habitually read philosophy it is difficult to just pick up a copy of The Analects and extract the wisdom contained within it
In form and structure the Western text that most closely resembles The Analects would likely be the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius
The Analects is divided into  books which are then divided into numerous chapters most of which are only a sentence or a paragraph long
Some chapters consist of a few brief numbered passages
Like the Meditations there is no discernible order to these chapters for the most part they just fall where they may
While each individual chapter can be studied for its own merits youd really have to develop an intimate knowledge of the book as a whole in order to understand all the connections between the various chapters and form a complete picture of Confucian thought
Though the teachings of Confucius form the basis for the Chinese religion of Confucianism the philosophy of Confucius is really a secular philosophy that concentrates on ethics and politics rather than any metaphysical worldview
Confuciuss teachings were intended as training for scholars wishing to enter public service and work their way up the bureaucratic ladder of government
He also however looks into broader issues of ethics interpersonal relations right living and personal happiness that may be relevant to anyones daily life
Some of the advice on governing may be applicable to the political and business worlds of today but Confuciuss emphasis on knowing ones place in the social strata is unlikely to be embraced by ambitious Western individualists
There are some similarities between The Analects and the stoicism of Marcus Aurelius in their advocation of resigning ones self to the reality of ones place in life
While the Stoic attitude might be simplistically summed up as You may be born a slave but no one can enslave your mind the Confucian view in a nutshell might be something more like If youre born a servant be the best servant you can be
Just as the first book of the Meditations refers to a number of ancient Roman personages that the average modern reader is unlikely to be familiar with The Analects is peppered with references to historical figures of Chinas ancient past
Such references are pervasive throughout The Analects to the point where youd really need a masters degree in Chinese history to figure out much of whats being alluded to
There are plenty of passages that clearly state a code of conduct for right living or list the admirable qualities of a superior man but these are interspersed between anecdotes of dukes government functionaries and students of the Master some of which seem to require prior knowledge of the characters mentioned
Whats a Westerner to make of such passages without detailed explanatory annotations There is relevant wisdom in The Analects if youre willing to dig for it but rather than reading the original text most readers would probably be better off consulting a textbook that explains the teachings of Confucius in an orderly and accessible manner.
This book is really insightful and contains all of Confucius teachings plus information on Confucious by the author which is really helpful to understand Confucius ideas
I ordered a used copy as it is more economic plus it had highlighted notes from the previous user which aided in spotting important phrases
Inexpensive way to review Confucius and hopefully get insights on China which was heavily influenced by this man
I note in his writings an emphasis on the individuals responsibility to his master boss spouse government etc.
Philosophically and morally sound advice from a historic writer
 This is one of many books on my lifetime reading list now complete.
One of the most famous philosophers in history is Confucius
 This text covers various quotes and conversations with Confucius and his  disciples
 Since many of the sayings are spoken in mystical parables and some of the thoughts might  be lost in translation it is not always clear what the message may be in many of these conversations
 Nevertheless this is an important text for anyone who is interested in the many wise sayings of Confucius

I bought this book as a gift for my boyfriend
I was iffy about buying it after reading the reviews but he loves it It is the real thing and he appreciates that fact
I havent read it myself but I looked through it and read a few quotations
I felt connected Confucius in a feelgood way.
Highly repetitive
I didnt feel like I got the character of Confucius
I was disappointed
Perhaps I should read a book about Confucius to find out more about his teachings.
This book was falling apart when I received it
I chose used because I have had very good luck in the past but this one should never have been sold.
Confucius
What can be said Hes a goto for psuedointellectuals wannabe philosophers and internet egotists
But all the pretentious stigma aside the Analects is a worthy read
If youre here to deconstruct morality youre reading the wrong book
Confucius was a man of objectivity and often refers to the superior man as one who upholds virtuous ideals exercises discipline and offers unwavering indiscriminate compassion and respect for his fellowman
That said his teachings read like a motivational book His verses on conduct and behavior are humbling and can contribute much to the one seeking selfimprovement.
Amazing book good gift for deep thinkers
Chinese Philosophy is one  you can apply to daily life even in the st century.
didnt cost more than a dollar and it shows
You truly get what you pay for  Kindle prices are going up and the cheap stuff is not worth it anymore.
Had a paper due in a week and received the items in time to use as a reference.
Confucius is too obsessed with rites and customs otherwise very astute about benevolence are primary in life.
Its one if top three books Ive read in my life
It has so much written in so little
Its a book you can fit in your pocket but its big enough to change your life D
The Oxford World Classics publication of The Analects is excellent with plenty of explanatory notes
 My sentiments lie with Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu but it is worthwhile to study Confucius as well.
Arrived on time and in immaculate condition.
Great read.
Great reference text.
Came in Excellent Condition
I was mostly interested in this version because it has a very beautiful and artistic cover I didnt want a version of the book with a plane cover
But aside from that its A Very Good Book
Knowledge Is Power

Was a gift for a friend
Good condition
other sources needed for cultural context
Good quality
I enjoy this a lot
It is so nice to pick it up  read a little and ponder the meanings
Great to have it
I leave this on the back of the toilet to confuse my roommates who constantly operate from a fearful mindset.
this man was a marvel it all boils down to do to other what you wish done to yourself
Too bad few people care to follow sage advice from those who came before us.
Helpful for a Religion Major tool
The Amazon review system for this book seems to think its some kind of novel
Hilarious considering that its wisdom literature
Well translated with a few good notes.
Good value.
This book is very disorganized and it is very difficult to glean the main ideas from it.
Pretty easy to make it through I have not read other translations but this one is understandable and a good read.
its good
excellent
Oxford did a phenomenal job in the organization of this historic work
Confucius is undoubtedly one of the most influential men to have walked the earth and The Analects is a work that all libraries should encompass
This book includes additional notes and insights and is a great size to carry around with you whether you desire some light reading are on the train to work or in a waiting room at the doctor
Well done Oxford
Hard to get into but a necessary source book for tracing what humans accept and what is not accepted and the breadth of an admonition across human experience.
The book arrived in perfect condition and is exactly what I thought I was buying
Just ensure you want this particular version of this famous piece and you cant go wrong.
The book itself is good
The book was damaged on arrival.
It was suppose to be brand new yet i got it folded and crumpled up.
Given to friends
 Necessary read.
Great
I just luv the flow And yes the conscious elevation as well Sincerely Terrence W.
Best edition
Great book condition
Confucius is worth reading for anyones first eastern philosophical literary experience.
This book needs to be checked for spelling
Surely Penguin can spring for a copy editor
Its pretty bad in spots
A smooth translation
I had never READ this classic before
If you are into finding out more about OTHER faith structures READ this.....it is illuminating
Just like any philosophy it is quite complex.
Great condition
Exactly as described.

How can we thrive without insights by the Sages of history
excellent reference book
Excellent.
great shopping.
Offers a distinguished perspective on the outlook of conducting ones self
Definitely recommendable it was indeed a worthy book to read.
Very interesting book
 You can read it in a night and enjoy it.
Perfect
The Analects are crucial to understanding the culture of China
For this reason we use it as an anchor text in our documentbased core course on the history of civilization
This edition is the most helpful I have seen
It is a good smooth translation and it is easily readable

Ok
good
Great book.
good
This is an incredible collection of teaching on wisdom and virtue two of the most important things in life by a man who spent his life studying them and passing them on to his disciples
 There is a great deal of truth to be found in these pages and whoever reads them is likely to come away a better person
Not the same as equivalent paper edition
No Chinese characters side by side  Will this electronic edition improve
Beautifully put together.
Alas not a very good translation of the old classic
The style is rather awkward only get if youre an enthusiast.
Excellent Fast shipping and product was exactly as described Would definitely buy from this seller again
good translation
good gift for english reading friends who want to know more about Chinese philosophy.
GOOOOOOD
A great book
Has all of Confuciuss principles in a nice tidy bundle
Short and easy to maneuver on Kindle.
A beautiful EasternOriental Classic of Philosophy and Religion.
excellent
Confucius is just full of sayings some I had heard some were new to me
 I have enjoyed reading this book and learned from it
 My question is  Who wrote all of the sayings down and then saved them  OK I looked my questions up and found that the Author was the Disciples of Confucius and they wrote this in the th century BC and was kept in a book called The Analects of Confucius
 Google has more answers
  Enjoy
Great gems for any reader.
Awesome its what I expected
Great teachings and learnings from a true man of wisdom and virtue
i was inspired by a college class to get this for further reading and i enjoyed this edition very much
it had an excellent translation.
Very well laid out.
My nephew has gone off to college this year and some of his books were so expensive we were lucky to find some of them here on Amazon and at a way better price than a retailer Very pleased with the books we were able to find
An excellent read which can provide valuable insight not only into ancient China but also modern day China
Excellent questions are asked and excellent answers are given everyone could learn a thing or two from this book
However due to the translation following who the message is aimed at Masters and students referring to one another or translations of common Chinese salutations etc can lead to some confusing moments.
Thanks
An interesting translation
I have found it important to read more than one translation because ChinesetoEnglish requires just that
Simple inflections change the meanings dramatically so this is one of several on my shelf.
I had to purchase the book for a college class but decided to keep it after it was used
 I enjoyed reading it and find early Asian philosophy interesting
 Sadly the book is difficult to read on the first go through and will require a couple readings and focus to get through it.
THE ANALECTS IS A GOOD BOOK FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND CONFUCIAN PHILOSOPHY
 THE TRANSLATION IS CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE EASY TO READ BUT IT DOESNT EXPLAIN WHAT EACH ANALECT MEANS AND BEGGINERS ON THE SUBJECT COULD MISUNDERSTAND THE MEANINGS
GREAT REFERENCE BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY KNOW CONFUCIANISM OR A LITTLE OF CHINESE HISTORY.
Great book Had a little damage to it though
Perhaps damaged en transit.
Boring as hell but sometimes it makes you think.
Item as described and fast shipping  recommended
I needed this book for a class
It came in great condition the printing is very clear on every page and there were no folds at all
The quality exceeded my expectations definitely worth its price
Great book Gives insight into deep thought and chinease culture
Highly recommend this book for people who want to expand their understanding of Confucius and the impact he had on China.
I gave this book a  because it didnt come in the cover I expect it to be in on the webpage
In addition the condition listed that it was very good but it was really a fair to me
Some of the pages in the pack were tearing
I bought this book for  but looking at the back when it was sold new it was listed for .
gift for my son
For school
I would very much recommend this book for college students who are in honors programs that require specific reading materials
The price on Amazon was less than half of what the book store was charging for the same book
Great deal
It contains the analects in confuciuss words and that is rare There were translations after and i really value the book
Way to go Oxford
An example of publishing at its worse
No attrubution of the translator no previous publication data no prefatory material no index none of Laus appendixes if indeed it is his trnalation
It is a piece of crap
The binding is chep the cover is the sort you find on cheap kids books
Caveat emptor
Great book.
ladsfladf
Unable to understand writing at all.
Returned ..
didnt realize new translation differed from work of which giftee asked.
Confucius says 
required reading for class
Product got here very quickly
 Book is in okay shape good enough for a read once or twice but not soemthing worth keeping as a reference tool or hierloom
 Has some pen marks and notes in it I dont mind
 Incredible cheap seller did a great job.
I do not accept Master Kongs logic or direction and in fact think it is a lot of noise
However it is worth serious study
I reject but many admire
 To study you need a very good edition
This is it
Brief blunt readily understandable
Much of the Masters work is fragmentary much is cut off
That is reality
Everyone should study the works of Master Kong however as the story of Chinese culture if fascinating and itself enlightening
Master Kong still controls much of the thinking of the present Communist Party of China
Decide for yourself about the merits of the philosophical teaching but this is an excellent book for study
Repeat much of the work is fragmentary.
I only bought this because it was required reading in a class and it was painfully boring to read
Im sure theres someone who would like it but I dont.
Thanks came in timely fashion needed it for class...perfect  was correct Its a good book  has a ton of great lessons to learn.
Not what I expected....
UGH
I did not read this book
 I ordered it for an out of state friend
 She wanted to read Confucious but I dont recall any feedback.
I found it very insightful but the way its written is very comprehensive
I found other Confucius books that were more of an easier read.
The Analects consists of passages compiled by the followers of Confucius containing many quotes attributed to Confucius together with comments from others about Confucius quotes from his disciples etc
Not being wellinformed about China circa  BC I found D
C
Laus accompanying introduction appendices and notes very helpful in understanding the main text
The Analects are rather disjointed with no overarching organizational thread running through the passages
They are also rather dry
They lack the poetic quality of say the Bhagavad Gita or the King James Bible at least in this translation
But I found the central ideas in the Analects very appealing and therefore liked the book considerably
Confucius thought that one should behave morally not in the hope of reward either in this life or any afterlife but because it is the right thing to do
He prized learning being benevolent being trustworthy in what one says
For instance the following quote by Confucius appears three times Make it your guiding principle to do your best for others and to be trustworthy in what you say
I also appreciate the sentiment that correct behavior changes over time which allows me to hope that had Confucius lived in modern times he would have had a more favorable attitude toward women who are barely mentioned in the Analects
Three more quotes of Confuciuss that I liked  When you make a mistake do not be afraid of mending your ways
 It is not the failure of others to appreciate your abilities that should trouble you but rather your failure to appreciate theirs
 If a man remembers what is right at the sight of profit is ready to lay down his life in the face of danger and does not forget sentiments he has repeated all his life even when he has been in straitened circumstances for a long time he may said to be a complete man.
The Analects contain twelve books I to XX each with around  to  numbered paragraphs
Confucius believed a leader that acted virtuously without resort to punishment could govern a country
Confucius lived in the hundred philosophers period  BC
Two other prominent philosophers in that period were Mo Tzu with Consequentialism see my review and Han Fei Tzu with Legalism see my review
 Many of Confucius ideas are similar to Mo Tzu be it with some important differences see later
The government never practiced Confucius ideas without including some of the ideas of Legalism which emphasized the establishment of laws and punishment
 I have read the analects several times and analyzed each paragraph for relevance and usefulness to day
Many are
I learned a lot
 Many authors have tried to group these paragraphs under a few headings some under the Chinese words Jen Chun tzu Li Te and Wen
The author presents in the Introduction such a summary of  pages of the  Analects text  pages
 My recommendation is to read the analects before the introduction and determine what you think is relevant to day
 Confucius presents ideas on how you should think and act
I  have selected a few of the paragraphs about government and the way to act that I hope  will encourage you to read the analects
 XII..Question
What would you think if I were to kill those who do not follow the way do what is right Answer What need is there for you to kill Just desire the good yourself and the common people will be good
The virtue of the gentleman is like wind the virtue of the small man is like grass
Let the wind blow over the grass and it is sure to bend
 II
Guide them with edicts keep them in line with punishments and the common people will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame
Guide them with virtue keep them in line with rites and they will besides having a sense of shame reform themselves  XVI
There are nine things the Gentleman turns his thought to seeing clearly when he uses his eyes to hearing acutely when he uses his ears to looking cordial when it comes to his countenance to appearing respectful when it comes to his demeanor to being conscientious when he speaks to be reverent when he performs his duties to seeking advice when he is in doubt be aware of the consequences when he is enraged and to do what is right at the sight of gain
  IV
The way of the master consists in doing ones best and in using oneself as a measure to gauge others
 VI
Yen Hui was eager to learn
Unfortunately his allotted span was a short one and he died
Mo Tzu concluded from this last paragraph that Confucius was a fatalist  All three philosophers believed that the ancestors were living in heaven and watching their descendants and interfering in what happened on earth
Elaborate funerals were held to show respect
Confucius supported rites and elaborate funerals
Mo Tzu said if the officials sincerely desire to practice benevolence and righteousness and to benefit the people of China they ought to adapt moderation in funerals as a principle of government
 The paragraphs also show that Confucius believed that it was possible for leaders to govern by acting virtuously and skeptical about the use of laws and punishment as advocated by Han Fei Tzu II..
Its easy to get caught up with the latest management fads but hard to know which ones will endure
Indeed Nassim Taleb writes about how time is the ultimate test for the fragility of ideas
So with China on the rise what better ideas to look at than Confucius who lived over  years ago
His sayings are in this book Analects which are said to have been recorded by his disciples
What Ive found is that Confucius was very good at understanding how to get the best out of hierarchical structures which today would equate just as easily to corporations as governments
So Ive picked out the best bits for business and modified the language to sound more contemporary Basics of working An overarching principle to work by is do not impose on others what you yourself do not want Someone who constantly learns will not be inflexible Avoid overpromising and underdelivering Money and status Money and status are what everyone wants but unless you get them in the right way dont hold on to them It is easier to be arrogant when rich then to complain of injustice when poor The good leader is at ease without being arrogant the bad leader is arrogant without being at ease Dont worry if you dont get the job title you want  worry about your qualifications and ability to do the job
Dont worry that no one appreciates your abilities  try to earn their appreciation Dont blame others for not seeing your talent blame yourself for not seeing their talents Managing others Surround yourself with people that are better than you The leader enters into transparent partnerships not factionscliques To get staff to look up to you promote the honest staff over the political ones People who are pleased with whatever the manager says is of no help to the manager A good manager helps others realise what is good in them the bad manager helps them realise what is bad in them Leadership Leadership is to know when you know and say you dont when you dont Five things will make a leader great respectfulness tolerance trustworthiness in words delivering results quickly and generosity Do not be impatient as you will not reach your goals
Do not be shorttermist as youll not accomplish the big goals If leaders themselves didnt act unethically noone would act unethically even if it carried a reward If a leader acts correctly others will follow them even without orders but if they are not correct in their actions others will not follow even if orders are given For more like this see bilalhafeez.com
Theres no doubt about it Confucius was a wise guy
If youre looking for quotes about virtue or really anything read this and Im sure youll find something
I found it interesting that certain values that arose in other parts of the world also arose there in China completely independent
An example would be found in Book  Do not impose on others what you would not like for yourself
Very similar to the Christian Golden Rule
Quite interesting
If youre at all interested in Chinese culturehistory this is a must read.
There were a fair number of sayings in this book that seemed pretty irrelevant or impenetrable to the modern reader mostly dealing with references to famous leaders of the past who would have been familiar to Confucious and his target audience but who most modern westerners will have never heard of
Also some of the phrasing is more than a touch convoluted
But there are a surprising number of the sayings that were perfectly clear and perfectly relevant even halfway around the world millennia later including a version of the Golden Rule
What I do not wish others to do to me that also I wish not to do to them
Chapter  Book  Im not certain how many of my complaints are due to the actual text and how many are due to having a cheap translation with few notes.
I found this to be a fascinating book because it presents a perspective on social morality and the obligations constructed around having a family and a duty to the society you live in
Im not sure if the translation is as accurate as it could be and there were times where the subtlety of the subject matter escaped me likely because Im not from china nor do I really have an accurate understanding of the culture in Confuciuss time let alone present time
Still I found this book fascinating because it presents a different perspective on social responsibility and morality toward the people we interact with
I highly recommend reading it as an opportunity to expand your horizons both culturally and for social responsibility.
I was surprised to find that I was often very interested in the topics within this book and Confucius handling of said themes
Having read Plato only a short time ago Confucius seemed like a breath of fresh air
His concerns are how to live a virtuous life and achieve benevolence
Unlike much ancient philosphy many of the sayings have their impact undimished by time
In each book consisting usually of about  pages there would generally be at least two or three sayings that struck me as truly meaningful and pertinent
Naturally there were also some that seemed out of place or irrational but that is to be expected in any text which is so old
If one is able to mine the gold from the rocks Analects of Confucius can be quite a rewarding experience
However I found the introduction and essays in the back of the book to be superfluous and felt that they did not shed much additional light on who Confucius was or what his teachings meant choosing instead to focus mostly on minutue that was mostly uninteresting to me
This book is not a long read and almost certainly worth a curious persons time.
The Analects of Confucius is one of the most influential books ever written anywhere
Although I cannot read the original Chinese this remarkably lucid translation makes me feel quite close to the source
The translation makes a point of allowing some of the dazzling fragments in the Analects to remain just that without trying to smooth them out artificially
This is important as it allows the modern reader to appreciate the complex texture of an ancient text on its own terms
Both the introduction and the endnotes are quite helpful in elucidating some of the difficulties and the ambiguities in the text encountered by the general reader
Additionally the size of the book is perfect
It is small enough to carry anywhere
Overall highly recommended
If when you think of eastern philosophy yourheart goes pitterpatter for esoteric revelations from AscendedMasters stories of Jesus practicing magic in Tibet as a youngster oreven the mindexpanding wit of Zhuang Zi you may find Confuciusboringly prosaic
 His wisdom lies in a different direction and ismore subtle
 The Analects is like a bowl of Chinese dumplings or attheir most flavorful dim sum that you pick out one at a time andlearn the taste and value of
 Few of his sayings are brilliant butrather the kind of mundane and kindly profundity that the warwearyChina of the late Zhou found so filling
 In modern China too I havefound that Confucius is very popular probably more popular than thewitty Lao Zi
Confucius said his teachings were connected by asingle thread
 While a disciple gave a slightly different solutionthe thread I suggest you follow through this otherwise ratherdisjointed collection of teachings and observations is humility
 Bythat I dont mean selfabnegation or loss of individuality in thecollective but an ability to see clearly in all directions  abovetowards superiors ultimately God below compassion for the needywithin To know what you know and know what you dont knowthis is knowledge and without to take an interest in the worldaround you
 Confucius became Chinas first teacherbecause he himself was eager to learn
To me this kindof integrated humility is the starting point for any worthwhilephilosophy of life
The Analects can also be of value to peopleinterested in the critical study of the New Testament by the way.This book greatly resembles the Gospels in terms of genre
 Bothconsist of sayings and actions of a teacher who traveled with a bandof disciples as recorded by the early community of followers
 Fewscholars doubt the historical character of the Analects whilecontroversy about the Gospels makes headlines on a regular basis
 Itis interesting to me that the same internal arguments scholars likeCreel and Lau use to prove the Analects apply even more strongly tothe Gospels
 If you do read the two sets of documents together youmight try the further experiment of comparing Confucius ideal personsage or Savior as Confucian scholar Chen Jingpan describeshim to the central character of the Gospels
 Remember that Menciussaid a sage would appear once every  years and Confucius lived in B.C
As a Christian I respect Confucius not only as a great moralteacher but also sometimes think he might have been a kind ofprophet
Five stars for Confucius one lost in translation.Soothill seems accurate as far as I can tell and the price is rightbut his language is a bit archaic at times
 Also be sure to get aversion with notes
Author True Son of Heaven How Jesus Fulfillsthe Chinese Culture ...
Filled with totally obfuscated phrases like The Kuanchu Ode is lively but not licentious plaintive but not harrowing are gems like Po I and Shu Chi never remembered old injuries and therefore their enemies were few
 The thing about it is that I read it cover to cover
 Clearly this deep and old wisdom is best taken in small bits for not many words are wasted
 Also the Lionel Giles translation I read was weak on supplemental commentary so I really felt like I needed a more knowledgeable guide as I was reading
 Perhaps the Norton version would have better annotations then the beautiful Easton Press version from my library
 It is clearly a five star book but I think I only got about three stars out of it
 Most certainly a book to read again and again and again.
I guess there is not much point in buying this book for the text of Lunyu itself it is available in full on the Internet for example at Wengu ..
 in the Chinese original two English  including Laus  and one French translation but it is the introduction and adjoining commentaries that are of value
In this respect I found D.C.Laus work quite pleasing
He explains the main terms and how they hang together illustrates his arguments with quotations from the actual Analects and tries his best to relate Confucius philosophy to suitable analogues in the Western tradition
I am no Chinaexpert so this helped a lot
The book also has a postscript outlining Kongzis life and a short piece on the individual disciples and friends that Confucius converses with in the book
I think there is  of value or whatever the price in this book.
I was reviewing when I found this book on Confucius
I have always been a fan of his philosophy and way of thinking
I like the fight and the believes he had in his times while others were more like following the troups and status of the dynasties
It was the wild west of the ancient world.
I had heard much about the Sayings but after actually reading them I can only say they left me quite unimpressed
There is very little in the book besides exhortations to be steady sincere and to obey ones parents and  tradition
Nothing at all is said about any sort of internal transformation  as one finds in LaoTze
I cant read Chinese so I cant say how accurate  the translation is but if this is what Confucius was all about I just  dont see what all the fuss is about.
While Penguin Classics paperbacks are generally some of the best on the market the Analects themselves are in this case a bit out a date
Better translations have been made in my opinion
However the prose itself is wellstyled and clearly separated
Concise and easy to understand
The fluency of the book is what seems most troubling.
VERY GOOD
Its amazing how after so many years Confucius thoughts are still important
Here you can find the basis for most of the later philosophists including some universal principles of most religions
Even though it is not easy to read with a little effort is a book to enjoy.
Thank you
This book contains the essential antiquities of ancient learning that fostered the development of the philosophies in the west in a clear easy to read format
I was amply impressed by the organization and  translation and doubly impressed by the fantastic price
I would highly  recommend for anyone just curious about philosophy or for anyone doing  scholarly research on this subject

This should be required reading for everyone by adulthood
 It gives you a unique perspective which no educated person should be without.
I dunno but my son does and he was please to receive multiple translations
 too much wordiness in the world
Essential for understanding East Asia
The quality of printing of the book new I received was rather poor
 I kept it just because I didnt want to go through the trouble of returning it.
Very instructive
I love it.
An interesting book with some thoughtprovoking quotes
 i dont know about other readers but it was a little confusing for me i got the feeling much of what is inside needs to be understood in context and thankfully there are a lot of sidenotes to go with it.
The Analects joined with a length introduction and notes on the key Confucsian teachings
Bit heavy duty at times but still interesting
Excellent quality and smart edition Love my book not to mention the content 
this is another book I bought for my grandson going to university and according to him its an excellent edition of it which hes very pleased withI was pleased with the usual efficient service from Amazon
Fascinating It is a book to dip into and think about
It may be old and Chinese but has thoughts relevant to today.
MANNERS AND RESPECT
Arrived in time and a great book to read and quality is good
Very good  makes you think and laugh
Its good to read the writings of the wise.
Some interesting points to think about
 The style is a bit rushed and abrupt...
Good book.
Excellent translation with a great introduction it helps to explain the subtleties and dual meanings that can be derived from the source text.
ty
Great book especially considering its age
Confucius is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest thinkers ever and his analacts a collection of his thoughts and teachings are right up there with Sun Tzus Art of War for the respect they still recieve today
Conficius has many great teachings in this very short book I trawled through it with a highlighter and regularly go back and reread the lines which mean the most to me
Some of his ideas can change the way you think and act towards others for the better if you take them onboard and apply them in your life
This book would also be good for anyone who appreciates inspiration books like Art of War for application in management situations
The ideas may be able to help you better understand communicate with and respect colleagues.
The book is considered as the Chinese Bible throughout the ages and widely read
Confucianism as an orthodox philosophy is based on The Analects
The book is a collection of Confuciuss wisdom compiled together by his disciples
These teachings are still relevant as selfknowledge and pursuit of virtue are ageless themes
Now about the quality of the book
This book is awfully produced to say the least
This is a Penguin Classics edition and they just failed themselves to do justice to their fame
From the font selection to the quality of pages everywhere a careless attitude is prevailing
The translation is up to the mark but the book has missed it.
Books from this edition are great nofuss books and theyre super cheap
This particular book however I found a bit harder to read because there are numerous references to individuals locations etc
which appear to be at the source of the meaning and in very few places are clarifications provided
Still this book is in some places very much a gem evenespecially in this day and age.

Il ny a rien de tel que la Bible
Les Analects sont des commentaires reformuls  la faon du matre voleur qui tourne les versets bibliques en essayant de faire croire quils ont t invents par lui
En somme du nimporte quoi on sennuie
A load of BS of make believe stolen from the Bible and twisted to fit asian wisdom from a common man
Waste of time and boring.
Must buy
You must add this to your home library collection.
I understand that this is no fault of the writers Confucius has much less surviving work than western counterparts Plato Aristotle etc
 and it can be a little offsetting
 This book wont read like Platos Republic Aristotles Politics or pretty much anything else  its more of a compilation of the sayings of Confucius hence Analects
 Some excerpts are a single line whilst others a whole page
 This makes for very easy picking up as you wont need to remember where you left off really
What I can make of this book is that Confucius was an extremely wise man and its a shame that he didnt write his own books
 Also there are great footnotes in this version of The Analects and extensive further reading material at the back of the book in addition to a very scene setting introduction
Itll be a quick read therefore buy it from a cheaper supplier but unquestionably worthwhile
Good work
Must for every book reader
interesting early writings on the evolutionary phenomenon of practical altruism
good book
Words of wisdom are profound and timeless indeed

not expected this quality from Penguin Classics
Confucius is boring
No need to say that this book is excellent but paper and print quality is not up to standard.
I purchased this having often enjoyed reading asserted Confucius quotes on sites such as wikiquote and others
When I discovered I could purchase them in this form I ordered it
About half a year later I started to read it having purchased many classics at once
I am not a stranger to reading philosophy odd perhaps considering my age 
I had read Nietzsche Milton Friedmans monograph Capitalism and Freedom much of Max Stirners The Ego and Its Own numerous political essays and opinion pieces Machiavellis The Prince...all those were much more cynical than Confucius who has a wonderful if cautious outlook on life
Nietzsche too has this property although it takes a reader to understand the underlying celebration and to reach the joyful regions of his arguments
Confucius known here generally as The Master can be summed simply he promotes wisdom and benevolence as the chief sources of happiness in life
To Confucius what follows this is loyalty social cohesion if we strive for benevolence then we are bound to please others and thus have them seek to please us
In other words Confucius believes that these elements help the reproduction of society and the reproduction of man
Confucius refreshingly believes that men can improve themselves and can become Gentlemen whether they are poor or are rich
Becoming a gentle man to twist the translation to show its etymological implications is therefore a wonderful cause and something which is rewarding
The early chapters are less interesting than the later but I picked up and read this over a long period of time a large break so I may be wrong
I would read a chapter or a half every day or two and would on the rest of my journey throughout the hours muse on them internalise them think on their wisdom
The less helpful passages are ones which are not as applicable to a secular Western reader such as about ancestor worship and perhaps too the rigorousness of filial piety obeying of ones parents and the writings based around tea and rice although we can substitute this and simply take the wisdom behind it
However the principles Confucius founds these ideas on are sound and are rigorously applied for example Confucius writes that If a man sets his heart on benevolence he will be free from evil the same is true of Kings Dukes Lords all of whom should lead by example Confucius believed having served in government himself in his younger years that if their leaders were good and kind so too would be their people
D.C
Laus edition is thoughtful and its footnotes are often helpful particularly on corruption
Something I did not note until I was near the end of the book was the very helpful glossary of names after the main text which I would recommend to use The Analects were written down by Confucius followers and friends thus the majority of the sayings are based around dialogue between those individuals and The Master
Confucius humility wisdom and sticking to his principles are refreshing
Most importantly to this review this book helped stabilise me at a time when I was uncertain and thinking a lot Nietzsche may have turned me into a man of dynamite I am not a man I am Dynamite Ecce Homo I feel Confucius helped turn me into a wiser man
Lightweight and easy to pick up Id recommend The Analects to anyone who perhaps wants to immerse themselves in one of the significant roots of Chinas culture and to immerse themselves in their own mind and thoughts
Often the most favourable interpretation of a saying is best be open and respectful to be Confucian and these sayings will help you as they certainly did with me
I only wish I had the volume here at university something I will rectify when I return home
 stars
Great
Material could better
Good book of orientel philosophy
page quality is not good.
dis book is amazing and also contemporary
great book i have ever read
must read for all .very nice .
Always useful to have a copy to read when you have five minutes or so
Great introduction explaining the context too.
Other than in passing reference I am new to Confucius body of work and The Analects have been an excellent place to start
 D
C
Laus introduction lays excellent ground for the reader to understand and put into context The Analects
 It is this introduction that makes this translation stand out from others I perused before purchasing
Having read through once I now use this book daily as a reference of useful and practical principles
 Much of the guidance given by Confucius is as relevant today as it was over  years ago
 In the spirit of Confucius I would recommend you apply his teachings as part of your own personal quest to self discovery to improve the world around you
Ahead of his time it is disappointing that Confucius and The Analects are not more common in education syllabuses to encourage young people to consider their environment politics and relationships with other human beings
 In a society where ego is usually a guiding principle of success I highly recommend The Analects as your own personal check and balance
I havent changed the world and Ive certainly not lost my ego but the teachings of Confucius in this publication have helped me temper my arrogance and consider my relationships with friends relatives and colleagues all for the better.
If you are interested in philosophy or just want to see what Confucius really said this is the book for you
Easy to dip in and out of.
Just what I wanted
Gives an introduction to Confucius followed by the sayings themselves
Couldnt have asked for anything more.
This is a very good Everyman edition of Confucius Analects with Arthur Waleys invaluable introduction
 Although the dustjacket was missing the book was in good condition and I am very satisfied
Essential reading for those wishing to understand China where Confucius teachings are tending once more to overshadow Marxism.
Worth Reading if you like Confucius.
The work of a master obviously what else do you need to know.
I bought this book as a present this was by far the cheapest  delivery took some time compared to one I had bought at the same time from a different amazon supplier  but it arrived in a plastic wrapper unopened untouched  I was very happy and so was my nephew
This book is a collection of insights from Confucius over his lifetime seperated by periods
It is good that there are no interpretations only translations
People purchasing this book should be aware of this as it is a difficult read with depth of understanding required beyond that of a scholar
Good choice to read.
the writing is too small so have to send it back
Interesting.
Show me a man who dont know Confucius and i will show you a baby who cant be loved.
Questionable translation but a cracking read Would recommend to any lads or ladettes out there who like a bit of Chinese philosophy.
This is a really good translation easy to read and very easy to follow
I enjoyed reading about his travels his way of treating his students and his love of behaving well
If you arent particularly religious it is a good guide for how to be a gentleman
Where it falls down for me is that there is very little attempt to answer the big questions death after death God why behave well anyway But I still give it the full number of stars.
Fantastic must read book
After reading this book I realized the the issues related to the human factor issues is real and last from few thousand of years
Its comforting from a certain point of view.
Good
Interesting if you love China history 
 
there is no Chinese original in this book only translation
Im looking for the the bilingual edition
The book is light and not very big good
maybe Ill give it to my friends as a present.
Knowledge
As expected
Interesting..
I found the Analects very uplifting and thought provoking and would recommend this book to anyone who likes to have their ideals and thoughts questioned.
Exactly as advertised and shipped quick.
OK
Im interested in most things of Chinese culture  history and am curious to find out more about Confucious  havent read much of it yet 
I like how confuciuses ruleswords can be still applied in this age and i spot on in many areas.
This book is extremely fragmentary
The text is corrupt in many parts and that is acknowledged by the writer
It has more to do with the life times culture of eastern philosophy than wisdom
Emperors lords masters servants
 It is okay as a book but you get the feeling that a completely new and revised copy needs to be produced
And where passages are inscrutable they should not be included as interpenetrating them would be a guess
This book should be brought back to the drawing board but has merit as a good work of philosophy and summary of eastern culture.
Its easy to get caught up with the latest management fads but hard to know which ones will endure
Indeed Nassim Taleb writes about how time is the ultimate test for the fragility of ideas
So with China on the rise what better ideas to look at than Confucius who lived over  years ago
His sayings are in this book Analects which are said to have been recorded by his disciples
What Ive found is that Confucius was very good at understanding how to get the best out of hierarchical structures which today would equate just as easily to corporations as governments
So Ive picked out the best bits for business and modified the language to sound more contemporary Basics of working An overarching principle to work by is do not impose on others what you yourself do not want Someone who constantly learns will not be inflexible Avoid overpromising and underdelivering Money and status Money and status are what everyone wants but unless you get them in the right way dont hold on to them It is easier to be arrogant when rich then to complain of injustice when poor The good leader is at ease without being arrogant the bad leader is arrogant without being at ease Dont worry if you dont get the job title you want  worry about your qualifications and ability to do the job
Dont worry that no one appreciates your abilities  try to earn their appreciation Dont blame others for not seeing your talent blame yourself for not seeing their talents Managing others Surround yourself with people that are better than you The leader enters into transparent partnerships not factionscliques To get staff to look up to you promote the honest staff over the political ones People who are pleased with whatever the manager says is of no help to the manager A good manager helps others realise what is good in them the bad manager helps them realise what is bad in them Leadership Leadership is to know when you know and say you dont when you dont Five things will make a leader great respectfulness tolerance trustworthiness in words delivering results quickly and generosity Do not be impatient as you will not reach your goals
Do not be shorttermist as youll not accomplish the big goals If leaders themselves didnt act unethically noone would act unethically even if it carried a reward If a leader acts correctly others will follow them even without orders but if they are not correct in their actions others will not follow even if orders are given For more like this see bilalhafeez.com
Interesting
This version was translated by a ChineseAmerican scholar who had moved to the US when she was  so the English was perfect and easy to read
She had a lot of added commentary which gave you a very complete and understandable look at the times Confucius lived in
She used other Chinese commentators on his work to add to the readers understanding
He lived in turbulent time and I found his advice and admonitions to be relevant even to a st Century American.
There is magic in Annping Chins commentarial remarks
 They clarify Confuciuss words by providing cultural and linguistic detail
 This makes The Analects fresh and meaningful
 They come to life
 I used to wonder why Confucius is held in esteem.
Ive been trying to learn more about China particularly hoping to get some glimpses of its present state by seeing its past
Confucian thought has been a driving force for many years so I dabbled in this book
As usuall it answered less and aroused more questions yet it still is amazing to see that basic human needs and wants rarely change
I wonder if the ancient Egyptians had something similar
There are many English versions of the Lunyu Analects but this is arguably the best
The  English is lucid but the outsatanding feature is the annotations that explain much that would be obscure to general readers and even sinologists whose expertise is on later periods
If you are curious about Confucius this is the book to start with.
I had to buy this book for a university class called CHIN
I didnt understand the entire context at first but then I read the Tao Te Ching and in the context of the Tao Te Ching this book now makes perfect sense.
I would like only the Analects there seems to be to much interpretation.
Liking this a lot
 Currently wading through it.
Another great classic to enjoy I love it.
Very well put together
The Analects is the primary work within the Confucian canon but by no means an easy read
The format of the book is a compilation of sayings attributed to Confucius followed by analysis by the books translator Chin Anping
 A clear strength is the updated translation using the standard Pin Yin as opposed to the phonetically misleading WadeGiles system coupled with a more updated and correct understanding of the proverbs and sayings
 The works primary focus is upon moral character stressing the need to be humane the character of a gentleman and how a just ruler should behave
For the latter there is surprisingly fewer analects than one would expect which may leave those wanting a more clear understanding of the Chinese mindset on governance wanting for more
 It is worth noting that the Analects is the first work in the Confucian canon which was greatly expanding by followers such as Mencius and Xunzi
 Not an easy read but an essential one for understanding Chinese views on morals and principles.
Cant wait to read this baby the first one got lost upon delivery
This book is important for philosophy in general but more specifically it is both cultural and historical for the Chinese which is really good to further your views
Hence why one might want to read it.
The Analects is to Ancient China what Meditations is to Ancient Rome
There are many versions of this deeply important work but this translation by Annping Chin is the best of them all
Why Because it is complete one cannot understand the passages without commentary providing the context and Annping Chin is one of the leading experts on the life of Confucius in the West her translation and annotations bring the sentiments of the great philosopherpractitioner and his students to life
Secondly this work features both the English translation and the original Chinese text for crossreference
Confucianism is a philosophy that has many interpretations it has survived for thousands of years and has a long way to go this is the first choice text for understanding and important aspect of Chinese culture and receiving guidance for your own life.
Very good interpretation by this translator.
Read this to understand Xi Jinping
The book came damaged
It looks like its been used before
Well received in good condition
This is the first half of C
H
BrewittTaylors translation of the thcentury Chinese classic
I am reading his translation in parallel with Moss Robertss translation
While I am unable to judge the comparative accuracy of the two renditions as a reader I considerably prefer Robertss translation primarily due to his extensive and illuminating endnotes
Lacking the information in those endnotes I think I would have been unable to appreciate the narrative
The one respect in which I prefer the BrewittTaylor translation is that he inserts paragraph breaks when the text switches from one speaker to another
He also adopts a somewhat more archaic prose style than Roberts does which may appeal to some readers though not me as suggesting the storys venerable age
The original Chinese novel was penned over six hundred years ago and is based on historical events from about  A.D
I note that I am finding it helpful to read each chapter twice once in each translation
The book has a vast cast of characters none of whom I was familiar with before but many of whom would have been known to its original audience
Reading a chapter again allows me a sense of what it would be like if I wasnt trying to remember who everybody was and which faction they supported
Although this is slightly undermined by the two translations using different schemes for transliterating Chinese names
I will postpone comment on the books quality as a story until I eventually make my way to the end
P.S
My rating of  out of  stars is as much a rating for the translation as for the underlying story and I may well end up giving the Robertss translation a higher rating.
This review doesnt really concern the story  Romance of the Three Kingdoms is justly a classic piece of literature and itd be slightly ridiculous to review the story itself on an Amazon review
Its amazing and exciting and definitely read it if you can
What I will review  and what I have significant problems with  is the Tuttle edition for Kindle
I cant really speak on the printed edition but a lot of my criticisms I suspect will apply
Firstly there are a ton of typos
Im averaging one per page now
Things like Today her son is on the throne and all the officials are her friends and her influence is enormous
It seems petty and normally Id ignore it but it gets on your nerves after a while
The fact that there are so many of these errors speaks to a lack of proper editing I think which leads to my next point a lot of the prose is pretty bad stylistically
It varies from place to place but its at best annoying and at worst a serious impediment
More than once Ive had to stop and ask myself who is the subject of this sentence or even who is the direct object which takes me out of the action while I have to parce the previous paragraph and see who the translator is talking about
The register of the translation changes as well  one second a character might be speaking in a very formal periphrastic bureaucratese and then end the sentence with something jarringly vernacular
It seems like a minor issue but things like that can confuse characterization and are just generally poor usage
More generally the dialogue is stilted and artificial The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Chien Shih
Stylistically its an awkward sentence  why phrase it like that It seems pretty obvious that the translator was probably not a native speaker  which is fine as long as theres a strong editor to clean things up which seems to be lacking here
The next one is a bit of a preference thing Ill admit usage of WadeGiles
When I was learning Chinese Pinyin was the ONLY romanization used
Say what you want about the merits of WadeGiles but Pinyin is what people are going to generally be familiar with today
So when I read through this and see I think Kongsun Tsan I have to stop and translate it in my head Kongsun Tsan Is that Gongsun Zan Ive read this book  different editions  a number of times so Im familiar with the characters
Otherwise Id honestly be lost
Now I hear what youre saying but what about the people that dont know anything about China WadeGiles would be so much simpler
That way people arent pronouncing Cao as Cow There are a number of other issues in the book that make that a questionable argument
Firstly WG has its issues here as well  Kongsuns Kong is not pronounced as in King Kong
There are a number of reasons why it would make a bit of obscure linguistic sense to write it that way for romanization purposes once more to do with consnant voicing but someone utterly unfamiliar with Chinese would be tripped up by it just as well as they would with Pinyins c equalling roughly ts
But this is a huge digression
For the uninitiated there are somewhat larger issues
Most notably the usage of ranks
The book is a bit ambivalent about this when we first meet Guangong the book notes that this signifies he is Lord Guan as gong  lord
Other times however the book introduces ranks Chinese ranks without a single explanation of what it is soandso was at the time occupying the rank of ssutu
Well ok  what is this rank Where is it on the hierarchy Is it low or high For the record ssutu is situ or Minister of Education
Its worth noting that the edition didnt even get this right ssutu would be sidu in Pinyin as tudu and tutu
If you care the apostrophe as far as I know here represents differentiation in consnant voicing
Why was it necessary to tell us this character was ssutu without explaining WHAT it was The Minister of Education an important post which would help explain why this person was in a position to plan a coup
The book does this a number of times which makes the sections revolving around court intrigue especially painful as were told person x had position a person y had position b and person x had position c with the positions generally not elaborated upon
The worst part is when the book half does this and half doesnt Commissioner X told Y Ssutu note the Chinese syntax for titles suchandsuch
Some titles are fully translated and some arent  so were hearing Empress Ling tell Tung Taihou Dowager Empress something
It then switches
Overall INCREDIBLY confusing for a book that has so many important interludes in the highly stratified court
So we have a confused usage of ranks some English some Chinese some mixed which at times have no explanation as to what they are or where they are in the court hierarchy
At best weve been briefed once and its NEVER touched again
Why couldnt the translator simply render ssutu as Minister of Education throughout the book What would it have taken away that was more important than clarity
My mother in law recommended this book
Its a great read to learn Chinese history from a fictional book.
This is a great work of literature and this editions introduction is a great transition for the Western reader into the right mindset.
I would definitely have enjoyed it more if I could follow the characters
The characters are numerous and have VERY complicated and some similar names.
This is a must for those who enjoy history
Its a Chinese classic and Ive read both books
This is reading I would recommend.
good gift for a dear friend.

the end of the Han Dynasty
This version of the book is  horrible the names are all wrong or badly translated
 If you want to read and enjoy the three kingdoms look elsewhere.
Very historical and clearly relating to a Biblical writing in the February  th  article in the Daily Bread publication
Had wanted this for a gift but now am not sure
The item was unopened at least apparently but had been noticeably dented on one corner making me hesitate to use it as a gift item
Rather disappointed although in checking the description it doesnt exactly violate it
Maybe I should have been more careful but would have liked to have seen that in the description so I could have bought something else.
stilted translation makes it tedious going
Storyline evolves is that the right wordwanders along too much Chinese structure to this extremely predictable story.
This book is enormous
Two volumes with around  pages
It is a long saga an epic some say in a way a picaresque epic across the whole of China during the Han dynasty of the empire when that empire was at risk because of internal strife and the incapability of the emperor to keep things under control by his own fault the own fault of several emperors one after another and inability of building some kind of government that could be reliable transparent and noncorrupted
And that is where the book is amazingly revealing
This empire is quite obviously a feudal empire
Power is in the hands of governors appointed by the emperor in each district
The governors are appointed for what these people did for the empire particularly what they did militarily and there the difference between serving the empire and serving themselves is not always clear
Ambitious people can climb to the top in no time and then impose their power
The decomposition of this empire started when the various feudal lords or lordlings started considering the eunuchs organized in a very close community and clan who were provided by the emperor with the full control of the government because the emperor is lazy in many ways and looks for an easy way to control such a big empire and because the emperor is incompetent technically ignorance of a lot of things necessary for government and psychologically unfit to exercise such an enormous power
He then relied on the eunuchs of the empire a clan of men  and their relatives  who had been castrated for any reason whatsoever among others to become the top officers of the empire
The most famous eunuch along that line was Admiral Zheng He who had been castrated at an early age because he was a Muslim and he became the top man of the Chinese fleet before it was dismantled by the Confucian Mandarins when they took over around 
These corrupted eunuchs encourage all kinds of outlaws to go around in the country and raid cities and farming areas to their own profit and to the shared profit with local supporters of the eunuchs
A rebellion came from the various local or regional lords who had the power and the means to raise armies
They united and finally succeeded in getting all the eunuchs eliminated and executed but the main military force was in the hands of an ally of the local and regional lords an exoutlaw who shifted from raiding cities and farming communities to raiding the central government by taking control of it
The empire is then at stake because it explodes into rivaling cities and provinces and the central brigand controlling the empire spreads and increases his power by taking control of rebellious provinces
This is typically feudal
Power is in the hands of the stronger person of the stronger clan and stronger means military force and nothing else
Then this power is only a way for those in power to loot the country by levying armed forces and taxes for their own profit
Then the emperor can even be chosen within the Han line but for how long Thats the beginning of the saga but that explains the whole saga feudalism was the real social and political architecture of the Chinese empire
The main originality is that there was no spiritual or religious authority of any sort that could set some criteria and norms for everyone and keep the whole empire unified by some kind of spiritual allegiance unity
Thats the main difference with European feudalism that was entirely controlled and governed by the Catholic church hence by the Pope and his bishops and cardinals
Nothing like that in the Chinese Empire
So no Peace of God becoming then Peace of the King in the various kingdoms a movement that outlawed the use of military force within the limits of each kingdom and also within the limits of Christendom
That explained in part the crusades that started in the th century but it also explained the Teutonic crusade against the nonChristian Slavonic people in Poland Ukraine and what they called Lithuania
War was directed to outside areas officially nonChristian and to be Christianized
That started quite early after the fall of the Roman Empire and later on the fall of Charlemagnes empire who only fought against the various Asian tribes or military forces trying to penetrate Europe from the East and against the mostly Muslim Saracens trying to do the same from Spain
And the emergence of such a spiritual force took a lot of time
The book was written after the takeover of the empire by the Confucian Mandarins and we could wonder if it is not a reflection of this evolution in the th century that inspired the author to show how bad it could have been before when the empires unity was endangered by internal strife and its unity was rebuilt later on by the leaders of the three kingdoms
We have to think of the other great saga of Chinese literature Journey to the West by Wu Chengen a saga whose earliest extant copy is traced to  and is the story of a Monkey that travels to the west to discover the famous Buddhist scriptures that found the Taoist approach of life that developed in China as the spiritual guideline of the empire and can be considered as the basis of the Confucian Mandarin takeover in the th century
That is rather amazing to see this empire evolving from a purely feudal state with a marginal Taoist presence seen more like some witchcraft than anything else though they carry the Chinese medical tradition and the ethical code of Taoism the Chinese version of Buddhism in the making
Their final victory will destroy the Chinese fleet the most impressive one in the whole world at the time vastly centered on the China seas and the entire Indian Ocean and that would have been  capable to defend the empire against the European invasion that was still to come when Admiral Zheng He died
The result was a total closing up of the empire onto itself which enabled the Europeans to come and take control of the whole of the Indian Ocean and then of the China Seas
Closing up on itself made the Chinese Empire weak particularly the tool of its power was destroyed the various commercial routes known as the Silk Roads
You will find all that in these books and it will make clear that the present commercial policy of China to reopen and redevelop the various Silk Roads is the only way for China to develop and recapture its past greatness
Will this policy reestablish some feudal state Hardly conceivable
Will it establish some hierarchical centralized and unified system in the whole country and beyond Thats also a dubious unrealistic view
China has to open itself to the world but that will not lead to the looting the English the French and later on the Japanese tried to impose to China but it may turn Chinas as the beating heart of the global economy or at least one of the beating hearts of the global world using its commercial power rather than military force
That should bring you to wondering if the use of military force is not a feudal way of looking at the world and trying to dominate it
You may come to wondering if president Trumps approach of the world is not a feudal way of looking at the problem in total opposition to and contradiction with the Chinese commercial approach of president Xi
To conclude I will say that Chinese literature old or more recent like Lao Shes books and plays is always centered on this problematic of the whole world in development and the choice between three possibilities  pure military force and a feudal system  pure spiritual closing up onto themselves and their protected own resources some Confucian hierarchical architecture  a general commercial vision that brings economic development to the world modern sharing resources via some global free but regulated marketplace
Just get into this saga and enjoy the action and the treacherous ways of most of these feudal lords

Romance of Three Kingdoms is a part of East Asian culture
It overtook the heart of both Chinese and Japanese as well as people in Southeastern Asia
In Japan even younger generation who rarely read literature enjoy the story in the form of either comic books or in popular PC games
In China many of the Chinese Opera plays come from the part of this story
Every Chinatown around the world has one or some GuandiKuan Ti Temples such as those in Nagasaki Kobe and Yokohama
The story is based on the history of ancient China around late nd century to late rd century when the Chinese continent was divided by three strong kingdoms WeiGui in JapaneseWuGO in Japanese and ShuSHOKU in Japanese
Part of the popularity of three kingdoms in Japan must be credited for Eiji Yoshikawa the author of Musashi focusing more on the story of Liu BeiShu emperorGuan Yu Zhang Fei and Zhuge Liang
Comic book adaptation by Mitsuteru Yokoyama who is best known by the author of Iron ManTetsujin paved the way for current three kingdom boom in Japanese pop culture in general
Liu Bei an heir of Han Dynasty ruling clan is a humane leader supported by Guan Yu deft both in brain and might maybe eastern version of Knight Zhang Feishort tempered but really strong warrior and Zhuge Liang the master of strategy
Rivaling Lie Bei is another giant Cao Cao outstanding ruler and historically known as one of the finest compilers of Sun Tzus Art of War
Cao Cao courting the emperor Xian nearly took hold of the whole Chinese continent but was blocked by the allied forces of Wu and Shu in  as the dramas such as depicted
Cao Cao is a bit demonized in this story but he is in fact one of the greatest rulers China ever had comparable to Napoleon
Lie Bei who has little power gradually gains by charming a lot of talented people by his couteousness yet with propaganda tactics to demonize Cao Cao
 Cao Cao soon recovered from the defeat of the Chibi battle and with the finest staff collected from the whole continent he sought to break the alliance of Shu and Wu
After the death of Cao Cao Cao Pi took over and named himself the emperor of Weihan
But Weihan would eventually be overthrown by Sima clan who would subdue both Shu and Wu but Lie Bei Guan Yu and Zhuge Liang are still loved and idealized by Chinese public
On first reading you will be enjoying the way the characters outsmart the other camps
On second reading you will be struck by the humanity upon which the story is based
It is much more than a legend
It will surely get you closer to the mind of either Chinese and Japanese
But be careful
The way character name is pronounced differ between Chinese and Japanese
Such as Cao Cao is pronounced in Japanese as SOSO
 Now I must add a few things for newer k fans who encountered this epic through koei games
Koei adopts Pinyin system for three kingdom character names and pinyin method has almost subdued English speaking community
Brewitt Taylor uses Wade system differing so much from the way the character names were currently spelled
For example
Cao Cao is spelled Tsao Tsao
As you can see older system is useful in pronunciation ideas
Verdict Excellent translation getting you much closer to this Chinese epic
Mustread for chivalry novel fans
Rating  out of 
A bit cut by spelling confusion as I mentioned
Recommended for the fans of Sun Tzus Art of War Chinese dramas or action and war fictions.
This is an older translation sometimes it opts for pseudomedieval vocabulary and as many others have noted it uses the WadeGiles system of romanizing the Chinese names rather than the pinyin one more often used these days
The newer translation by Moss Roberts probably reads better and has more apparatus but is not available as an ebook
This ebook does allow one to read the Romance in English on your favorite Kindle platform but the ebook like so many of them is quite badly made
It seems to have been scanned and run through an OCR program but not proofread properly so that quite aside from the Chinese names English words come out misspelled on a regular basis
You can almost always emend the garbled reading but its a bit embarrassing for a once respectable publisher like Tuttle.
The story is truly a classic and the translation is pretty good
 However the actual product is pretty sloppy
 Volume one was less problematic than volume two but both had a high number of instances
 The main problem is that letters that are similar in shape such as b and d p and g etc
get switched almost once a page
 Also the names werent proofread very well as apostrophes get pretty regularly left out
 In a translation system where an apostrophe is the only difference between the names to two characters or places this becomes a source of confusion
 Also entire words are left out pretty regularly
 I wonder if any highly fluent English speakers actually got to proofread this because most of these errors are so obvious
 These errors arent so bad that it is unreadable but they really take a person out of the scene while the confusion is dispelled.
It is a well made TV series based on this classic
Characterization and acting are all excellent I am especially impressed by the period costume and the set they looked very well executed and certainly added to the enjoyment of the whole series
you can input the following to search YouTubeThree Kingdoms  EpisodeEnglish Subtitles
This is a very good bok filled with brotherhood strategy battles loyalty chivalry etc
And although quite longit is still worth it
It is a cultural classic just like the Iliad and the Odyssey are to Greek culture
 It has many misspellings but they are easily surmounted and pose no real threat to the stories comprehension
I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading especially those who enjoy historicalcultural or classical books
 Note This translation may be somewhat confusing to some people because it uses the more oldfashioned WadeGiles spellings rather than the more contemporary Pinyin System
 If you were introduced to the Three Kingdoms through the multiple video games that are outas I was that use the Pinyin system it might take a little extra thought on your part to understand who is who as you are reading
For Example Guan Yu and Cao Cao in Pinyin become Kuan Y and Tsao Tsao in WadeGiles.
I love the Three Kingdoms
However having read BrewittTaylors masterful exposition this translation seems lacking in my opinion
First I must confess I hate the modern Pinyin system of romanization
I cannot abide in a system where letters do not have the proper values
I mean an entire generation of Americans and God help the ignorant French will pronounce names like Cao Cao as Cow Cow or the Qin dynasty as the Kwin dynasty
The BrewittTaylor translation uses the old Wade system and while it can be hard on the eyes the reader gets a sense of at least the rough pronunciation Cao Cao is rendered Tsao Tsao Qin is rendered Chin etc
Also BrewittTaylors translation is nice to listen to
Empires wax and wane states cleave asunder and coalesce the sound itself is beautiful and yet still renders the sense clearly
The Roberts translation certainly succeeds in the latter but the beauty is lost
However BrewittTaylor requires a very great vocabulary whereas Roberts is more tame in this regards
Still this was a book for scholars and the translation should at least reflect that
Again if you have no familiarization with the events of this tale the complete rainstorm of names is daunting indeed
Always keep in mind the three separate forces Cao Cao of Wei Liu Bei of Shu and the Sun family of Wu as well as a few of the other players Zhang Jiao of the Yellow Scarves Dong Zhuo Lu Bu Yuan Shao
Liu Biao and Liu Zhang and youll do fine
The book itself in my opinion is the greatest book ever told succeeding in being at once a work of strategy psychology government warfare and human emotion and there is nothing like it in the lexicon of Western literature
Enjoy
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is one of my favorite novels
Unfortunately for this version however the story is not done much justice in its Pinyin translation
For newcomers to the series it is quite difficult to become accustomed to it
I would recommend a WadeGiles translation of this novel
On the plus side this version is completely unabridged so readers gain the full experience of one of Chinas great literary classics.
Details of the past are brought into sharp focus in this fascinating account.
It was a great quality and fur exceeded my expectation
I would choose used book next time too
 It is not only economical but ecological too
Thank You
I enjoying reading it except the following problems  Typos are almost appeared in every  pages
 Stories are not link between paragraphs
There are pages that I have to read  times in order to picture what is going on and who and who die
How about describe more about the heros when introducing them like how old what weapon they used and how strong
I believe those will spice up the book a lot more
EQ
Romance of the Three Kingdoms Volume  Tuttle..
Lo KuanChung
Wow Volume  of  I believe and I was initially very confused about the pronounciations and spelling of the names of the characters before I realised I was thinking in a very Eurocentric way without taking into account the fact that the translations within are probably more accurate than those in the console games that have developed from these accounts
However having worked my way through my confusion this is an epic historical piece rightly broken down as thew weight of the entirety would be too much to lift The story of the fall of a Dynasty and the turmoil that followed very much engages although I suppose you have to have a hiostorical turn of mind to get into it
Not just a list of times people and events but a full narrative that tells of both the personal and political struggles that surfaced during the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
Perfect for the gift I wanted to give someone
Thank you.
Amazing book...such an interesting recollection of that era
I have read and reread The three Kingdoms many times over the years
It is one of the greatest novels ever written
This is why I have bought a new copy  the old one is too much read.
Primera parte de esta enorme obra de la literatura China excelente traduccin algo anticuada si bien la edicin deja bastante que desear
No entiendo porque los editores con el afn de reducir costes publican en papeles de tan baja calidad y no cuidan ms el aspecto de este tipo de libros que merecen algo mejor.
Good quality arrived safely from Germany to Canada
 My boyfriend was so happy to get this book for Christmas.
exam required
Wade system   Wade systemChineeseEnglish      Taylor Taylor 
Was bought as a gift
He was extremely happy that he got it.
It might be a classic but for readers used to modern writing its really quite difficult to follow
a plethora of characters with names so similiar it takes ages to realise whos who
Id say only for enthusiasts of classic asian literature.
Very good story
The English is not very perfect but I liked it too.
Got this for the great reviews and the fact its awardwinning....but who edited this Ive read  page novels with intense dialog between  characters simultaneously without typos or grammatical errors
I honestly am not trying to pick this book apart but saw  before I even got to the actual translation
Perhaps Im OCD but I couldnt get past the editing and returned this book the day I received it
Like another reviewer I also get the impression Im expected to buy many of the authors other books to fully understand Sun Tzus concepts.
I have no doubts about the quality of the translation
However the editing in the introduction is fairly sloppy
Not enough to dissuade me from purchasing this text but still
For a book that has received so many awards the grammar and punctuation ought to be excellent from beginning to end
In the very first paragraph the sentence reads This work is based on many years of study the original Chinese and teaching the its strategy worldwide
Although its a small mistake I noticed two other grammaticalpunctuation errors in the first three pages
Grammar pains aside Im looking forward to reading this text
This review is more for whoever edited this book to improve coherence in future editions.
Im going to give  stars for the actual book and  for the kindle edition
The publisher should have made it clear that is not a kindle but just the book scanlated page by page
Highlighting is not enabled Im not sure how is this better than buying the actual book
Actually it worse If I had scanlated the book page by page for personal use I could have used highlighting in pdf view.
Bought another translation of the art of war before and it was a joke
Finally a book that is not pgs and how its listed is well organize.
Bought this for my son who isnt a reader by nature but is enthralled with this type of subject
He loves the fact that it is translated literally and feels as he has learned so much already from reading it though not too awful far into the book
He is irritated that he has to put it down to read other things for his schooling
The best thing about this purchase is that I overheard him discussing the book and its some of the strategies with his Daddy the other morning rather than talking about the usual morning chit chat
Thats a good thing
Hes thinking beyond the usual.
Well written and precise
Best version iv ever read.
one of the best ones out there the author did a good job on the translation
Worst printing quality I have seen
The paper and Ink quality is very bad ..
probably like many other  made in China products
Excellent book
I have several copies to give to friends and family
book
This book can help anyone in a crisis
 It teaches you to be calm
 It teaches specific strategies
 Highly recommend.
Great book I always wanted to read this
These tactics still apply today
Military leaders should read this
Absolutely love this book
Excellent
 Well written book
 Explains concepts and how to apply  them.
I like that the meanings of the text are explained in laymans terms
Very good book.
Pages fall out poor binding.
My husband wanted to read this and its an amazing read 
Book came fast and was as described.
Fast shipping good read
I ordered this for my  yo son as a Christmas gift
I read it before I wrapped it
Very interesting
Full of useful information that can be applied to every day situations
I know hell love it.
I like to provide material that stimulates your mind
My son wanted this book and I was happy to purchase.
All products met my expectations
Arrived early and husband loved the book.
After comparing the Chinese text with the english text side by side.
I will compare the Chinese Art of War to cooking with sauce
It is like..
living scripture
Openly interpreted
The english version is like microwaving
You just get the food
It is already interpreted for you which can be helpful as a hand rail but without the original Chinese you lose all the sauce what makes the text brilliant in the first place
This is an unorthodox review
I will say wow
I really like this book
This is the right version of Art of War for an english reader
Next level would be to learn Chinese and read the original
It is an incredible law book.
Yes there are grammatical and punctuation errors
Still I have had  versions and for me this is the best easiest translation to read and actually understand
Course Im a Redneck so words over two syllables do tend to confuse me
 Bottom line if you want a translation that makes sense and that you can understand this is the one

The book is outlined pretty clearly and takes you from one topic to the next quite effortlessly
 The translation form the Chinese language seems very well done.
Good read..
Everybody should read this some time in their life and apply it it in their daily life
It should be required reading for all business people.
Arrived as needed and stated
The book is s Christmas present
So I cant state more then that
Phenomenal book
For accuracy and keeping true to the source this book is great and contains the original Chinese and how they translated it just in case you wish to interpret the language in your own ways for a deeper meaning in a sense because words in Chinese can often have many meanings and be interpreted in multiple ways
What I did not like in particular was the occasional suggestion cropping up throughout the pages that in order read some of the extra art of war material one would have to buy several other books from the same author as its not all contained within this book.
I bought this to read on my kindle ebook but found that it was not compatible with my device
I had to return for a refund
waste of my time
Absolutely chuffed with my book the only reason why I gave it  and not  is only because the writing is small it would be brilliant if you could do it in large print I did look but couldnt find any that were in English
 and  for fast delivery
Highly recommended
Excellent read and informative
As per expectations
Nice gift
Qute amazing
Nicely done The arrangement makes the translated text not only easier to understand but allows the reader to comprehend the Chineseness of the text and therefore provides a much fuller comprehension of the tactics and philosophy of Sun Tzu.
If you want to read The Art of War dont buy this thing
Its a  page outlined and bulleted version
Amazon is starting to annoy me with crappy vague representations of the products sold
The product description for this book is several paragraphs long but fails to mention this is not the actual book
Now I have to take the time to return it or just take the  hit and use it as kindling.
Perhaps I missed something in the description but this thing is TINY
Its basically a hyper condensed cliffs notes version and it seems to focus almost entirely on military conflict
 yes I know art of war what did I expect  The Art of War is more than a military handbook it encompasses the subject of conflict more than actual military war
 It was meant to be as useful to a mother trying to get her child to go to bed as it is for a general about to engage in a troop movement
 This is not actually a terrible version its just chopped up and weirdly tiny.
Very misleading description and title
THIS IS NOT THE FULL BOOK
This is an abbreviated  page recap of some of the chapters takeaways
Its my fault for not looking at how many pages the book was before ordering but it should clearly say in the title and description that this isnt the complete book
Disappointed with misleading information.
I was extremely disappointed after getting this book
I assumed it was the full length text  pages but what I received was a pamphlet sized text
You know what they say about assuming things you can make an A out of you and me....
well I did it to myself
To be fair...
the description DOES say  pages..
I should have known better
None the less I put in a request to return this item as I have no need for  pages of bullet points..
UPDATE I received a full copy of the text and I went back to reference this text
ONLY A FEW CHAPTERS WE CLOSE TO SIMILAR..
lots of different verbiage and it looks like the text was changed up to someones interpretation..
DO NOT BUY IF YOU WNAT THE FULL TEXT Thank you 
While I am partially to blame for ignorantly forgetting to read reviews prior to purchasing this product it is also deceiving
I always try to read reviews to ensure what I am buying is legitimate and a worthwhile purchase
This is not the full text of Art of War and it is never stated as being anything less
Upon receiving it I was disappointed immediately when I saw the size
While I did read it in about  minutes it was quite a disappointment compared to what I wanted
My advice is to research before buying as there are many of this watered down style floating around in Amazon.
Yes its about war
 But Sun Tzus strategies for war work amazingly well in business and any competitive endeavor
 I bought a copy of this book to pass along his wisdom to a new high school graduate
 The format of the books is highly accessible and an easy read
 I have other copies of the book with additional notations and explanations
 Theyre fine for background research but I like this version for quick access to Sun Tzus insights.
A quick read that supposedly teaches skills needed in management or on the battlefield
Know your enemy
Never completely surround your enemy
Treat your army as you would your children show them love yet do it with an iron fist
Pretty basic stuff on how to defeat obstacles in life.
Purchased as a gift to one of my ROTC Cadets to begin their professional library
As part of a class assignment I asked each cadet what book would they nokidding read military or not related to their academic major or not
After I compiled the list of books for the class I went online and ordered all the books from Amazon
I placed them at their seats prior to class and allowed them to enter the room wo me being present for the first five minutes
It was and still is one of the good teaching moments of our time together
Thanks for helping me fulfill a need in their soontobe military career.
Description highly misleading
This is a  page summary not the full book.
Whether a military warrior a martial artist or a business man Sun Tsus principles are timeless wisdom that can apply to many walks of life
 A great addition to your collection
 I keep going back to mine again and again.
It is easy to see why this material transcends through history  and applies to military tactics to this day
It is also very easy to see how the philosophy of Sun Tzu serves as inspiration for so many martial arts as well
Im glad I finally got to read the whole thing.
The book is as good as it has been for centuries however the narration was surprisingly bad
 The narrator misread many words throughout the book
 It was as if the narrator did not have adequate reading skills because they would say words completely different from what was printed
 This was confusing because the words the narrator said made no sense in the context of the sentence
 This made it so that i couldnt just listen to the book i had to instead continually make sense of the narrators mistakes.
The brochure is a waste of money and time
Its written entirely through numeric points that mostly make no sense
The sentences are written in very simple language which could be either from the original author or a result of the translation
The described tactics are merely common sense nothing surprising or extraordinary
The Art of War in this form of brochure serves at best to stabilize a wobbly table.
No where is the description it state this was not the full book
It shows over  stars on more than  reviews so I thought it would be a safe buy
 This is only some odd abbreviated version of the book
Its a waste of money dont but this one
Thought this was actually the book..
turns out to be a page pamphlet version.
I simply read this because I wanted to see what it was all about
It is a classic and has its place among Beijing in the most important ancient texts all g with the bible
I read this for fun and did not analyze or pick it apart
I recommend read it if you are into these kind of books.
This could just be my air but I always thought this was a large book and this thing is a paperback pamphlet size of a Jehovah witness brochure
For the price I guess its not bad but I was expecting a book.
The book is a classic and there very little to be said about this that has not been said by more experts on warfare then this reader
I recommend it to any person that is considering a career in the military
Volumes have been written on how to conduct military operations but in this case less is more in this small book is a wealth of experience and knowledge that translates into the present state  of modern warfare
The shame is that many in the military that have read it cant seem to utilize the lessons to be learned that are clearly expressed in it.
Read it
Put it to practice
Highly recommend this book for anyone looking to achieve victory
Power overwhelming
Godspeed mortal.
I ordered this book thinking that it was the full book however when it arrived I was surprised to see that it was only summaries of the chapters and points in the original book
I wished to return it but when I checked to print out the return sheet there was no way for me to return it I am sure the summaries are accurate and do provide a good synopsis of the text but I would like to be able to find that out myself and read the full text.
Book is ok but only provides a brief summary
Table of contents does not correspond to any pages.
I purchased two versions
This one is the real deal
Only if you are waging war is it relevant
However it is a classic and worth the read
It reminded me of Alinkski Rules for Radicals
Another waging war document
Ive heard about this book for many years
Its easy to understand why so many professionals beyond military Admirals and Generals apply Sun Tzus principles
There are many concepts that have application in sports business and politics
I love how it gets tight to the point
Very refreshing.
Great
 Well written
 Helpful in many professions.
Bought it for my girlfriend and after reading it she was inspired to go demand a k raise
Now I stole it from her and Im feeling ready to do battle
So far the book is a great read
It is very detailed and a most read for all
Unfortunately the copy I received was a little torn at the bottom of the first page but it is still readable.
This is not even  of the whole book
 This book is maybe  thick
 The real book was at least an inch thick
 Ive seen the real deal in bookstores after purchasing this
 Well played  Im not gonna ask for a refund for this cheap of an item  but Im sure not giving it a good rating.
This is an outstanding reference and handbook for strategies in war competition and personal growth
 A treasure chest of ancient and timeproven advice
Whats not to like Sun Tzu tells you all you need to know about war and how to win
 Apply it metaphorically and you win at life.
The book is deceiving it really is just an outline of the book about  pages.
Great classic book
It was shipped to me a little bent no worries
Ive read it before but I lost the book and wanted it for my collection
It is a good book for those who wonder of war
Hopefully we.will never jabe to use this in any war.
This is not the entire book
I dont know why it doesnt state that in the description
It has good information though
I keep a few copies to hand out to people for reference use.
Still widely revered and used today
I recommend this book to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of government military politics and even some organizations.
Very misleading this is not the actual book Buyer beware
This book reads almost like a bunch of Bible verses quite random segmented advice that is good not only for war but for life
Really quick read but tons of pro life tips.
This is a  pamphlet of Sun Tzus sayings with no  interpretation or analysis of his meaning
I was looking for something more indepth
Also the cover and description is not what I received
I believe all the items on Amazon are this pamphlet type.
Interesting reading.
Amazing and should be a must read for everyone
Tactics in all facets of life.
Great book
such a great read i had to buy it twice and give it away as a gift
The description was not clear that this is just basically a bullet point summary
NOT the full book
I didnt read the reviews.
Turns out this wasnt the book I thought it was
Its just an overview of the book
Smh..
alrrady in the garbage.
The ultimate handbook for anyone involved in competitive business entertainment finance
Really a great read and should be on the top  books any new businessperson should read.
I thought it would be thicker but I was in need of something to read
This book is the defacto standard for studying battle tactics
Its also a great book to study as a business owner as well.
Thought what I was buying was the full art of war book..
 it was not  just a cliff note...
Great book and fast read
Great read
Wasnt expecting this to be a flimsy book....
Great book
Very good life advise  for anyone
Definitely have to read more than once yo get the full gist
But would definitely recommend to helpwith discernment and decision making.
Did not enjoy
This book is awesome
Read it a couple times to fully understand it
Husband loves it
This version or translation is worse that the Kings James Translation of the Bible.
Great
I feel dumb for buying this
It is NOT the whole book just the cliff notes and only  pages long
Read the reviews so you dont make the same mistake.
Stop fighting
As Advertised
Wanted a copy love having in my collection mught replace with a hardback at some point
The large surface area with so few pages makes it a bit frustrating to keep in good condition for long although overall its presented very well
Not bad for the price
Recommended for your first time reading or a copy you can take anyway without worry.
Thought  it was a book but its only a long pamphlet.
I dont have anything new to say about this
Read it and think about how it applies to you
One more word was required.
Okay
Also made in large print to take up space
Very disappointed
Worthless bullet point summary
Cheap pamphlet
I thought it would be a lot bigger and in depth  book but its like an outline.
Product received is as described.
Can I give it  stars Lesson learned  Always read reviews
 Bad move Amazon.
I didnt know exactly what to expect from this book
This is as much of a philosophy book as it is on the stratagem of conducting a war
No battle scenes or gore
A quick read.
Too bad Obama never read it
 If he had ISIS would not have come into existence.
Good book
Like
My son loved this present he had read a part of it at uni but is now happy hes read the whole book.
though not my favorite book it was still worth the read
A good translation but just know that youre only ordering a ish page SUMMARY so dont get this if youre looking for the full text
Simple explanations and youre able to interpret many things past the described wartime situations
Theres quite a bit to take away from it.
It is a great book
Enjoy it.
Sons in jail n loves this book
Great
Loved this ancient book
I used it with problems at work.
Si recomendable
Wasnt the whole book so look in description
Should have known by the price.
Classic read great for anyone in biz
Its mostly just a book with quotes sayings
I was hoping for a shortened version of the art of war book its self.
Great read I highly recommend.
Fascinating strategies
Some concepts and strategies are even useful in situations we see at work and personal life
I really enjoyed it.
Not the full version
Do not buy this book
This is NOT the real book.
perfect to make you think about how you handle situations at home and work
 DOES NOT GIVE ANSWERS  Provokes thinking in another way.
good
My husband has wanted this book for a very long time
Good price and fast service.
Bought this as a gift and realized the print quality is just so so specially of the cover
 Its still decent if you are buying it to just read but not as a book to keep forever.
The best way to describe this is the Cliffs notes of The Art of War
Product is deceptive in the description
Thought I was getting the full book
Disappointed......
Bought as a gift
Classic strategic planning
My son loved this one
Very good.
Smooth reading and easy to listen to
Ill definitely be revisiting this title a few more times at least
Peace.
A most read
 It is short and reads like a book in the Old Testament
 A lot of wisdom.
Get what you paid for
The more your read it the more you get from the book
Great
This book is a great read
I would recommend this to a friend
It is really my new favorite a page turner.
Good
Fast and as advertised.
This book does not contain the full book
I used to have the paperback but lost it
This is not the same one.
Thank you
Got the book
Great condition
Its a summary of the original version
I like it
Short and sweet
Great book.
Very sparse translation I got this for a college class and thankfully I had another version
Theres no translator credited or publisher outside of Black and White Classics printed inside of it so citing this wouldnt have been fun
Theres a small intro and then the very basic translation
It actually came in handy when the other version of Art of War that i had got a little too verbose I was able to refer to this one to get it dumbed down a little but Im very glad I had the other copy to be able to quote cite and get more context for the class I am in.
Good read
Great read...
A must read for life lessons business start ups and actual war.
Excellent read
If you are looking for the cliff notes this is the book for you
If you actually want to read the full text look elsewhere.
Book arrived in good condition
It is basically just a listing of SunTzus principles
The cover art pictured was not what I received
I got cover art that just stated the title
Bookseller was good to deal with regarding this issue
Wish the book had some analysis or explanation or examples
No introduction verbiage nor back cover nor chapter verbiage.
This is a shortened version of the book but it doesnt tell you that so It was kinda a rip off
Not full book
Was advertised as full book but its more of an overview.
A very affordable price for a reprint of a classic
 It is much appreciated.
Same as always
Liked the organization by important concepts
 Good way to apply the info to my real life concerns
I believe this is required reading at our nations Military Academies
I found it fascinating.
For military..excellant
I read this book while in Ranger training in .
Fantastic book
Still very relatable today.
An amazing read.
This is the most informative book Ive read in a while
 Im very impressed
This Book is the biggest knock off Really disappointed in Amazon for allowing more and more knock offs to be sold on their site.
Great
Feel deceived I was a very abridged version
I guess its my own fault
The description should be more clear.
Even though im not done the book i still find it to be a very interesting read and do recommend it
Not eloquently written but great content.
Its a great book
Just a pamphlet
Do not buy.
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THIS WAS CONCISE VERSION
It is a must read if you like reading books old enough to be considered historic
this is a summary of the book very deceiving Read these reviews first
ok
nice translation straigh to the point
Youll be able to defeat anyone standing in your way after reading.
This is a  page summary of the book.
Classic book everyone should read.
I would have liked for the shirt to be all cotton and a heavier weight.
Love this book
Item as described and items were shipped quickly.
Thats not the edition I was expecting to receive
It seems like a watered down edition of The Art of War.
Not the full book
Only about  pages of commentary.
This book came brand new and its content is applicable to many areas of life
It can speak to where you plan to go
I love it
Very good
Nice little reference book
Great great book
This was not The Art of War
It is a book of quotes and snippets from the actual book.
Great read war is everywhere to be found this just goes deep into that and actual war
Great book.
Thanks
Good book
Like the easy read format.
Powerful book...
Its a cliff note version
i never ordered this version
very satisfied
Everyone should read.
I didnt like this version
Seems pretty chopped up.
Too little content in this abridged summary
This isnt the real book its a ripoff
Dont buy it.
Awesome little book
I am currently still reading it im half way through it
Its a great way to see into the mind of a great warrior
Coaching strategy
Purchased summary instead of full txt
Its not the actual book its just nonsense
My minisynopsis This book is quite literally a guide filled with tips on how to go to war
It was written by Sun Tzu who was a Chinese general in the Eastern Zhou period
The book gives very specific actionable tips on how to be sure that your army will win a war
It has become very popular in the business world because many of the tips for war can be translated to be helpful in running a successful business
It is a very short read but is a great look into the mind of an extremely successful general and gives great advice on how to build a successful army
Whether you are looking to win a war or win at business Sun Tzu says Opportunities multiply as they are seized
What I learned I learned many tips on how win a battle using fire and spies but even more about how to run a business
The point that I found came up the most was to be unexpected
Never use the same strategy twice if you are trying to beat someone
In terms of how to handle competition this is the best least aggressive strategy I found
Never do what people are expecting or you give them plenty of time to determine how they will defeat you
Additionally a point that stood out to be was how tactics are like water
You cant expect for a strategy that worked in one market to work just as well in another
Use it as a guide then be aware enough to allow the strategy to react to its surroundings like water down a mountain
The final point I will make is a point that I have seen mentioned over and over in many books from most of the successful leaders sans Jobs of course
Treat your people well He specifically mentions that before disciplining them or pushing them too hard they must fully trust you and be attached
Once again I am reminded that leaders lead by example which gives everyone the faith to trust them
Great quick read and now I feel like I need to go buy a samurai sword.
For the past  months I have been reading this astounding book called The Art of War
The Art of War has been changing the world around us for more than  years
It was written by a war strategist named Sun Tzu during his attempt to defend his country Wu from its larger neighbor Chu
According to The Life Guides a youtube channel
This remarkable book has inspired George Washington to find hope during the Revolutionary War it has also helped The United States of America and many other countries to defend against the Nazis and has inspired President Donald Trumps business strategies
This book has also changed me in some vital ways
Here are a few of them
First in karate I am able to use my energy so much more effectively by applying some tips from the book
For example the quotes appear where you are least expected when the enemy is taking rest give him none appear strong when you are weak   and avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak
This book has also helped me in my day to day life
I have learned how to manage my time and to prioritize what I use it for
This helps me to prevent from getting overwhelmed with work
I would recommend this book to a person who is willing to change himself for the better and who is willing to put in the effort to read it and understand it to its full extent
A couple of major questions raised by the book are Did Sun Tzu ever even write the Art of War Many historical facts suggest that Sun Tzu was not the original author and Is The Art of War fiction nonfiction or realistic fiction We will never know the book combines various genres and is subjective to the opinion of the reader
Sun Tzu spoke in complex and diverse riddles about war tactics how to be a great leader and more
His voice sounded wise but commanding and kept me hooked throughout the book
I wanted to keep reading the book and this is coming from someone who despises reading in general.
A great book with a wealth of knowledge and strategies that can be adapted for use in conflict ridden or adversarial situations in daily life
 This book is just as relevant today as it was centuries ago.
Avoid this copy
Is not noted by the publisher which source is used only that it is public domain
I do not believe they are following copyright laws even by stating just that
Look for a modern translation with a known author.
Diary of a wimpy kid is better.
This book is really a blessing to me
It really helped me a lot when it comes to important decision at my work and in my job that will matter the most in the future
I learned a a lot of new perspective when it comes to strategic planning to those of you who wants a wiser and safer decision in my this is the book thats right for you.
Thank you for this amazing addition to my collection Definitely recommend this seller  STAR
Great for business strategy and tactics
Excellent guide.
This version of the book is definitely not the one you are assuming
Fake cliffnote book.
Not the full version
Very thin book.
Basic yet complex
 Simple yet profound
 Timeless  yet relevant
 Best book ever.
I bought as a gift
It was well received
Easy to read
I really love this book
A classic
Pristine condition.
Amazing
Great common Sense is a great thing especially if it went through history and is still teaching valuable lessons with all that weve been throughgood job Sun Tzu .
I always wanted to give this book a go with all the references to it in pop culture etc
and seeing as its relatively cheap I just thought I would chuck it on to another order I was getting
First of all the book was far smaller than I expected it to be
Its very slim and the content on the pages is arranged into points with significant white space between each one
Maybe look up some images of the book to give yourself a better idea of what youre paying for
I personally find the points can be a little hard to digest which is understandable given that its translated from an older languageway of writing
Once you get past that though its a good and interesting read with many good points and Im glad I purchased it.
The art of this war is to get the enemy to read this book and send them all to sleep then attack
I have read the book before in its physical format
This ebook is not the full version of fhe book as it is much shorter  pages the full book is more than  pages
This product does not mention this fact anywhere
Scam
The real full book is really good
Just buy it from another provider.
If you can appreciate when this was written then you will understand the historical value of this book
A worthy read and a good place to start if you like war history.
Absolutely brilliant book
Some elements apply to all aspects of life
Very good book nice easy read
Recommend to everyone.
Bought for son seems pleased but hard to tell as he perminantly has head stuck in s book.
Eye opening  Im really glad I bought this now
Learnt far more than i expected and raced through it excellent

 Took  mins to read
Awesome book
Full of incredible quotes
Ideal to add to your library.
I liked the book the only downfall is the cover which isnt thick enough
The cover bends and stays in the shape its been in not very solid
Otherwise happy purchase
Worth the money.
Loved the book
Very thin and very basic
Bought this as a reminder to a business book I bought that had all of Sun Tzus principles in and this is a great little text
Not as detailed as the other book I had but a great manual to add your own take too.
Great read
The book is a testament to the writer
 once I started digging into this book I couldnt let it go
This book used to be banned long ago such a bless to have access to it.This says all
Enjoy 
Deep book still with good application to modern times teaching a military mind more should read this book as they say knowledge is power
Those interested in politics can learn from this those that are interested in warfare need to understand it even more
I find it difficult to understand.
Its a very good book it makes you think about strategies outside the box in every problem you face in life
Interesting and intriguing
 Applicable ideas and philosophy to other areas of life and relationships other than just war strategy.
If you buy this you know what you want and it deliverd.
Dislike being forced to write a review while reading the book
Destroyed my train of thought for no good reason.
Splendid and very thought provoking
Admittedly it was the Total War series that brought it to my attention.
V good
Great book insightful.
Great book
Fantastic Book
Not the actual book
Dont spend your money on this.
Great perspective
Very applicable for anybody who is looking to improve in sports.
Excellent
good book
The book came in excellent condition
Packaged well from seller
I would highly suggest that when reading this book that you find a quite place to read it
 You will want to emerse your entire focuss on the story and absorb all info
Its not the same read if your being interrupted all the time
Its a great quite time reading book you will get allot out of
I loved it and its now going on my coffee table
I will most definitely read this book again
Everyones perception of this book is different so therefore thats why i suggested a quite place to enjoy the book
Hope that helps and enjoy.

El libro es una adaptacin y adems es demasiado delgado como para considerarse un libro.

 Very disappointing.

It seems a bit to simple.
