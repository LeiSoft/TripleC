CC314		  Having said that even if we only had one model at our disposal it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate and by implication economic forecasts would have to be in the negative    What might we learn from climate forecastsThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	0

CC320		However in the long run with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change the opposite seems to hold : marginal benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO while marginal costs are fairly flatThis targetdriven approach to carbon pricing is now being followed in the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC   after several years of mixed experience in using the SCC beginning with     Estimating the social cost of carbon emissions Government Economic Service Working Paper The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	0

CC2300		One further possibility is suggested by the fact that both CD and CD can induce signalling by the inhibitory CTLA receptor on T cells as well as activating the CD pathway    therefore an inhibitory milieu may be propagated via the infected macrophageCo inhibitory molecules of the B CD family in the control of T cell immunityViral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl expression via ifn	1

CC2305		Further work will be required to fully assess this possibilityIn conclusion PDL expression is a primary response of monocytesmacrophages to viral infection whether that be in the liver   the blood    or the lung B H is up regulated in HIV infection and is a novel surrogate marker of disease progressionViral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl expression via ifn	0
CC2306		Moreover the role of IFNs in upregulating PDL is not confined to monocytesmacrophages as IFN and IFN have both been shown to increase expression of PDL in hepatocytes   PD L is induced in hepatocytes by viral infection and by interferon alpha and gamma and mediates T cell apoptosisViral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl expression via ifn	1
CC2307		The question remains as to why this host response mechanism in response to virus has developed and what its functional significance is ?

CC2314		Role of virusinduced IFN in PDL expressionSince type I IFN expression was observed in response to influenza infection and previous studies have suggested that these cytokines could induce PDL expression    we investigated whether rhIFN could induce PDL gene expression in our MDM model FigPDL   upregulation on monocytes and T cells by HIV via type I interferon restricted expression of type I interferon receptor by CCR expressing leukocytesViral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl expression via ifn	1

CC2318		However it was only recently that a role for this PDPDL pathway has been elucidated in the control of immune function in acute infections and increased PDL expression in response to pathogens was demonstrated to be crucial for impairment of CD cytotoxicity   and the development of regulatory T cells   The PDL PD axis converts human TH cells into regulatory T cellsViral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl expression via ifn	1
