I will define these two terms in the sense introduced by Risk Uncertainty and Profit  whereby the distinction turns on whether states of nature can be assigned precise probabilities  risk or not uncertainty or as it is often known nowadays ambiguity	1
In the present context this means that the decisionmaker focuses more on models yielding higher estimates of the SCC see also Ambiguity and climate policy Dietz and Heal 	1
Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met while the existence of a longrun quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty The Economics of Climate Change The Stern Review 	1
 Having said that even if we only had one model at our disposal it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate and by implication economic forecasts would have to be in the negative What might we learn from climate forecasts 	0

To take the DICE model as an example Warming the World Economic Models of Global Warming  it can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature together with the modellers specific coefficient values implies that global warming can reach more than C before the equivalent of  of global GDP is lost	1

Furthermore they also question the damage estimates of the models at low temperatures drawing on work by Michael What is the economic cost of climate change   that argues damages could also be significantly higher in this realm	0

One reason that people mindwander much more than they are aware of doing may be that mindwandering and the metaawareness of doing so engage some of the same brain structures such as the anterior prefrontal cortex so that when occupied by mindwandering these structures cannot also create awareness of the mindwandering  Metaawareness perceptual decoupling and the wandering mind et al 	0

These include a variety of mental processes including retrieval of past experiences and imagining future scenarios  The brain s default network et al  which are essential for planning and are also stock components of mindwandering sequencesRaichle  argues that the defaultmode network is not coextensive with conscious mindwandering citing the continuation of the networks activity into lighter states of anesthesia and Stages  and  of sleep  Horovitz et al  when dreaming is most frequent and the demonstration  Christoff et al  of executivenetwork elements during resting states	0

Perceptual decoupling may accordingly be part of a more extensive process that protects ongoing behavior see also Klinger Klinger   in regard to a meaningcomplex theory of response organization also behavioral chunking eg Taskrelevant chunking in sequence learning et al 	1
It thus appears that although the respondent components of mindwandering may depend on the defaultmode network they are far from the only activity supported by that networkWhen tasks make large demands on processing the necessary shift of mental resources from the defaultmode network to executive regions is harder to attain with advancing age  Age differences in deactivation a link to cognitive control  et al 	1
Also working memory capacity has been reported inversely associated with everyday mindwandering during resourcedemanding activities  Kane et al  positively related to proportionally prospective mindwandering during an undemanding task  Baird et al  but unrelated to proportionally prospective mindwandering during demanding tasks  Working memory capacity does not always support futureoriented mind wandering et al 	1

Furthermore it appears that negative moods tend to skew mindwandering toward past events  Imprisoned by the past unhappy moods lead to a retrospective bias to mind wandering Conscious and OConnor 	1

The terms operant versus respondent are taken from Science and Human Behaviors theory Science and Human Behavior  to refer to activity aimed at acquiring reinforcers or goals versus reflexive responses to stimuli here including ones own mental eventsVarious investigators have applied varying operational definitions to daydreaming such as thought consisting of fanciful content Freud  being independent of current task activity eg Singer  or being unintended and spontaneous ie respondent Klinger 	1
Early on Correlates of daydreaming a dimension of self awareness and Schonbar  had found that a psychometric selfreport measure of how much graduate students in education daydreamed correlated  with the degree of creativity the students displayed in their account of an actual daydream and in a spontaneous original story that they wrote	1
There are large individual differences in the amount of time that people desire to spend in imaginative daydreaming Personality and private experience individual variations in consciousness and in attention to subjective phenomena  Bigelsen and Schupak  some valuing it as a resource for selfamusement and stimulation and others eager to reduce or eliminate it but unable to attain a daydreamfree stateIf moving between innerdirected and outwarddirected states is a kind of automatic decision process there must be a switching mechanism that employs some set of criteria for making the switch	1

Again the point here is that encountering cues related in some way to ones goals takes higher processing priority over competing cues in a way that helps to explain the gravitation of undirected thought content to one or another of the individuals goalsOn the assumption that males are more likely than women to be concerned with power and hence be drawn to its cues Male susceptibility to attentional capture by power cues et al	0
