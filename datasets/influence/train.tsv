The break - down of scale invariance ( Ciuciu et al . , 2011Modulation of scale free properties of brain activity in MEG et al . , 2012 ) is tantamount to velocity changes . One possible way to represent this is to assume that brain dynamics makes steps between given locations of its phase space , in which it dwells for a certain time , and that times between two consecutive steps are characterized by a given waiting - time distribution ( WTD)Time scales in cognitive neuroscience	1
Spatial extension introduces not only dynamical heterogeneity , i.e. , a spatial distribution of time scales , but also time scales emerging from cooperative or competitive phenomena , which typically display regimes and unfold at scales different from those of spatially local components ( A fluctuating environment as a source of periodic modulation et al . , 2007b;Allegrini et al . , 2011)Time scales in cognitive neuroscience	1
Suitably modified versions of the FDT also hold for out - of - equilibrium systems ( Cugliandolo et al . , 1997;Violation of the fluctuationdissipation theorem in glassy systems basic notions and the numerical evidence and Ritort , 2003;Pottier and Mauger , 2004;Allegrini et al . , 2007;Aquino et al . , 2007).On the other hand , the FDT allows conceptualizing cognitive processes as fields acting upon brain activity ( Papo , 2013 ) , whose response and associated time scales can be studied using response theory ( Kubo , 1966)Time scales in cognitive neuroscience	1
The break - down of scale invariance ( Log wavelet leaders cumulant based multifractal analysis of EVI fMRI time series evidence of scaling in ongoing and evoked brain activity et al . , 2011Zilber et al . , 2012 ) is tantamount to velocity changes .

Thus The Sources of Economic Growth in the United States and the Alternatives Before Us Committee for Economic Development ( 1962 ) suggested that , at the level of working hours in 1929 ( when weekly working hours were 49 hours averaged over 52 weeks ) , a reduction in hours would be fully offset in gains that would leave output unchangedThe Productivity of Working Hours	1

Hence , according to this account , which emphasizes the role of the hippocampus as the sparring partner of the neocortex , sleep has the potential to make memories more accessible . In contrast , theories grounded in the notion of retroactive interference ( The psychology and neuroscience of forgetting , 2004 ; see also Mednick , Cai , Shuman , Anagnostaras , & amp ; The psychology and neuroscience of forgetting , 2011 ) insist that during slow - wave sleep synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is nullSleep not just protects memories against forgetting , it also makes them more accessible	1
However , as Intratrial and intertrial retention Notes towards a theory of free recall verbal learning ( 1964Intratrial and intertrial retention Notes towards a theory of free recall verbal learning ( , 1967 , amongst others , pointed out , this approach is inherently blind to fluctuations at the item - levelSleep not just protects memories against forgetting , it also makes them more accessible	1
By testing recall after intervals ranging between one and eight hours , these researchers found that the presence of sleep in the retention interval had a protective influence : forgetting curves were less steep for intervals filled with sleep than for those filled with active wake . Nine decades down the forgetting curves , the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established ( see Memory consolidation & amp ; Cai , 2014 , for a review)Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting , it also makes them more accessible	1
Thus , on the basis of these non - linear changes , we know that for the sleep group something akin to systems consolidation had been triggered ( e.g. , Shift from hippocampal to neocortical centered retrieval network with consolidation et al . , 2009).Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting , it also makes them more accessible	0
Given this concern , I re - analyzed the data from two published studies ( Dumay & amp ; Gaskell , 2007;Sleep spindle activity is associated with the integration of new memories and existing knowledge , Payne , Stickgold , Wamsley , & amp ; Gaskell , 2010;henceforth ' DG ' and ' TPSWG ' ) , that showed a positive effect of sleep on free recall under conditions in which performance was not constrained by the ceiling ( or the floor)Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting , it also makes them more accessible	1
According to the " active consolidation " account ( Diekelmann & amp ; Born , 2010 ) , sleep is key to memory consolidation because slow - wave sleep promotes " neural replay " ( Reactivation of hippocampal ensemble memories during sleep & amp ; McNaughton , 1994)Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting , it also makes them more accessible	1
To summarise , what can be witnessed is that , in line with institutional theory ( DiMaggio and Powell , 1983;Escape from the iron cage organizational change and isomorphic pressures in the public sector et al . , 2009;Lai et al . , 2006 ) , all the municipalities reported perceiving persuasive pressure to adopt personalisation measures , both from outside the set of potential adopters ( referring to norms to conform to citizens ' needs , or to be receptive towards national initiatives ) as well as from within the set of potential adopters ( referring to the norm to excel in relation to one 's peers)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0

Respondents from the municipalities reported that perceptions of persuasive pressure were followed by organisational searching and scanning activities , through which municipalities attempted to seek , identify and choose relevant knowledge , experiences and courses of action ( see also Levinthal and March , 1982;Managing innovation et al . , 2009)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0
In many western countries , it is especially local governments that are developing one - stop shops that serve as a point - of - entry to the whole range of government ( Ling , 2002;Ho , 2002;BeynonDavies and Martin , 2004;Joined up government past present and future , 2005 ) in such a way that the relationship between public sector organisations and citizens is re - engineered ( BeynonDavies and Martin , 2004)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0
( 1994 ) have stated that persuasion can occur both through vertical channels of communication ( initiated by actors outside the set of potential adopters , such as central government ; see also Leonard - Barton and Rogers , 1981;Can state government actions affect innovation and its diffusion An extended communication model and empirical test and Bretschneider , 1997;Bobrowski and Bretschneider , 1994 ) as well as through processes of mimicking and ' word - of - mouth ' diffusion ( Wang and Doong , 2010 ) involving communication , interaction and persuasion among potential adopters ( DiMaggio and Powell , 1983)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	1

A supposed characteristic of the ' final stage ' in these maturity models is that there is a seamless integration of information services across administrative boundaries . Recently , the idea of integration was further pushed by it being given strong support ( OECD , 2009 ) and the related academic discussion of personalised integrated services ( Transformational government The Role of Information Technology in Delivering Citizen Centric Local Public Services and Cotterill , 2007;Peterson et al . , 2007;Homburg and Dijkshoorn , 2011)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0
According to Circulating ideas Imitation translation and editing and Wedlin ( 2008;see also Silva and Hirscheim , 2007 ) , and in line with the Scandinavian Institutionalism mentioned in the discussion on theoretical antecedents of diffusion , knowledge and ideas can not simply be transfused from one organisation to the other : rather , ideas , concepts and knowledge has to be repackaged and re - embedded ( Isabella , 1990;MacDonald , 1995;Circulating ideas Imitation translation and editing and Wedlin , 2008)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0

Hence , institutionalism emphasises the persuasive control over the practices , beliefs and belief systems of individuals or organisations through an institution 's sway ( Issues in the Creation of Organizations Initiation Innocation and Institutionalization , 1979 , in King et al . , 1994Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0

In many western countries , it is especially local governments that are developing one - stop shops that serve as a point - of - entry to the whole range of government ( Ling , 2002;Reinventing local governments and the E government initiative , 2002;BeynonDavies and Martin , 2004;Mulgan , 2005 ) in such a way that the relationship between public sector organisations and citizens is re - engineered ( BeynonDavies and Martin , 2004)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0

Advancements in the discipline of organisational sociology in recent decades , such as the emergence of ' new institutionalism ' ( DiMaggio and Powell , 1983;The Institutionalization of Institutional Theory and Zucker , 1996 ) , have highlighted the significance of the professional and/or legal rules , cognitive structures , norms and the prevailing values in which innovation takes placeDiffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	1
In order to be able to explain the diffusion , we focus on a population of 441 potential adopters in a single national jurisdiction , the Netherlands , which can be seen as a decentralised unitary state ( Esping - Andersen , 1990;Public management reform A comparative analysis and Bouckaert , 2004)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	1

Our hope is that , by focusing on ' agency ' alongside ' structure ' ( Orlikowksi and Barley , 2001 ) , more light will be shed on the process of technological and organisational change ( The Awakening Giant , 1985 ) such that , eventually , the diffusion of egovernment will be better understoodDiffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0
Social integration mechanisms : translating and framing by actorsFrom fieldwork observations , and informed by our theoretical discussion of Scandinavian Institutionalism , we could see that translation , transfusion and repackaging of knowledge and ideas does not take place in a vacuum , but is a social integration process in which specific actors play a role ( Czarniawska and Sevon , 2005 ; see also Bridging User Organizations Knowledge Brokering and the Work of Information Technology Professionals and Robey , 2004)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0

Institutionalism holds that the adoption of innovations does not take place because individuals or ( private as well as public ) organisations make rational , calculated decisions regarding costs and benefits ( see , for instance , User acceptance of information technology Toward a unified view et al . , 2003 ) , but rather that:(1 ) decisions whether or not to adopt innovations are influenced by rules , conventions , principles , belief systems and social context criteria , and ( 2 ) attempt to shape and affect these overarching structures of norms , beliefs and rules that together form the concept of institutions .

Innovation through mimicry is likely to occur when innovations are socially visible ( Mahajan and Peterson , 1985;Dos Santos and Peffers , 1998 ) , when causes , conditions and consequences are known ( absence of causal ambiguity , Barney , 1991;Diffusion of information technology outsourcing influence sources and the Kodak effect and Venkatraman , 1992 ) and when the success of the innovation is unlikely to be determined by path dependencies ( Barney , 1991;Diffusion of information technology outsourcing influence sources and the Kodak effect and Venkatraman , 1992)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0

To summarise , what can be witnessed is that , in line with institutional theory ( DiMaggio and Powell , 1983;Ashworth et al . , 2009;Institutional isomorphism and the adoption of information technology for supply chain management et al . , 2006 ) , all the municipalities reported perceiving persuasive pressure to adopt personalisation measures , both from outside the set of potential adopters ( referring to norms to conform to citizens ' needs , or to be receptive towards national initiatives ) as well as from within the set of potential adopters ( referring to the norm to excel in relation to one 's peers)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0
Various authors have argued that various ' stages ' or ' levels of maturity ' can be discerned in electronic service delivery ( Developing fully functional E government A four stage model and Lee , 2001;Anderson and Henriksen , 2005 ) , ranging from public organisations offering one - way transmission of static information , through organisations offering online transactions , to organisations offering integrated services ( which incorporate information from sources external to the organisation and through which the citizen may interact in the first place)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	1
Second , the resource based view on the firm ( The competitive challenge strategies for industrial innovation and renewal , 1987;Zahra and George , 2002 ) suggests that the so - called appropriability regime ( the extent to which organisations are risk averse , or willing to accept ambiguities inherent in framing ) moderates the relationship between framing and eventual adoption of innovationsDiffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	1
( 1994 ) have stated that persuasion can occur both through vertical channels of communication ( initiated by actors outside the set of potential adopters , such as central government ; see also Leonard - Barton and Rogers , 1981;Moon and Bretschneider , 1997;Bobrowski and Bretschneider , 1994 ) as well as through processes of mimicking and ' word - of - mouth ' diffusion ( Does government effort or citizen word of mouth determine e government service diffusion   and Doong , 2010 ) involving communication , interaction and persuasion among potential adopters ( DiMaggio and Powell , 1983)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0

According to Sahlin and Wedlin ( 2008;see also Silva and Hirscheim , 2007 ) , and in line with the Scandinavian Institutionalism mentioned in the discussion on theoretical antecedents of diffusion , knowledge and ideas can not simply be transfused from one organisation to the other : rather , ideas , concepts and knowledge has to be repackaged and re - embedded ( Isabella , 1990 ; Learning to change an information perspective on learning in the organization , 1995;Sahlin and Wedlin , 2008)Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities : evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies	0

Perhaps unsurprisingly , the reality of carrying out benefit - cost analysis of federal regulations falls short of best practice , and it does not appear to be having a significant impact on many regulatory decisions , except higher - profile cases ( Has economic analysis improved regulatory decisions    2008)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	0
I will define these two terms in the sense introduced by Risk Uncertainty and Profit ( 1921 ) , whereby the distinction turns on whether states of nature can be assigned precise probabilities 3 ( risk ) or not ( uncertainty , or , as it is often known nowadays , ambiguity)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	1
In the present context , this means that the decision - maker focuses more on models yielding higher estimates of the SCC ( see also Ambiguity and climate policy , Dietz and Heal 2010)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	1
Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met , while the existence of a long - run quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty ( The Economics of Climate Change The Stern Review 2007)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	1
4 Having said that , even if we only had one model at our disposal , it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty , and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate ( and by implication economic forecasts ) would have to be in the negative ( What might we learn from climate forecasts 2002)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	0
This seems remarkable , since , for example , such temperatures are likely to test the limits of human physiology ( An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress 2010)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	0
To take the DICE model as an example ( Warming the World Economic Models of Global Warming ) , it can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature , together with the modellers ' specific coefficient values , implies that global warming can reach more than 18C before the equivalent of 50 % of global GDP is lostThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	1
A recent paper by Ackerman and Stanton ( 2011 ) attempts to answer it using the DICE model , applying a functional form proposed by GHG targets as insurance against catastrophic climate damages ( 2010)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	1
Furthermore , they also question the damage estimates of the models at low temperatures , drawing on work by Michael What is the economic cost of climate change   ( 2008 ) that argues damages could also be significantly higher in this realmThe Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	0
Using recent reviews of the literature , we concluded that the range of estimates of the present SCC was a factor of ten larger than the corresponding range of estimates of the present MAC ( Environmental prices uncertainty and learning 2010).The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	1
However , in the long run , with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change , the opposite seems to hold : marginal benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO2 , while marginal costs are fairly flat . This target - driven approach to carbon pricing is now being followed in the UK ( Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) 2008 ) , after several years of ( mixed ) experience in using the SCC ( beginning with Estimating the social cost of carbon emissions Government Economic Service Working Paper 140   2002)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	0
With some trepidation , I will do likewise . In outlining the second assumption , note that simple averaging runs counter to most economic research on ambiguity , which shows that individuals are averse to ambiguity ( as summarised in Recent development in modeling preferences uncertainty and ambiguity 1992)The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis	0

The semantic halo ( Lewis , 1967 ) of the word " outcomes"For many outside any health service it would seem axiomatic that they would be interested in the results of their ministrations and the fact that this is clearly not the case even in orthopaedics where " The End Result Idea " originated ( Historical perspective Ernest Amory Codman 1869 1940 A pioneer of evidence based medicine the end result idea & amp ; Weinstein , 1998 ) , is a mystery beyond the reach of this paperRoutine Mental Health Outcome Measurement in the UK Running title : RCOM in the UK	1

This approach is rooted in dynamical approaches to coordination that are levelagnostic , seeking to understand emergent phenomena at one level ( e.g. , the dyad ) as arising through processes of self - organization from the constrained interaction of autonomous components at a lower level ( the speaker / listeners ) ( Dynamic Patterns , 1995;Latash , 2008)Voice , ( inter-)subjectivity , and real time recurrent interaction	1

Also in Petunia hybrida , the single SYP51 gene cloned up to now ( Faraco , 2011 ) seems to define in petal epidermal cells a very well defined vacuolar compartments separated from the central vacuole and already observed with other vacuolar markers ( Agrobacteriummediated transient expression of vacuolar GFPs in Petunia leaves and petals et al . , 2008).Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	1
From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast , it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to different V - ATPase subunits , influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting , or inhibiting , the lipid reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore ( The V ATPase proteolipid cylinder promotes the lipid mixing stage of SNARE dependent fusion of yeast vacuoles et al . , 2011)Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	1
Regulating t - SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response ( Asymmetric localization of Arabidopsis SYP124 syntaxin at the pollen tube apical and sub apical zones is involved in tip growth et al . , 2010;Yang et al . , 2012)Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	1
Vesicles do not preferentially target these microdomains . Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain protein clustering in micro - domains and the t - SNARE distribution seems to depend both on lipidic and proteic contributions ( Secretory vesicles are preferentially targeted to areas of low molecular SNARE density et al . , 2012)Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	1
The recent investigation of SYP5s i - SNARE effect ( De Benedictis et al . , 2012 ) may help to discover the molecular mechanisms of this process . A mechanism for the i - SNARE effect of yeast Qc - SNAREs is described by the competition between endosomal ( Tlg1 and Syn8 ) and vacuolar form ( Vam7 ) of the proteins ( Distinct contributions of vacuolar Qabcand R SNARE proteins to membrane fusion specificity et al . , 2012 ) and because of their ability to interact with V - ATPase subunits influencing membrane potential ( Strasser et al . , 2011)Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	0
SNARE ABUNDANCE AND INFLUENCE OF DISTRIBUTION ON THEIR FUSOGENIC ROLESNAREs are relatively small polypeptides ( 200 - 400 - amino - acids ) characterized by the presence of a particular domain , the SNARE motif ( SNAREs engines for membrane fusion and Scheller , 2006 ) , consisting of heptad repeats that can form a coiled - coil structureDefining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	0
Overexpression of DN variants to inhibit specific functions seems to offer a better tool to affect the molecular machinery leaving no options to the plant cell to adapt and mask the effect ( Rehman et al . , 2008;Silva et al . , 2010;Protein trafficking to the cell wall occurs through mechanisms distinguishable from default sorting in tobacco et al . , 2011;De Benedictis et al . , 2012).Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	1

Little attention is generally paid to the need of the cell to keep very similar compartments separated , because this need may not be evident among endosomes as much as among larger vacuolar structures typical of only few plant cells ( Two functionally different vacuoles for static and dynamic purposes in one plant mesophyll leaf cell et al . , 2004;Verweij et al . , 2008)Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	1
The equilibrium between fusogenic ( tSNARE ) and non fusogenic ( i - SNARE ) activity of specific SNAREs may reside on their localization , as highlighted for SYP51 and SYP52 ( De Benedictis et al . , 2012 ) but also on the formation of " clusters " in cholesterol - containing microdomains ( Anatomy and dynamics of a supramolecular membrane protein cluster et al . , 2006Anatomy and dynamics of a supramolecular membrane protein cluster et al . , , 2007).SYP5s will act as t - SNARE when present on the membrane of TGN or late endosomes and PVC , whereas they will behave as i - SNARE when accumulating on tonoplast ( Figure 1)Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	1
SNAREs also interact with several proteins acting as regulators of SNARE - complex formation ( Lobingier and Merz , 2012;The binding of Varp to VAMP7 traps VAMP7 in a closed fusogenically inactive conformation et al . , 2012).Defining new SNARE functions : the i - SNARE	0

Laboratory - based dream research has been based , from its early beginnings ( e.g. , The relation of eye movements during sleep to dream activity an objective method for the study of dreaming and Kleitman , 1957 ) , on an approach that combines physiological measurement ( EEG and other markers ) with subjective dream reportsMethodological considerations for the neurophenomenology of dreaming : commentary on Windt 's " Reporting dream experience "	1

There were a number of partial precedents for these findings : SITs associated with medial prefrontal cortex ( McGuire et al . , 1996 ) , similarity in activation patterns during rest and semantic retrieval ( Binder et al . , 1999 ) , increased task difficulty leading ( a ) to increased deactivation of some regions associated with the default - mode network ( A parametric manipulation of factors affecting task induced deactivation in functional neuroimaging , 2003 ) and ( b ) to decreased self - reported TUTs ( McKiernan et al . , 2006)Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams : basic principles	0
This debate has been most recently summarized by Smallwood ( 2013a ) , who has also suggested a resolution among four main viewpoints : the goal theory of current - concerns ( e.g. , Meaning and Void Inner Experience and The Incentives in People s Lives ,   and the sections above ) , decoupling from perception ( e.g. , Smallwood , 2011Smallwood , , 2013a , executive control failure ( e.g. , McVay and Kane , 2009 , 2010 , 2012a , and metaawareness ( Schooler et al . , 2011 : becoming conscious of one 's mind - wandering , a self - regulatory process)Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams : basic principles	0
One reason that people mind - wander much more than they are aware of doing may be that mind - wandering and the metaawareness of doing so engage some of the same brain structures , such as the anterior prefrontal cortex , so that when occupied by mind - wandering these structures can not also create awareness of the mind - wandering ( Metaawareness perceptual decoupling and the wandering mind et al . , 2011)Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams : basic principles	0

The fact that these participants chose some unrewarded trials is consistent with having a need for freer mental activity , as in mind - wandering , and the shift toward more unrewarded trials when the wages for rewarded , demanding trials decreased indicates that mind - wandering decreases when there is more at stake in the assigned task .

These include a variety of mental processes , including retrieval of past experiences and imagining future scenarios ( The brain s default network et al . , 2008 ) , which are essential for planning and are also stock components of mind - wandering sequences .

It thus appears that although the respondent components of mind - wandering may depend on the default - mode network , they are far from the only activity supported by that network .

The terms operant versus respondent are taken from Science and Human Behavior 's theory ( Science and Human Behavior , 1935 ) to refer to activity aimed at acquiring reinforcers ( or goals ) versus reflexive responses to stimuli , here including one 's own mental events . Various investigators have applied varying operational definitions to daydreaming , such as thought consisting of fanciful content ( Freud , 1953 ) , being independent of current task activity ( e.g. , Singer , 1966 ) , or being unintended and spontaneous , i.e. , respondent ( Klinger , 1971)Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams : basic principles	1
Early on , Correlates of daydreaming a dimension of self awareness and Schonbar ( 1961 ) had found that a psychometric , self - report measure of how much graduate students in education daydreamed correlated 0.48 with the degree of creativity the students displayed in their account of an " actual daydream " and in a " spontaneous , original story " that they wroteGoal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams : basic principles	1
There are large individual differences in the amount of time that people desire to spend in imaginative daydreaming ( Personality and private experience individual variations in consciousness and in attention to subjective phenomena ; Bigelsen and Schupak , 2011 ) , some valuing it as a resource for self - amusement and stimulation and others eager to reduce or eliminate it but unable to attain a daydream - free state . If moving between inner - directed and outward - directed states is a kind of automatic decision process , there must be a switching mechanism that employs some set of criteria for making the switchGoal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams : basic principles	1
( 2007 ) also found significant correlations during well - practiced tasks between fMRI readings of activation in six regions of the default - mode network and scores on the daydreaming frequency scale of the Imaginal Processes Inventory ( IPI ; Daydreaming imaginal processes and personality a normative study and Antrobus , 1972 ) , a self - report psychometric measure of the individual 's typical inner experienceGoal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams : basic principles	1
Again , the point here is that encountering cues related in some way to one 's goals takes higher processing priority over competing cues in a way that helps to explain the gravitation of undirected thought content to one or another of the individual 's goals .

This ( formal ) correspondence between complex instances and simpler manifestations of a problem seems to match well with an observation from problem - solving and reasoning experiments with human participants : Different forms of reductions from complex to simpler ( but still solution - equivalent ) problems are reported to be pervasive and crucial in many human problem solving scenarios ( see , e.g. Cognitive Psychology and Its ImplicationsIntuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	0
A growing number of researchers in these fields argues that humans in their common sense reasoning do not apply any full - fledged form of logical or probabilistic ( and thus intractable ) reasoning to possibly highly complex problems , but rather rely on mechanisms that reduce the latter to equivalent , simpler ones ( see , e.g. , Heuristics The Foundation of Adaptive BehaviorIntuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	0

SOME HISTORY In order to begin the discussion of the systematic and predictable errors in reasoning , Iwill introduce the study of statistical reasoning - e.g. , probabilistic inference ( BarHillel 1973 , Chapman and Chapman 1967 , 1969 , Edwards et al 1968 , Epley et al 2004 , Epley and Golivoch 2001 , Evans 1977 , Perceived Frequency of Concrete and Abstract Words and Underwood 1973 , Hogarth 1975 , Mans 1970 , Rips 1975 , Savage 1971 , Stal von Holstein 1971Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	0
Since this assumption might be faulty - as in the expert - novice example above - the practice of identifying intuitive responses , or System 1 responses in general , by reaction times ( Reasoning the Fast and Frugal Way Models of Bounded Rationality and Goldstein 1996 ) might be subject to a kind of misattribution error . Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	1
First , Gigerenzer and colleagues introduce their audience to a series of strategies , each of which is " biased " to varying degrees , that can be used to make estimations under conditions of uncertainty - e.g. , the " take the best " strategy ( Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996 ) inspired by statistical models using " equal weights " or " tallying " strategies ( Dawes 1974 , Dawes and Corrigan 1974 , Einhorn and Hogarth 1975 , The Relative Efficiency of Regression and Simple Unit Predictor Weights in Applied Differential Psychology 1971Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	0

In an effort to highlight reasoning that might be isomorphic to philosophical reasoning , I will turn to logical reasoning - e.g. , deductive and conditional reasoning - the study of which has revealed further systematic errors in reasoning ( Barwise 1993 , Bell and Johnson - Laird-1998 , Bonatti 1994 , Cummins 1991 , The Role of Implicit and Explicit Negation in Conditional Reasoning Bias Clibbens and Rood 1996 , The Role of Implicit and Explicit Negation in Conditional Reasoning Bias , Dugan and Revlin 1990 , Hardman and Payne 1995 , JohnsonLaird 1999 , Johnson - Laird and Byrne 2002 , Shynkaruk and Thompson 2006 , Thompson 2010 , Turner and Thompson 2009 , Wetherick and Golhooly 1990.Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	1
This might be unsurprising given that reasoners with higher levels of analytic intelligence - perhaps those who have enjoyed philosophical training and selection - will tend to respond reflectively on various reasoning tasks ( McCelroy andSeta 2003 , Individual Differences in Reasoning Implications for the Rationality Debate   andWest 2000)Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	1
There are a variety of views about why this is the case , but there is some evidence that implicit bias at various stages in the undergraduate , graduate , and career - level training and selection processes could result in fewer opportunities for advancement for women ( Paxton Figdor andTiberius 2012 , Occupational Segregation and Gender Inequality in Job Quality A Multi Level Approach andYaish 2014)Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	1

Perhaps this is why philosophers will argue , explicitly or implicitly , that premises can be considered true or false in virtue of their intuitive appeal - viz . , the premise just seems to be true or false ( Audi 2004 , Bealer 1998 , Huemer 2005 , Defending the Evidential Value of Epistemic Intuitions A Reply to Stich 2007Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	1
While there are nuanced differences between certain dual - process theories , dual - process theories are those which claim that one can distinguish between at least two cognitive strategies in reasoning , learning , deciding , etc.-I emphasize that there might be more than two processes to avoid problems that result from positing " binary oppositions " ( You Can t Play 20 Questions with Nature and Win Projective Comments on the Papers of This Symposium 1973)Intuitive and Reflective Responses in Philosophy	1

This is an important intuition about performance measurement and incentive - plan design .

Given the negative effects of thresholds , why are they used ? One reason is that they may allow the firm to use a stronger incentive intensity while keeping expected compensation at competitive rates or avoiding risks of high turnover in years when uncontrollable risk yields low performance ( A Theory of Sales Quotas with Limited Liability and Rent Sharing 2000;Murphy 2001)Design and implementation of pay for performance	1

Cos ( ) is the cosine of the angle between the vectors |p| and |q| , a measure of the extent to which the marginal products of effort on the performance measure match those on output ( Datar , Kulp & amp ; Lambert 2001;Distortion and Risk in Optimal Incentive Contracts 2002;Feltham & amp ; Xie 1994)Design and implementation of pay for performance	0
The purpose of this chapter is not to provide yet another survey , but to use the lessons of the economic literature on incentives to discuss how to design and implement pay for performance in practice .

Degrading of Performance Measures An interesting implication of distortion and manipulability is that numeric performance measures may degrade over time ( An Empirical Investigation of Gaming Responses to Explicit Performance Incentives ; Marschke 2004 , 2008Design and implementation of pay for performance	0
More recent empirical work ( An Empirical Analysis of Risk Incentives and the Delegation of Worker Authority ; Kurtulus 2010 ; Barrenechea - Mndez , Ortin - ngel & amp ; Rodes - Mayor Eduardo 2011 ) does find incentives tend to be stronger when the employee has more controllable risk , and weaker when he has more uncontrollable risk . Controllability is a term the managerial accounting literature has used , but not rigorously defined , for many yearsDesign and implementation of pay for performance	0
Finally , subjective evaluations have their own form of uncontrollable risk for the employee : they are difficult to verify and enforce contractually , so they require relational contracting and adequate trust of the supervisor ( Subjective Performance Measures in Optimal Incentive Contracts , Gibbons & amp ; Murphy 1994).Because virtually all jobs use subjectivity , it must have some benefitsDesign and implementation of pay for performance	0
Cos ( ) is the cosine of the angle between the vectors |p| and |q| , a measure of the extent to which the marginal products of effort on the performance measure match those on output ( Datar , Kulp & amp ; Lambert 2001;Baker 2002;Performance Measure Congruity and Diversity in Multi Task Principal Agent Relations & amp ; Xie 1994)Design and implementation of pay for performance	1

One can make many arguments for the utility of developing cognitive models within a cognitive architecture ( see , for example , Newell , 1990 , andAbility breadth and parsimony in computational models of higher order cognition et al . , 2008 ) , but adopting the concept of cognitive architecture is in fact highly consistent with Marr 's original approach to visionBeyond Single - Level Accounts : The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation	1
Again , Marr ( 1982 ) makes this point , citing Aspects of the Theory of Syntax 's distinction between linguistic competence and linguistic performance within transformational grammar ( Aspects of the Theory of Syntax , 1965 ) as corresponding to the difference between a CL explanation and an ARL one , with performance factors modulating the competence theoryBeyond Single - Level Accounts : The Role of Cognitive Architectures in Cognitive Scientific Explanation	1

But could one not study the operation of the brain directly with neuroscience evidence alone ?

Introduction The conceptualisation , operationalisation and assessment of the work - related psychological health of clergy is a matter that seems to be commanding increasing attention within the fields of pastoral psychology ( Charlton , Rolph , The relationship between work related psychological health and psychological type among clergy serving in the Presbyterian Church USA , Rolph , & amp ; Robbins , 2009 ) and empirical theology ( The relationship between work related psychological health and psychological type among clergy serving in the Presbyterian Church USA , Wulff , & amp ; Robbins , 2008)Work - Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church ( USA ): Testing the Idea of Balanced Affect	0
In an attempt to bring greater scientific objectivity to the conceptualisation and assessment of clergy work - related psychological health , a number of studies have employed the The Maslach Burnout Inventory Burnout Inventory ( MBI ) established by The Maslach Burnout Inventory and Jackson ( 1996)Work - Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church ( USA ): Testing the Idea of Balanced Affect	1
Challenging Maslach 's three dimensional model of burnout , Francis , Kaldor , Robbins , and Castle ( 2005 ) argued that a more empirically economic and theoretically coherent model of clergy work - related psychological health could be developed from The structure of psychological well being(1969 ) classic notion of ' balanced affect ' , according to which positive affect and negative affect are not opposite ends of a single continuum , but two separate continuaWork - Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church ( USA ): Testing the Idea of Balanced Affect	1
A series of studies has reported findings employing this modified form of the Maslach Burnout Inventory in the United Kingdom among Roman Catholic priests engaged in parochial ministry ( Francis , Louden , & amp ; Rutledge , 2004;Francis , Turton , & amp ; Louden , 2007 ) and among Anglican parochial clergy ( Francis & amp ; Rutledge , 2000;Francis & amp ; Turton , 2004a , 2004bExamining the relationship between burnout and age among Anglican clergy in England and Wales , 2004Examining the relationship between burnout and age among Anglican clergy in England and Wales , 2007Rutledge , 2006;Turton & amp ; Francis , 2007)Work - Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church ( USA ): Testing the Idea of Balanced Affect	0
In particular , the negative side concerning the expression and implications of poor work - related psychological health has been reflected in a series of arresting titles , like Ministry burnout ( Sanford , 1982 ) , Clergy stress : The hidden conflicts in ministry ( Coate , 1989 ) , Clergy under stress ( Fletcher , 1990 ) , Burnout : Stress in ministry ( Davey , 1995 ) , Healthy clergy : Wounded healers ( Walmsley & amp ; Lummis , 1997),Between two worlds : Understanding and managing clergy stress ( Irvine , 1997 ) , Burnout in church leaders ( Kaldor & amp ; Bullpit , 2001 ) , The cracked pot : The state of today 's Anglican parish clergy ( Warren , 2002 ) , and Clergy burnout ( Clergy burnout Recovering from the 70 hour work week and other self defecting practices , 2006)Work - Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church ( USA ): Testing the Idea of Balanced Affect	0
The notion of the lie scale has not , however , remained as simple as that , and their continued use has resulted in them being interpreted as a personality measure in their own right Social desirability scales More substance than style;Furnham , 1986)Work - Related Psychological Health Among Clergy Serving in The Presbyterian Church ( USA ): Testing the Idea of Balanced Affect	0

Developmental trajectories of psychotic like experiences across adolescence impact of victimization and substance use , CastellanosRyan and Conrod ( 2011 ) found that distinct developmental trajectories can be identified in adolescent PLE , with " persistent " and " increasing " subclasses predicted by victimization and substance usePrevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Other PLE dimensions have been labeled as persecutory ideas , bizarre experiences and magical thinking ( Psychotic like experiences in a community sample of adolescents Implications for the continuum model of psychosis and prediction of schizophrenia , Nelson , Baker , Buckby , Baksheev & amp ; Cosgrave , 2009 ) , or delusions , paranoia , grandiosity and paranormal beliefs ( Wigman , Van Winkel , Raaijmakers et al . , 2011a)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	0
In contrast to the transient AVH , persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in longitudinal studies ( De Loore , Gunther , Drukker et al . , 2011 ) , and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in younger age groups ( Clinicopathological significance of psychotic experiences in non psychotic young people Evidence from four population based studies , Keeley , Corcoran et al . , 2012b)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
The studies examining the prevalence of AVH in the general adult population have given varying estimates ( Nuevo , Chatterji , Verdes , Naidoo , Arango & amp ; Ayuso - Mateos , 2012 ) with a median estimate of 4 - 5 % ( A systematic review and meta analysis of the psychosis continuum Evidence for a psychosis pronenesspersistence impairment model of psychotic disorder , Linscott , Myin - Germeys , Delespaul & amp ; Krabbendam , 2009)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Childhood trauma has also been shown to increase the risk for having AVH in adult age ( Daalman , Diederen , Derks , van Lutterveld , Kahn & amp ; Sommer , 2012;Janssen , Krabbendam , Bak et al . , 2004 ) and may also explain the higher rate of AVH in females as this is more often reported by females ( Daalman et al . , 2012;Janssen et al . , 2004;Psychopathology childhood sexual abuse and other childhood adversities Relative links to subsequent suicidal behaviour in the US , Berkman & amp ; Buka , 2001).Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	0
Childhood trauma has also been shown to increase the risk for having AVH in adult age ( Janssen , Krabbendam , Bak et al . , 2004 ) and may also explain the higher rate of AVH in females as this is more often reported by females ( Childhood trauma and auditory verbal hallucinations et al . , 2012Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Females in this age group report higher levels of depression ( Lundervold , Breivik , Posserud , Stormark & amp ; Hysing , 2013;Nolen - Hoeksema & amp ; Girgus , 1994;Emotional and behavioural antecedents of young adults who screen positive for non affective psychosis A 21 year birth cohort study , Scott , Williams et al . , 2009 ) indicating that they expericence a higher stress level which could account for their having more stressful AVHPrevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	0

By contrast , a slight ( albeit non - significant ) difference with girls reporting more hallucinations than boys has been reported ( Diagnostic outcome of self reported hallucinations in a community sample of adolescents , Ferdinand , Van der Ende , Hofstra & amp ; Verhulst , 2002)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
In general non - clinical populations , women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms ( Maric , Krabbendam , Vollebergh , de Graaf & amp ; Van Os , 2003 ) , and specifically auditory hallucinations ( Shevlin , Murphy , Dorahy & amp ; Adamson , 2007;Distribution of hallucinations in the population , 1991)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Childhood trauma has also been shown to increase the risk for having AVH in adult age ( Daalman , Diederen , Derks , van Lutterveld , Kahn & amp ; Sommer , 2012;Childhood abuse as a risk factor for psychotic experiences , Krabbendam , Bak et al . , 2004 ) and may also explain the higher rate of AVH in females as this is more often reported by females Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	0
In young adults ( age 18 - 24 ) , a similar tendency for women reporting higher levels of hallucinations has been found ( Demographic correlates of psychotic like experiences in young Australian adults , Welham , Martin et al . , 2008)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
However , AVH and voice - hearing may also occur without an accompanying psychotic disorder ( Healthy individuals with auditory verbal hallucinations who are they Psychiatric assessments of a selected sample of 103 subjects , Daalman , Rietkerk et al . , 2010a ) , and lie on a continuum from psychotic hallucinations to normal perceptual experiences ( see e.g. , Lari , 2012)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
It has been demonstrated that a self - report questions on AVH have a positive predictive value of 71.4 % ( as well as a negative predictive value of 90.4 % ) for interview - verified AVH experiences in adolescent samples ( Are screening instruments valid for psychotic like experiences A validation study of screening questions for psychotic like experiences using in depth clinical interview Harley , Murtagh & amp ; Cannon , 2011;see also Horwood , Salvi , Thomas et al . , 2008)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Finally , socioeconomic variables have been suggested as possible modulatory variables on the expression of PLE ( Socio economic disadvantage and delusional like experiences A nationwide population based study , Scott , Varghese & amp ; McGrath , 2013;Scott , Chant , Andrews & amp ; McGrath , 2006)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
In clinical samples , rates of auditory hallucinations have been suggested to be higher in female patients ( Rector & amp ; Seeman , 1992;Hallucinations in the acute schizophrenic type psychosis Effects of gender and age of illness onset , Dowd & amp ; Janicak , 1999 ) , although there are many confounding variables which may account for apparent gender differences ( e.g. , sampling biases , comorbid depression , etc.)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Also , we hypothesized that the prevalence of AVH would be influenced by age , with the lowest prevalence in the oldest age group . Finally , socioeconomic variables have been suggested as possible modulatory variables on the expression of PLE ( Saha , Psychotic like experiences in the general community The correlates of CIDI psychosis screen items in an Australian sample , Varghese & amp ; McGrath , 2013;Psychotic like experiences in the general community The correlates of CIDI psychosis screen items in an Australian sample , Chant , Andrews & amp ; McGrath , 2006)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
AVH were in most cases transient , whereas the persistence of AVH or transition to psychosis was suggested to be related to the severity of the hallucinatory experience ( Examining the course of hallucinatory experiences in children and adolescents a systematic review et al . , 2012).Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Hormones , in particular estrogens , have been suggested as a factor which modulates the onset and symptomatology of psychotic disorders ( Psychopathology in women and men Focus on female hormones , 1997)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	0
Further , Dissecting auditory verbal hallucinations into two components Audibility Gedankenlautwerden and alienation , Selten , Diederen and Blom ( 2010b ) suggest that the audibility component , independent of content and appraisal , should be considered separately as an important perceptual component of AVHs and reflects the neural pathophysiology underlying AVHPrevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
In general non - clinical populations , women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms ( Maric , Krabbendam , Vollebergh , de Graaf & amp ; Van Os , 2003 ) , and specifically auditory hallucinations ( The distribution of positive psychosis like symptoms in the population A latent class analysis of the National Comorbidity Survey , Murphy , Dorahy & amp ; Adamson , 2007;Tien , 1991)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Factor analyses of the LSHS have shown that while both of the items used in the present study load on an underlying " auditory hallucinations " factor ( Lari & amp ; Van Der Linden , 2005;Prevalence and dimensionality of hallucination like experiences in young adults , Sisti , Rocchi et al . , 2014 ) , the item addressing being troubled by the voices has also been found to load on a factor associated with psychopathology ( Aleman , Nieuwenstein , B ocker & amp ; De Haan , 2001;Waters , Badcock & amp ; Maybery , 2003 ) , and has been associated with higher degree of negative emotionality ( Lari & amp ; Van Der Linden , 2005Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Previous studies from the Bergen Child Study have shown that there is a selection bias where non - responders have a slightly higher rate of mental health problems , but with low effect sizes and minimal effect on mean estimates ( Predicting nonresponse bias from teacher ratings of mental health problems in primary school children , Heiervang , Heimann , Lundervold & amp ; Gillberg , 2008)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
The two AVH items used in the current study have shown strongest loading on the AVH factor ( Lari et al . , 2004;Hallucination like experiences in the nonclinical population , Lari , Cella , Raballo , Petretto & amp ; Preti , 2012)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
However , the subtypes have also a differential risk for distress and poor functioning , and hallucinations are among the subtypes with the strongest risk ( Evidence for a persistent environmentdependent and deteriorating subtype of subclinical psychotic experiences A 6 year longitudinal general population study et al . , 2011a;Yung et al . , 2009)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	0
In clinical samples , rates of auditory hallucinations have been suggested to be higher in female patients ( Auditory hallucinations in women and men ; Seeman , 1992;Sharma , Dowd & amp ; Janicak , 1999 ) , although there are many confounding variables which may account for apparent gender differences ( e.g. , sampling biases , comorbid depression , etc.)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	0
Factor analyses of the LSHS have shown that while both of the items used in the present study load on an underlying " auditory hallucinations " factor ( Lari & amp ; Van Der Linden , 2005;Preti , Sisti , Rocchi et al . , 2014 ) , the item addressing being troubled by the voices has also been found to load on a factor associated with psychopathology ( Multi dimensionality of hallucinatory predisposition Factor structure of the Launay Slade Hallucination Scale in a normal sample , Nieuwenstein , B ocker & amp ; De Haan , 2001;Waters , Badcock & amp ; Maybery , 2003 ) , and has been associated with higher degree of negative emotionality ( Lari & amp ; Van Der Linden , 2005 Note : For parental education , the percentage of " do n't know " responses is omitted from the tablePrevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
It is not yet clear , however , whether AVHs specifically increase the risk of schizophrenia - spectrum disorders , or whether they represent a non - specific indicator for vulnerability to psychiatric disorders ( Dhossche et al . , 2002;Specificity of childhood psychotic symptoms for predicting schizophrenia by 38 years of age A birth cohort study , Caspi , Poulton et al . , 2013;Welham et al . , 2009)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
In general non - clinical populations , women have been found to have higher incidence of positive psychotic symptoms ( Sex differences in symptoms of psychosis in a non selected general population sample , Krabbendam , Vollebergh , de Graaf & amp ; Van Os , 2003 ) , and specifically auditory hallucinations ( Shevlin , Murphy , Dorahy & amp ; Adamson , 2007;Tien , 1991)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Females in this age group report higher levels of depression ( Symptoms of depression as reported by Norwegian adolescents on the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire , Breivik , Posserud , Stormark & amp ; Hysing , 2013;Nolen - Hoeksema & amp ; Girgus , 1994;Welham , Scott , Williams et al . , 2009 ) indicating that they expericence a higher stress level which could account for their having more stressful AVHPrevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Also , depressive mood has also been shown to increase the risk of transition to psychosis in individuals with hallucinatory experiences ( Development of depressed mood predicts onset of psychotic disorder in individuals who report hallucinatory experiences , Myin - Germeys , Hanssen et al . , 2005)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
In a systematic review of 19 studies , Prevalence of psychotic symptoms in childhood and adolescence A systematic review and meta analysis of populationbased studies   reported a median prevalence of psychotic symptoms ( predominantly assessed as hearing voices ) to be 17 % in general childhood samples ( ages 9 - 12 ) and 7.5 % in adolescent samples ( ages [ 13][14]Prevalence of psychotic symptoms in childhood and adolescence A systematic review and meta analysis of populationbased studies[16][17][18]Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
However , the conversion to a psychiatric disorder and need for psychiatric care is probably mediated by environmental risk factors as well as factors such as coping style , cognitive biases and negative emotional affect ( Auditory verbal hallucinations in persons with and without a need for care , Kompus , Connell et al . , 2014).Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Also , the developmental trajectories of language networks in the brain , implicated in the neural basis of AVH ( Altered integrity of perisylvian language pathways in schizophrenia Relationship to auditory hallucinations , Craig , Forkel et al . , 2011 ) , differ between adolescent boys and girls ( Hirnstein , Westerhausen , Korsnes & amp ; Hugdahl , 2013)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Furthermore , childhood trauma and childhood sexual abuse is more often experienced by females ( Janssen et al . , 2004;Molnar et al . , 2001 ) and is also one of the strongest risk factors for developing clinically impairing AVH and psychotic symptoms ( Daalman et al . , 2012;de A comprehensive review of auditory verbal hallucinations lifetime prevalence correlates and mechanisms in healthy and clinical individuals ; Barkus , 2013;Janssen et al . , 2004)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
In contrast to the transient AVH , persistent AVH appear to increase the risk for depressed mood and general psychopathology in longitudinal studies ( Persistence and outcome of auditory hallucinations in adolescence A longitudinal general population study of 1800 individuals , Gunther , Drukker et al . , 2011 ) , and AVH in later adolescence appears to have stronger association with psychiatric disorders compared to AVH in younger age groups ( Kelleher , Keeley , Corcoran et al . , 2012b)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1
Also , the developmental trajectories of language networks in the brain , implicated in the neural basis of AVH ( Catani , Craig , Forkel et al . , 2011 ) , differ between adolescent boys and girls ( Sex differences in language asymmetry are age dependent and small A large scale consonant vowel dichotic listening study with behavioral and fMRI data , Westerhausen , Korsnes & amp ; Hugdahl , 2013)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	0
Findings from research on ultra - high psychosis risk groups have suggested inclusion of additional predictors of psychosis , e.g. , negative symptoms , cognitive and social functioning , in addition to attenuated positive symptoms such as AVH ( The psychosis high risk state a comprehensive state of the art review , Borgwardt , Bechdolf et al . , 2013).)Prevalence of auditory hallucinations in Norwegian adolescents : Results from a population - based study	1

This discrepancy supports previous studies which point to the fact that linking agrammatism to effects of regularity in the dual mechanism account needs to be revised ( De Diego Balaguer et al . , 2004;Laiacona and Caramazza , 2004;Grammatical processing of nouns and verbs in left frontal cortex and Caramazza , 2003)Morpho - syntactic processing of Arabic plurals after aphasia : dissecting lexical meaning from morpho - syntax within word boundaries	1

The double - blind , placebo - controlled , phase 3 trial everolimus for angiomyolipoma in TSC where this patient took part , found an angiomyolipoma response rate of 42 % for everolimus treatment , which contrasted with a 0 % response for placebo ( Everolimus for angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis EXIST 2 a multicentre randomised double blind placebo controlled trial et al , 2013)Everolimus improves behavioral deficits in a patient with autism associated with tuberous sclerosis : a case report	1
Clinical trials in TSC populations using everolimus as mTOR inhibitor , have shown promising results regarding epilepsy , skin manifestations , subependymal giant cell astrocytomas ( SEGAs ) , and renal and lung manifestations ( Bissler et al . , 2008 ) and also improved subependymal giant cell astrocytomas ( SEGAs ) , specific brain tumors associated with TSC ( Krueger et al , 2010 ; Jzwiak et al 2012 ; Curran et al 2012 ; Efficacy and safety of everolimus for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex EXIST 1 a multicentre randomised et al , 2013)Everolimus improves behavioral deficits in a patient with autism associated with tuberous sclerosis : a case report	1
Autism may be present in up to 60 % of these patients , and TSC accounts for 1 to 4 % of all cases of autism ( Epidemiological surveys of autism and other pervasive developmental disorders an update , 2003;Curatolo et al , 2004;Ehninger , 2013)Everolimus improves behavioral deficits in a patient with autism associated with tuberous sclerosis : a case report	0

Private equity takeovers of mature firms can themselves be divided into several sub - categories , although , once more , these are often conflated in the literature ( Private Equity A Review and Synthesis and Wright , 2009)THE EMPLOYMENT CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATE EQUITY ACQUISITIONS : THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL BUY OUTS	0
This is especially important since the consequences for employees are expected to depend on the type of private equity takeover in question . Private equity is a term frequently used to refer to two substantially different types of corporate investment ( Private equity and human resource management An emerging agenda and Wright , 2010)THE EMPLOYMENT CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATE EQUITY ACQUISITIONS : THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL BUY OUTS	0

Running parallel to concerns in the policy community , an emerging strand of academic enquiry has begun to examine the employment consequences of private equity takeovers , largely motivated by the seminal work of Breach of trust in hostile takeovers , who suggested that acquisitions may provide an opportunity for managers to challenge any implicit contracts between employees and the firm , thereby expropriating the formerTHE EMPLOYMENT CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATE EQUITY ACQUISITIONS : THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL BUY OUTS	1
Finally , institutional buy outs ( IBOs ) involve private equity and other institutional investors ; here managers do not hold any shares at all , unless this is part of their reward package ( Why do public firms go private in the UK The impact of private equity investors incentive realignment and undervaluation et al . , 2007).Both Davis et alTHE EMPLOYMENT CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATE EQUITY ACQUISITIONS : THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL BUY OUTS	0

Indeed , both politicians and trade union representatives have raised serious concerns regarding the potential consequences of private equity acquisitions for the welfare of employees in acquired firms , calling for stronger regulation and greater transparency in respect of the activities of private equity acquirers ( TUC challenges private equity to talks , 2007;Treasury Select Committee , 2007)THE EMPLOYMENT CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATE EQUITY ACQUISITIONS : THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL BUY OUTS	1

The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance , specifically forest clear - cutting , grazing and agricultural practices , associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century ( Historical land use practices and dune instability in the Province Lands;Stilgoe , 1981;Rubertone , 1985;Motzkin et al . , 2002;Eberhardt et al . , 2003;Forman et al . , 2008)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	1
The sands analyzed have a SiO 2 content of & gt;90 % of the noncarbonate fraction and are predominantly a moderately to well sorted medium to coarse sand with & gt;80 % quartz grains , reflecting the mineralogy of underlying Pleistocene outwash , a likely source for the eolian sand ( Mineralogy and provenance of Pleistocene outwash plain and modern beach sands of outer Cape Cod and Hubert , 1996)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	0
The presence of snow ramparts and interstitial layers mostly composed of snow can enhance eolian accretion and dune movement ( Koster and Dijkmans , 1988;Dijkmans and Mucher , 1989;Sedimentary structures of cold climate coastal dunes and Allard , 1995)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	0
The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance , specifically forest clear - cutting , grazing and agricultural practices , associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century ( McCaffrey and Leatherman , 1979;A New England coastal wilderness , 1981;Rubertone , 1985;Motzkin et al . , 2002;Eberhardt et al . , 2003;Forman et al . , 2008)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	1
Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport ( Barchyn and Hugenholtz , 2012;Ollerhead et al . , 2013 ) , though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release ( Sublimation and aeolian sand movement from a frozen surface Experimental results from Presquille Beach and Law , 1995)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	1

Often the presence of snow and interstitial ice binds eolian particles to surfaces necessitating higher threshold shear velocities for transport ( Winter variability of aeolian sediment transport threshold on a cold climate dune and Hugenholtz , 2012;Ollerhead et al . , 2013 ) , though the sublimation rate may be an important factor in grain release ( Vandijk and Law , 1995)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	1
The development of single aliquot regeneration ( SAR ) protocols provides improved accuracy and precision for dating the burial time of eolian quartz grains ( e.g. , Murray and Wintle , 2003;Wintle and Murray , 2006 ) and needed resolution for dating young sediments , & lt;500 years old ( Optically stimulated luminescence dating of young sediments a review and Murray , 2009)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	1

Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system ( e.g. , The impact of North Atlantic storminess on western European coasts a review and Rendell , 2009;Hansom and Hall , 2009)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	1
Thus , dune migration on Cape Cod may reflect a pronounced period of storm or hurricane - related disturbance of the pine - dominated forest . Another factor that may influence eolian activity is periodic drought as documented by tree - ring time series that span the past 2000 years ( e.g. , Pan continental droughts in North America over the last millennium et al . , 2014)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	1

The accuracy of these age models are directly tested at three stratigraphic levels ( Butte and Central Valley 2 sites ) where there are calendar corrected 14 C ages ( Radiocarbon calibration curve spanning 0 to 50 000 years BP based on paired Th 230 U 234 U 238 and C 14 dates on pristine corals et al . , 2005 ) on buried wood ( Table 2 ) and these ages are concordant ( at one sigma errors ) with closely associated OSL ages ( Figures 5 , 6)Episodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	0
Activation of this dune system reflects fundamental sedimentologic controls on sand availability and supply and the persistence of wind speeds that surpass a threshold ( & gt;5 m / s ) for particle entrainment ( Dune forms and wind regime and Dean , 1979;Pye and Tsoar , 1990 , ppEpisodic eolian sand deposition in the past 4000 years in Cape Cod National Seashore , Massachusetts , USA in response to possible hurricane / storm and anthropogenic disturbances	0

This would be a conclusive evidence of the presence of impulsive heating mechanisms in coronal loops ( e.g. , On Solving the Coronal Heating Problem , 2006 , see Section 4.4)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
To explain both these pieces of evidence , several authors claimed that the loops can not be at equilibrium and that they must be filamented and cooling from a hotter state , probably continuously subject to heating episodes ( nanoflares , Hydrodynamic Modeling of Active Region Loops et al . , 2002Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Warm loops are well observed by EUV imagers such as SoHO / EIT , TRACE , and in most channels of SDO / AIA , and confine plasma at temperature around 1 -1.5 MK ( Temperature and Emission Measure Profiles along Long lived Solar Coronal Loops Observed with the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer et al . , 1999)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
In some cases it is possible to use coronal seismology ( first proposed by Uchida , 1970 ) to determine the average magnetic field strength in an oscillating loop , first used by TRACE observations of damped coronal loop oscillations implications for coronal heating et alCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics , such as the passband and the point response function : it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands , for instance , and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue ( e.g. , Del Zanna and Mason , 2003;Analysis of a multi wavelength time resolved observation of a coronal loop and Ciaravella , 2006;Aschwanden et al . , 2008;Terzo and Analysis of a multi wavelength time resolved observation of a coronal loop , 2010)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
The evolution of single coronal loops or single loop strands subject to impulsive heating was summarized in the context of the diagnostics of stellar flares ( Diagnostics of stellar flares from X ray observations from the decay to the rise phase , 2007)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Studies based both on models and on analysis of observations independently suggest that elementary loop components should be very fine with typical cross - sections of the strands on the order of 10 -100 km ( Beveridge et al . , 2003;Nanoflare Heating of the Corona Revisited and Klimchuk , 2004;Vekstein , 2009)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics , such as the passband and the point response function : it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands , for instance , and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue ( e.g. , Solar active regions SOHO CDS and TRACE observations of quiescent coronal loops and Mason , 2003;Reale and Ciaravella , 2006;Aschwanden et al . , 2008;Terzo and Reale , 2010)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
These equations can be solved numerically and several specific codes have been used extensively to investigate the physics of coronal loops and of X - ray flares ( e.g. , Nagai , 1980;Coronal closed structures IV Hydrodynamical stability and response to heating perturbations et al . , 1982;Doschek et al . , 1982;Nagai and Emslie , 1984;Fisher et al . , 1985a , a , a;MacNeice , 1986;Gan et al . , 1991;Hansteen , 1993;Betta et al . , 1997;Antiochos et al . , 1999;Ofman and Wang , 2002;Mller et al . , 2003;Bradshaw and Mason , 2003;Sigalotti and Mendoza - Briceo , 2003;Bradshaw and Cargill , 2006)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
From the comparison with the isothermal structure of hot loops derived from CDS data ( Di CDS SoHO multi line observation of a solar active region Detection of a hot stable loop and of a cool dynamic loop et al . , 2003;Landi and Landini , 2004 ) and a systematic inspection of the CDS atlas , the conclusion was that there might be two different classes of loops , multi - thermal and isothermal ( Figure 7).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
For instance , the different fuzziness measured in spectral lines forming at different coronal temperatures ( TriLiving Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4 pathi et al . , 2009 ) has been modeled with loops made of tens of independently pulse - heated strands ( Coronal Fuzziness Modeled with Pulse heated Multi stranded Loop Systems et al . , 2010;Reale et al . , 2011)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain these redshifts : downward propagating acoustic waves ( Hansteen , 1993 ) , downdrafts driven by radiativelycooling condensations in the solar transition region ( Reale et al . , 1996Reale et al . , , 1997b ) , nanoflares ( New insight into transition region dynamics via SUMER observations and numerical modelling et al . , 1999 ) ; the scenario is improving with the better and better definition of the observational frameworkCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0

The first coronal loop structures were identified properly after a rocket launch in 1968 , which provided for the first time an image of an X - ray flare ( Identification and Analysis of Structures in the Corona from X Ray Photography et al . , 1968 ) , with a resolution of a few arcsec .

For instance , the presence of tapering changes considerably the predicted distribution Possible deviations from pure 1D evolution might be driven by intense oscillations or kinks , as described in Three Dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic Models of Twisted Multithreaded Coronal Loop Oscillations ( 2009)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
This has been taken as part of the evidence toward steady coronal heating in active region cores ( Evidence for Steady Heating Observations of an Active Region Core with Hinode and TRACE et al . , 2010b , see Section 4.4).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Narrowband filters can show non - unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature ( e.g. , Patsourakos and Klimchuk , 2007 ) , due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands , but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics ( Isothermal Bias of the Filter Ratio Method for Observations of Multithermal Plasma et al . , 2005)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
These loops are invisible in the X - ray band and many of them depart from sunspots , appear coaxial and are progressively thinner for progressively lower temperature ions ( The pressure and energy balance of the cool corona over sunspotsCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Also , the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is above 2 MK , which is best observed in X - rays ( e.g. , Peres et al . , 2000;Comparison of Hinode XRT and RHESSI Detection of Hot Plasma in the Non Flaring Solar Corona et al . , 2009a;Warren et al . , 2011).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
Such strands are conceptually different from the thin strands predicted in the nanoflare scenario ( Nanoflares and the solar X ray corona , 1988 ) , which imply a highly dynamic evolution due to pulsed - heatingCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Narrowband filters can show non - unique dependencies of filter ratio values on temperature ( e.g. , The Cross Field Thermal Structure of Coronal Loops from Triple Filter TRACE Observations and Klimchuk , 2007 ) , due to the presence of several important spectral lines in the bands , but a more general problem can be the bias to detect narrow ranges of temperatures forced by the specific instrument characteristics ( Weber et al . , 2005)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
Further support to fine structuring comes from the analysis of the auto - correlation functions in SXT and TRACE loop observations ( Observational Appearance of Nanoflares with SXT and TRACE et al . , 2008)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain these redshifts : downward propagating acoustic waves ( A new interpretation of the redshift observed in optically thin transition region lines , 1993 ) , downdrafts driven by radiativelycooling condensations in the solar transition region ( Reale et al . , 1996Reale et al . , , 1997b ) , nanoflares ( Teriaca et al . , 1999 ) ; the scenario is improving with the better and better definition of the observational frameworkCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Global " ab initio " approaches have been developed ( An Ab Initio Approach to the Solar Coronal Heating Problem and Nordlund , 2005;Hansteen et al . , 2007 ; see also Yokoyama and Shibata , 2001 for the case of a flare model ) to model -with full MHD -boxes of the solar corona that span the entire solar atmosphere from the upper convection zone to the lower coronaCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Figure 15 tracks this evolution , which maps on the path drawn in the density - temperature diagram of Figure 16 ( see also Dynamics of flaring loops II Flare evolution in the density temperature diagram et al . , 1992)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Also , the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is above 2 MK , which is best observed in X - rays ( e.g. , The Sun as an X Ray Star II Using the Yohkoh Soft X Ray Telescope derived Solar Emission Measure versus Temperature to Interpret Stellar X Ray Observations et al . , 2000;Reale et al . , 2009a;Warren et al . , 2011).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
The emission from hot emission lines ( Ca xvii and Fe xviii ) has been confirmed from simultaneous observations with SDO / AIA and with the Hinode / EIS spectrometer ( Testa and Reale , 2012;Spectroscopic Observations of Fe XVIII in Solar Active Regions et al . , 2012)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
Similar results but different conclusions were reached after the analysis of a loop observed with SoHO , invoking a non - constant cross - section to explain the evidence of isothermal loop ( Models for Solar Magnetic Loops IV On the Relation between Coronal and Footpoint Plasma in Active Region Loops Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
Line - of - sight flows of up to 40 km s -1 were measured along warm and apparently static active region loops in co - aligned TRACE and the SoHO / SUMER observations ( Steady Flows Detected in Extreme Ultraviolet Loops et al . , 2002c)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Another puzzling issue , certainly linked to the loop isothermal appearance , is that warm loops are often diagnosed to be overdense with respect to the equilibrium values predicted by loop scaling laws ( Lenz et al . , 1999;Transition Region and Coronal Explorer and Soft X Ray Telescope Active Region Loop Observations Comparisons with Static Solutions of the Hydrodynamic Equations et al . , 2003a , Section 4.1.1)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0

They were first addressed by Foukal ( 1976 ) and later explored more with SoHO observations ( High Velocity Flows in an Active Region Loop System Observed with the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer CDS on SOHO et al . , 1997)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
The temperature gradient there is very large due to the local balance between the steep temperature dependence of the thermal conduction and the peak of the radiative losses function ( Closed coronal structures II Generalized hydrostatic model et al . , 1981)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Systematic triangulations and 3D reconstructions using the Extreme UltraViolet Imager ( EUVI ) telescopes on both STEREO spacecrafts were used to derive loop characteristics , such as the loop plane inclination angles ( First 3D Reconstructions of Coronal Loops with the STEREO A B Spacecraft II Electron Density and Temperature Measurements et al . , 2008(First 3D Reconstructions of Coronal Loops with the STEREO A B Spacecraft II Electron Density and Temperature Measurements et al . , , 2012Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0

This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh / SXT on the solar limb led to three Fabio Reale different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background ( A Method to Determine the Heating Mechanisms of the Solar Corona et al . , 2000;Aschwanden et al . , 2001;Reale , 2002a)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1

They have been later addressed as the moss in the TRACE images , which undergo the same effect , and their interactions with the underlying chromospheric structures began to be studied ( What is Moss   et al . , 1999;Fletcher and De Pontieu , 1999)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
A simple geometric description is reported in Temperature Dependence of Ultraviolet Line Average Doppler Shifts in the Quiet Sun et alCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh / SXT on the solar limb led to three Fabio Reale different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background ( Priest et al . , 2000;The New Solar Corona et al . , 2001;Reale , 2002a)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
Hydrodynamic loop modeling showed that Alfvn waves deposit significant momentum in the plasma , and that steady state conditions with significant flows and relatively high density can be reached ( Coronal loops heated by turbulence driven Alfv n waves A two fluid model , 2005)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
These warm loops would coexist with hot loops and would show a multithermal emission measure distribution ( Patsourakos and Klimchuk , 2007;Warren et al . , 2008a;Active Region Loops Hinode Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer Observations et al . , 2009 ) ; ii ) we might have warm loops as an obvious result of a relatively low average heating input in the loopCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
The amount of background depends on the instrument characteristics , such as the passband and the point response function : it is most of the signal in TRACE UV filterbands , for instance , and its subtraction becomes a very delicate issue ( e.g. , Del Zanna and Mason , 2003;Reale and Ciaravella , 2006;Aschwanden et al . , 2008;On the importance of background subtraction in the analysis of coronal loops observed with TRACE and Reale , 2010)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh / SXT on the solar limb led to three   different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background ( Priest et al . , 2000;Aschwanden et al . , 2001;Stellar Flare Modeling , 2002a)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
The analysis of a single loop observed on the solar limb with SoHO / CDS showed a bias to obtain flat temperature distributions along the loop from ratios of single lines or narrow band filters ( TRACE ) , while a careful DEM reconstruction at selected points along the same loop was inconsistent with isothermal plasma , both across and along the loop ( Observational Constraints on Coronal Heating Models Using Coronal Diagnostics Spectrometer and Soft X Ray Telescope Data et al . , 2001)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
In particular , whereas the loop total emission measure distribution should steepen above the canonical    1.5 ( Jordan , 1980;The Sun as an X Ray Star I Deriving the Emission Measure Distribution versus Temperature of the Whole Solar Corona from the Yohkoh Soft X Ray Telescope Data et al . , 2000;Peres et al . , 2001 ) dependence for temperature above 1 MKCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
In another study , hot monolithic loops visible with the Yohkoh / SXT were instead resolved as stranded cooler structures with TRACE at later times ( Cooling Active Region Loops Observed with SXT and TRACE ) , although the large time delay ( 1 to 3 hours ) is hardly compatible with the cooling time from SXT to TRACE sensitivityCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Density diagnostics through density - sensitive line ratio led to measure directly density values in active regions ( e.g. , The Temperature and Density Structure of an Active Region Observed with the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode et al . , 2007)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
From a differential emission measure ( DEM ) analysis with a forward - folding technique on SoHO / CDS data , some loops were found to be isothermal and others to have a broad DEM ( Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer Observations of Isothermal and Multithermal Coronal Loops et al . Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Also , the peak of the coronal emission measure of active regions -where the loops are brightest -is above 2 MK , which is best observed in X - rays ( e.g. , Peres et al . , 2000;Reale et al . , 2009a;Constraints on the Heating of Hightemperature Active Region Loops Observations from Hinode and the Solar Dynamics Observatory et al . , 2011).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
Resonances of coronal loops ( 1984 ) used a dissipation length formalism to propose resonance absorption of Alfvn waves as a potential coronal heating mechanismCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Also this hypothesis does not seem to answer the question ( The Inability of Steady Flow Models to Explain the Extreme Ultraviolet Coronal Loops et al . , 2004).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
First limited evidence of fine structuring was the low filling factor inferred for loops observed with NIXT ( Di Analysis and comparison of loop structures imaged with NIXT and Yohkoh SXT et al . , 1999 , see Section 3.3.2)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Temperature maps derived with combined filter ratios show fine structuring to the limit of the instrument resolution and evidence of multithermal   Hinode X Ray Telescope Detection of Hot Emission from Quiescent Active Regions A Nanoflare Signature   et al . , 2009 ) , and data in the medium thickness filters appear to constrain better this component of hot plasma as widespread , although minor , and peaking around log     6.8 -6.9 , with a tail above 10 MK ( Reale et al . , 2009b)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
The problem of background subtraction in loop analysis has been addressed by several authors , who apply different subtraction ranging from simple offset , to emission in nearby pixels or subregions , to values interpolated between the loop sides , to whole images at times when the loop is no longer ( or not yet ) visible ( Testa et al . , 2002;Del Zanna and Mason , 2003;The Effect of Background Subtraction on the Temperature of EIT Coronal Loops et al . , 2003;Aschwanden and Nightingale , 2005;Reale and Ciaravella , 2006;Aschwanden et al . , 2008;Terzo and Reale , 2010).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	0
Heating by nanoflares has a long history as a possible candidate to explain the heating of the solar corona , and , in particular , of the coronal loops ( e.g. , Hydrodynamics and Diagnostics of Coronal Loops Subject to Dynamic Heating et al . , 1993;Cargill , 1993;Kopp and Poletto , 1993;Shimizu , 1995;Judge et al . , 1998;Mitra - Kraev and Benz , 2001;Katsukawa and Tsuneta , 2001;Mendoza - Briceo et al . , 2002;Warren et al . , 2002Warren et al . , , 2003Spadaro et al . , 2003;Klimchuk , 1997 , 2004;Mller et al . , 2004;Testa et al . , 2005;Taroyan et al . , 2006;Vekstein , 2009)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Attempts of systematic studies have been performed in the past on Yohkoh and TRACE data ( e.g. , Soft X Ray Loops and Coronal Heating and Klimchuk , 1995;Aschwanden et al . , 2000)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Studies of NIXT loops including the comparison with hydrostatic loop models ( Section 4.1.1 ) pointed out that bright spots also visible in H   band were the footpoints of hot high - pressure loops ( Loop models of low coronal structures observed by the Normal Incidence X Ray Telescope NIXT   et al . , 1994)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Studies based both on models and on analysis of observations independently suggest that elementary loop components should be very fine with typical cross - sections of the strands on the order of 10 -100 km ( Beveridge et al . , 2003;Cargill and Klimchuk , 2004;Probing nanoflares with observed fluctuations of the coronal EUV emission , 2009)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
In particular , whereas the loop total emission measure distribution should steepen above the canonical    1.5 ( Jordan , 1980;Orlando et al . , 2000;The Distribution of the Emission Measure and of the Heating Budget among the Loops in the Corona et al . , 2001 ) dependence for temperature above 1 MKCoronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Observations of active region loops with EIS indicate that isolated coronal loops that are bright in Fe xii generally have very narrow temperature distributions ( 3   10 5 K ) , but are not properly isothermal and have a volumetric filling factors of approximately 10 % ( Observations of Active Region Loops with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode et al . , 2008a).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Light curves in the EUV band have been analysed also with a different approach : they have been compared to simulated ones obtained from sequences of random pulses with powerlaw distribution ( Can a Nanoflare Model of Extreme ultraviolet Irradiances Describe the Heating of the Solar Corona   and Safari , 2012)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
The slope of the power law is a critical parameter to establish weather such events are able to heat the solar corona ( Solar flares microflares nanoflares and coronal heating , 1991)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Another systematic analysis on another sample of Yohkoh loops in active regions ( Scaling Law of Solar Coronal Loops Obtained with YOHKOH and Tsuneta , 1995 ) confirmed some of the correlations in Porter and Klimchuk ( 1995 ) , but also found a correlation between the loop length and the temperature , and deviations from RTV scaling laws ( Section 4.1.1)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Models of loops made of thousands of nanoflare - heated strands were developed and applied to derive detailed predictions ( Some implications of the nanoflare concept , 1994)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
Among dissipation mechanisms phase mixing with enhanced resistivity was suggested by Damping Time Scaling of Coronal Loop Oscillations Deduced from Transition Region and Coronal Explorer Observations ( 2002 ) and supported by the analysis of Damping Time Scaling of Coronal Loop Oscillations Deduced from Transition Region and Coronal Explorer Observations and Wang ( 2008)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
This means that , for most of their lives , they can be well described as systems at equilibrium and has been the starting point for several early theoretical studies ( A loop model of active coronal regions and Monsignori Fossi , 1975;Gabriel , 1976;Jordan , 1976;Vesecky et al . , 1979;Jordan , 1980)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
In typical coronal conditions , i.e. , ratio of thermal and magnetic pressure     1 , temperature of a few MK , density of 10 8 -10 10 cm 3 , the plasma confined in coronal loops can be assumed as a compressible fluid moving and transporting energy only along the magnetic field lines , i.e. , along the loop itself ( e.g. , Rosner et al . , 1978;Numerical modeling of quasi static coronal loops I Uniform energy input et al . , 1979)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1

It has been shown that time - dependent loop models must include a relatively thick , cool , and dense chromosphere and the transition region for a correct description of the mass transfer driven by transient heating ( e.g. , The Influence of Numerical Resolution on Coronal Density in Hydrodynamic Models of Impulsive Heating and Cargill , 2013 ) and to maintain the necessary numerical stability ( Antiochos , 1979;Hood and Priest , 1980;Peres et al . , 1982)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
We expect better resolution switching from narrow - band instruments with few channels ( Weber et al . , 2005 ) to spectrometers ( Monte Carlo Markov chain DEM reconstruction of isothermal plasmas and Klimchuk , 2010;Monte Carlo Markov chain DEM reconstruction of isothermal plasmas et al . , 2012b ) , but it is difficult to achieve a temperature resolution better than   log     0.05 ( Monte Carlo Markov chain DEM reconstruction of isothermal plasmas et al . , 2012b)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1

Along a coronal loop in an active region on the solar limb , while TRACE double filter ratios led to temperatures between 1.0 and 1.3 MK , the emission measure loci from CDS data were consistent with a line - of - sight isothermal structure which increases in temperature from   1.20 to 1.75 MK along the loop , in contrast with the nearby multithermal background ( Comparison of High Resolution TRACE Data to Spectroscopic CDS Data for Temperature Determination et al . , 2008).Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1
In some of these studies , for instance , seismological techniques are used in order to measure flare - induced loop oscillations ( Ballai et al . , 2011 ) and waves and flows in active region loops ( Three dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling of Propagating Disturbances in Fan like Coronal Loops et al . , 2013;Uritsky et al . , 2013)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1

The upgrade driven by the higher quality of the data has consisted in the introduction of more detailed mechanisms for the heating input , for the momentum deposition , or others , e.g. , the time - dependent ionization and the saturated thermal conduction ( Bradshaw and Cargill , 2006;Nonequilibrium of Ionization and the Detection of Hot Plasma in Nanoflare heated Coronal Loops and Orlando , 2008)Coronal Loops : Observations and Modeling of Confined Plasma	1

Role of virus - induced IFN in PDL1 expressionSince type I IFN expression was observed in response to influenza infection and previous studies have suggested that these cytokines could induce PDL1 expression [ 18Interferon beta enhances monocyte and dendritic cell expression of B7 H1 PD L1 a strong inhibitor of autologous T cell activation relevance for the immune modulatory effect in multiple sclerosis ] , we investigated whether rhIFN could induce PDL1 gene expression in our MDM model ( FigViral infection of human lung macrophages increases pdl1 expression via ifn	0

CDT encourages the use of naturalistic idioms and allows the training talker to adapt their speaking style to perceptual difficulties ( Acoustic phonetic characteristics of speech produced with communicative intent to counter adverse listening conditions and Baker , 2011)Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	0
This method is based on techniques designed to share some of the features of CDT ( Effectiveness of computer based auditory training in improving the perception of noise vocoded speech and Summerfield , 2007)Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	1
Connected discourse tracking ( CDT : DeFilippo and Scott , 1978 ) has been reported as effective in training normal hearing listeners to adapt over several hours to speech that is vocoded and spectrally shifted Rosen et al . , 1999;Perceptual adaptation by normally hearing listeners to a simulated hole in hearing and Faulkner , 2006)Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	1
The speech processing is similar to that used in two previous studies Stacey and Summerfield , 2007 ) and simulates an eight - channel cochlear implant with upward frequency shifting representing the relatively shallow electrode insertions that are found in many CI recipients ( In vivo measures of cochlear length and insertion depth of nucleus cochlear implant electrode arrays et al . , 1998)Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	1

Listeners can adapt rapidly to low spectral resolution vocoded speech ( e.g. , Lexical information drives perceptual learning of distorted speech Evidence from the comprehension of noise vocoded sentences et al . , 2005)Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	0
When vocoded speech is spectrally shifted upward to simulate relatively shallow CI electrode insertions , shifts in excess of 3 mm of basilar membrane distance have large acute effects on speech perception ( Dorman et al . , 1997;Speech recognition with altered spectral distribution of envelope cues et al . , 1998)Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	1

These effects can be markedly reduced with training , but this requires several hours , substantially longer than for vocoding alone ; Fu and Galvin , 2003;Effect of training rate on recognition of spectrally shifted speech et al . , 2007;Rosen et al . , 1999)Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	1

For example , Comparison of word sentence and phoneme based training strategies in improving the perception of spectrally distorted speech and Summerfield ( 2008 ) found that 3 h of sentence training using a similar shifted noise - vocoder led to improved sentence recognition but not to improved identification of vowels or of consonantsComparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	1
When vocoded speech is spectrally shifted upward to simulate relatively shallow CI electrode insertions , shifts in excess of 3 mm of basilar membrane distance have large acute effects on speech perception ( Simulating the effect of cochlear implant electrode insertion depth on speech understanding et al . , 1997;Shannon et al . , 1998)Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	1
Cochlear implant listeners show comparable adaptation to changes of frequency mapping ( Adaptation by a cochlear implant patient to upward shifts in the frequency representation of speech and Ketten , 2003;Fu et al . , 2002 ) , and several studies indicate that explicit speech - based training can facilitate this ( Fu and Galvin , 2008).Comparing live to recorded speech in training the perception of spectrally shifted noise - vocoded speech	1

A region of specific interest is the Callejn de Huaylas ( the valley drained by the Ro Santa ) in Peru , where water availability is determined by particular climate and topographical settings ( e.g. , The impact of glaciers on the runoff and the reconstruction of mass balance history from hydrological data in the tropical Cordillera Blanca Per   et al . , 2003)Comparing peasants perceptions of precipitation change with precipitation records in the tropical Callejon de Huaylas , Peru	0
While the highest glacier cover of up to 41 % is found in the northern Cordillera Blanca valleys , rivers draining the western Cordillera Negra are lacking in glacier contribution ( e.g. , Kaser et al . , 2003).Glacier contribution definitely has a considerable effect on the runoff of the Ro Santa during the dry season Toward hydro social modeling Merging human variables and the social sciences with climateglacier runoff models et al . , 2014 ) and even more so on the tributaries draining the Cordillera BlancaComparing peasants perceptions of precipitation change with precipitation records in the tropical Callejon de Huaylas , Peru	0

Introduction -considering different perspectives on a complex problemScientific evidence of climate warming and of projected resulting impacts can provide the basis for a responsible and efficient adaptation strategy if implemented in a timely and careful fashion , but can also be misused to legitimize particular interests ( Arnall et al . , 2014;Dietz , 2011;Regionality of monsoon onset in South America A three stage conceptual model , 2008)Comparing peasants perceptions of precipitation change with precipitation records in the tropical Callejon de Huaylas , Peru	1
It also takes account of potential complications caused by the different approaches of scientific groups in an interdisciplinary setting and by bringing together epistemologies represented by Western scientific knowledge with peasants ' local knowledge ( e.g. , Boelens , 2014;Escobar , 2008;Unexpected climate impacts on the Tibetan Plateau Local and scientific knowledge in findings of delayed summer et al . , 2014;Lennox and Gowdy , 2014)Comparing peasants perceptions of precipitation change with precipitation records in the tropical Callejon de Huaylas , Peru	1

In this view , the epistemological starting point is a recognition that markets ' do not simply fall out of thin air ' ( Kulturelle Geographien der Okonomie Zur Performativatat von Markten pp193 & amp ; Boeckler 2007 ;) but rather are phenomenon that are ' continually produced and constructed socially with the help of actors who are interlinked in dense and extensive webs of social relations ' Re - conceptualising the space of markets the case of the 2007 - 9 global financial crisis	1
To date , economic geographical thinking about markets in the heterodox tradition has either framed analysis of markets through the lens of political economic understanding neoliberal capitalism ( Peck 2010 ) , or tended to focus on specific aspects of market spatiality : the geographies of production ( Geographies of Production Growth Regimes in Spatial Perspective 3Toward a Relational View of Economic Action and Policy 2006 ) , circulation ( Berndt & amp ; Broeckler 2007 ;) knowledge exchange and market creation ( Hall 2006).Re - conceptualising the space of markets the case of the 2007 - 9 global financial crisis	1

In particular , as Geographies of circulation and exchange constructions of markets & amp ; Boeckler ( 2009 ) point out , ' socioeconomic ' work on markets has ' cast a strong shadow ' over the subdiscipline as economic geographers have shared the dissatisfaction of other social scientists outside of economics with neoclassical conceptions of the marketRe - conceptualising the space of markets the case of the 2007 - 9 global financial crisis	1

Even studies exploiting the within country variation in the data still show that transitions towards democracy are not necessarily associated with large improvements in economic outcomes ( Rodrik and Wacziarg , 2005;Economic and political liberalization and Tabellini , 2005;Persson andTabellini , 2006 , 2008)Political Reforms and Public Policies : Evidence from Agricultural Protection	1

In the literature , two main contrasting views can be distinguished concerning the effect of democracy on public policy outcomes ( Do democracies have different public policies than non democracies et alPolitical Reforms and Public Policies : Evidence from Agricultural Protection	1

Based on this logic , Why did the west extend the franchise Democracy inequality and growth in historical perspective and Robinson ( 2000;2006 ) predict redistribution from the elite to the citizens after an extension of voting rightsPolitical Reforms and Public Policies : Evidence from Agricultural Protection	1
As a consequence , voting models predict that democracies tend to redistribute from the rich to the poor , and this effect will be stronger with higher income inequality as the middle - class has more incentives to form coalitions with the poor ( see Alesina and Rodrik , 1994;Is Inequality Harmful for Growth   and Tabellini , 1994)Political Reforms and Public Policies : Evidence from Agricultural Protection	0

Management decision - making in this context is affected by managers ' interpretations of the available information at a particular point in time ( Managing Business Relationships et al . , 2003 ) also referred to as sensemaking ( Weick , 1979;Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1

Reviewing recent research on business networks and network change , the paper addresses the existing shortcoming in the literature with regard to a systematic understanding of change perceptions ( Using case methods in the study of contemporary networks and Trnroos , 2005 ) , and develops the concept of network change as well as an operationalization for the comparison of actor 's perceptionsSensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Companies are seen to interact based on their perceptions of the relevant network and their subjective sensemaking of the logic and exchange mechanisms relating to these activities , resources , and actors ( Ford et al . , 2003;Sensemaking and cognition in business networks Conceptualisation and propositional development et al . , 2006)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
For example , strategic research has looked at strategic groups , either as defined by objective characteristics ( McNamara et al . , 2003;Porter , 1985 ) or delineated by a shared understanding of different companies ( Strategic gGroups and competitive enactment A study of dynamic relationships between mental models and performance et al . , 2001;Reger and Palmer , 1996)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Management decision - making in this context is affected by managers ' interpretations of the available information at a particular point in time ( Ford et al . , 2003 ) also referred to as sensemaking ( The Social Psychology of Organizing , 1979;Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
Senior personnel changes in organisations ; shifts in organisational structures ; changes in strategy ; as well as acquisitions , mergers and bankruptcies can all cause such change ( Halinen et al . , 1999;Changing network pictures Evidence from mergers and acquisitions Industrial Marketing Management et al . , 2007).Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Following the argument that managers act on the subjective interpretations of their environment ( Borders et al . , 2001;Ford et al . , 2003 ) , which can be related to managerial research by Weick ( 1979 ; ( see also Mller , 2010 ) as well as socio - psychological theories of cognitive cycles ( Cognitive Psychology , 1967(Cognitive Psychology , , 1976 , network change must be seen in relation to how actors perceive their networkSensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
While this research tradition looks at structures of competition between related companies , the channel management or supply chain literature treats each individual business relationship as a separate entity , arguing that companies have to respond appropriately to changes in their business environment ( Achrol et al . , 1983;Planned and evolutionary changes in distribution channels , 1974;Stern and Reve , 1980)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Further , comparing different actors ' ascriptions of the explanatory mechanisms is important because companies adapt to perceived changes through interactions based on their understanding or anticipation of the changing environment ( Exploring strategy perceptions in changing environments and Falkenberg , 1989;Reger and Palmer , 1996).Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
However , comparing the perceptions of multiple actors , specifically the time and space specificity of change , remains an under - researched area ( Analysing business interaction 24th IMP Conference et al . , 2008)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
Such an analysis provides a flexible and continuous process of altering categories and finding increasingly suitable interpretations as the material is analysed ( Using templates in the thematic analysis of text , 2004;Piekkari et al . , 2010).A simple template relating to the dimensions of the framework allows the empirical data to be systematizedSensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1

For example , strategic research has looked at strategic groups , either as defined by objective characteristics ( McNamara et al . , 2003;Porter , 1985 ) or delineated by a shared understanding of different companies ( Osborne et al . , 2001;Managerial categorization of competitors Using old maps to navigate new environments and Palmer , 1996)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
They provide understanding of how managers react to changing environments ( The role of embeddedness in the evolution of business networks and Trnroos , 1998;Oberg et al . , 2007 ) and help to explain strategic decision - making behaviour ( Borders et al . , 2001)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Systematic combining an abductive approach to case research and Gadde ( 2002 ) for instance discuss a number of limitations : first , case studies are seen to provide little basis for scientific generalization ( Weick , 1979;Yin , 1994)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
As such , the concept of network pictures is influenced by , and related to , the research themes of cognitive strategic groups ( Osborne et al . , 2001;Porac et al . , 1989 ) cognitive scripts and cognitive mapping ( Fiol and Huff , 1992;Johnson et al . , 1998 ) , and managerial cognition / sense - making in organisations ( Colville and Pye , 2010;Toward a model of organizations as interpretation systems and Weick , 1984;Weick , 1995).Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Following the argument that managers act on the subjective interpretations of their environment ( Beyond the dyad Electronic commerce and network perspectives in industrial marketing management Industrial Marketing Management et al . , 2001;Ford et al . , 2003 ) , which can be related to managerial research by Weick ( 1979 ; ( see also Mller , 2010 ) as well as socio - psychological theories of cognitive cycles ( Neisser , 1967(Neisser , , 1976 , network change must be seen in relation to how actors perceive their networkSensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Others use concepts such as expansion and contraction ( Managing strategic change in a markets as networks perspective , 1987 ) ; extension and consolidation ( Cook , 1982 ) and splitting and joining ( Hertz , 1996)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
While this research tradition looks at structures of competition between related companies , the channel management or supply chain literature treats each individual business relationship as a separate entity , arguing that companies have to respond appropriately to changes in their business environment ( The Environment of Marketing Channel Dyads A Framework for Comparative Analysis   et al . , 1983;Guiltinan , 1974;Stern and Reve , 1980)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value - creating systems ( Parolini , 1999 ) where companies co - operate in order to develop value for customers and simultaneously compete to appropriate value ( Mller and Svahn , 2006 ; From value chain to value constellation Designing interactive strategy and Ramirez , 1993 ) , and marketing alliances where firms cooperate based on formalised and collaborative agreements ( Das et al . , 1998;Gulati et al . , 2000).While considerable research exists to explain business network structures in these different research traditions , the issue of change within networks is less well researched . Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
This subjective and narrow approach overlaps with An emerging strategy of direct research Administrative Science Quarterly 's ( 1979 ) notion of ' strategy as perspective ' , and provides a representation of actor - network embeddedness ( Halinen and Trnroos , 1998)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
For example , strategic research has looked at strategic groups , either as defined by objective characteristics ( Competetive positioning within and across a strategic group structure The performance of core secondary and solitary firms , 2003;Porter , 1985 ) or delineated by a shared understanding of different companies ( Osborne et al . , 2001;Reger and Palmer , 1996)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Thus , stability is a prerequisite for change ( Coordinating and mobilisation processes in industrial networks , 1992 ) and an inherent feature of a network ( Halinen et al . , 1999)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Recent research shows increasing interest in the concept of network pictures ( Henneberg et al . , 2009;The utilisation of network pictures to examine a company s employees perceptions of a supplier relationship and Mason , 2010;Tonge , 2010)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
An initial study of five exporters and seven importers was undertaken in 2006 ( Appendix 1 lists the companies involved ) as part of a larger study ( Sensemaking in Networks Using Network Pictures to Understand Network Dynamics , 2011)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value - creating systems ( The Value Net , 1999 ) where companies co - operate in order to develop value for customers and simultaneously compete to appropriate value ( Mller and Svahn , 2006 ; Normann and Ramirez , 1993 ) , and marketing alliances where firms cooperate based on formalised and collaborative agreements ( Das et al . , 1998;Gulati et al . , 2000).Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
As such , the concept of network pictures is influenced by , and related to , the research themes of cognitive strategic groups ( Osborne et al . , 2001;Competitive groups as cognitive communities The case of scottish knitwear manufacturers   et al . , 1989 ) cognitive scripts and cognitive mapping ( Fiol and Huff , 1992;Johnson et al . , 1998 ) , and managerial cognition / sense - making in organisations ( Colville and Pye , 2010;Daft and Weick , 1984;Weick , 1995).Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
For example , strategic research has looked at strategic groups , either as defined by objective characteristics ( McNamara et al . , 2003;Competitive Advantage , 1985 ) or delineated by a shared understanding of different companies ( Osborne et al . , 2001;Reger and Palmer , 1996)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Thus , while events relate to change , the sensemaking of decision - makers drives their behavior as well as the events , and thereby leads to change ( Behaviour and Mind , 1994)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
( 2003 ) and Developing network pictures as a research tool Capturing the output of individuals sense making in organisational networks ( 2008 ) suggest that network pictures , although based on individual managers ' sense - making , can be integrated by researchers to form a broad pictureSensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
They are therefore posited to guide networking activities , but they are also used to ascribe meaning to events in the network , such as activities instigated by other actors ( Ford et al . , 2003;Strategic management in an enacted world and Stubbart , 1985)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0

Interactions therefore cause a shared and inter - subjective understanding of the environment ( Daft and Collective mind in organizations Heedful interrelating on flight decks , 1984;Collective mind in organizations Heedful interrelating on flight decks and Roberts , 1993).Conversely , Ford et alSensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1

Introduction Managers often want to change distribution structures or their company 's position in a network ( Benefiting from network position Firm capabilities structural holes and performance and Bell , 2005)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
First , it has developed an analytical framework illustrating how actors describe mainly been discussed as a theoretical construct and only a few studies exist using them as a research tool ( Picture this Managed change and resistance in business network settings Industrial Marketing Management and Andersen , 2009;Oberg et al . , 2007)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
Business Networks and ChangeRecent research has stressed the importance of network structures in understanding business exchanges ( Changes in the theory of interorganizational relations in marketing paradigm , 1997;Mller and Rajala , 2007)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
While considerable research exists to explain business network structures in these different research traditions , the issue of change within networks is less well researched . Although there are several approaches to analysing relationships in terms of networks ( see Networks in Socioeconomic Systems A Critical Review for an overview ) , this article adopts the industrial network approach , underpinned by the interaction model , to understand different actors ' behavior ( Ford et al . , 2003;)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
An Analytical Framework of Network ChangeWhether or not change is perceived similarly by different actors in a specific network is of key interest , as differences or similarities in any firm 's perspective can be used to understand strategic behaviour ( The role of competitive croups in strategy formulation A dynamic integration of two competing models   and Thomas , 1993;Osborne et al . , 2001)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Others use concepts such as expansion and contraction ( Mattsson , 1987 ) ; extension and consolidation ( Network structure from from an exchange perspective , 1982 ) and splitting and joining ( Hertz , 1996)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value - creating systems ( Parolini , 1999 ) where companies co - operate in order to develop value for customers and simultaneously compete to appropriate value ( Mller and Svahn , 2006 ; Normann and Ramirez , 1993 ) , and marketing alliances where firms cooperate based on formalised and collaborative agreements ( Impact of strategic alliances on firm valuation et al . , 1998;Gulati et al . , 2000).Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
As such , network pictures are akin to metaphors : they are rich sense - making devices in their own right ( Metaphors of Memory , 2000)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Change may be seen as an evolutionary process , where revolution is possible but unusual ( Industrial Networks A review , 1992 ) , similar to a continuous process where stable periods are broken by radical changes ( Halinen et al . , 1999)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
Second , case studies are often rich descriptions of events without clear analytical framing ; they at best only partially support quasi - deductive theories , and they suggest some notion of statistical generalization where multiple case studies are used ( Case research as a methodology for industrial networks , 1995)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1

knowing what knowledge or inferences may be relevant or irrelevant to a specific issue ( Does trust matter Exploring the effects of interorganizational and interpersonal trust on performance et al . , 1998)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0
Therefore , the location of change needs to be analysed , depending on whether it occurs at the actor , dyad , or network level ( Halinen et al . , 1999;Relevance of Focal Nets in Understanding the Dynamics of Business Relationships et al . , 1999)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
Defined in this broad sense , network pictures can , for example , be used to trace the development of a whole network longitudinally ( Making sense of network dynamics through network pictures A longitudinal case study Industrial Marketing Management and Redwood , 2005)Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
However , the level of change could also reside in the network itself , affecting the whole business system ( Stability and change in network relationships and Mattsson , 1987;Havila and Salmi , 2000).Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	1
Business networks have also been characterised in strategic marketing as value - creating systems ( Parolini , 1999 ) where companies co - operate in order to develop value for customers and simultaneously compete to appropriate value ( Mller and Svahn , 2006 ; Normann and Ramirez , 1993 ) , and marketing alliances where firms cooperate based on formalised and collaborative agreements ( Das et al . , 1998;Strategic networks et al . , 2000).Sensemaking in business networks : Introducing dottograms to analyse network changes	0

It is argued that firms will respond to stringent labour regulation by substituting capital for labour ; even there will be a shift in production from the formal sector to unregulated areas of the economy and/or flight of capital and relocation of production in a country with more market - friendly labour regulation ( The impact of changes in job security legislation in India and Zimbabwe and Lucas , 1993;Heckman and Pags , 2000;Botero et al . , 2004)Does employment protection lead to unemployment ?

These models , however , over - emphasised the forces of ' realisation ' and overlooked the ' profit squeeze ' force ( also pinpointed by Karl Marx ) -better income distribution and higher real wages reduce profitability and dampen investment and growth ( see Bhaduri and Margin , 1990and Distribution and Growth A Critical Note on Stagnationism 1992 , 1993)Does employment protection lead to unemployment ?

If one intervention is shown to be both less costly and more effective than its comparator , then this intervention is dominant and is clearly the cost - effective option ; in such cases , no ICER needs to be estimated . Results of probabilistic analysis are also presented in the form of cost - effectiveness acceptability curves ( CEACs ) , which demonstrate the probability of supported employment being cost - effective relative to standard care at different levels of willingness to pay per extra unit of benefit , that is , at different cost - effectiveness thresholds ( Representing uncertainty the role of cost effectiveness acceptability curves et al . , 2001).The cost - effectiveness of supported employment for adults with autism in the United Kingdom	1

Outside the United States and Canada , however , social exclusion and nonparticipation in ISE has received less research attention . Studies on school trips to museums and science centers have argued that such trips benefit children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds ( Museums schools and geographies of cultural value , Phillips , & amp ; Woodham , 2009 ) and can affect some children over a year after their visit ( Bamberger & amp ; Tal , 2008)Not designed for us - How science museums and science centers socially exclude low income minority ethnic groups	0

In the case of FDI , internal governance ( the use of hierarchy ) supersedes external governance ( the use of markets and contracts ) due to market inefficiencies and failures ( The Governance of the Multinational Enterprise Insights from Internalization Theory and Casson , 1976;Hennart , 1982;Rugman , 1986;Williamson , 1981)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	1
Hence , governance costs are costs related to the governance of a relationship -be it within or across organizational boundaries -and according to TCE and internalization theory , the most efficient governance structure will be the one that minimizes governance costs in the long run ( Hennart , 1991;Transaction Cost Economics The Governance of Contractual Relations , 1979)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	1
Still , the original conceptual definition of the construct was not significantly changed by this deletion , although the definition may be somewhat limited in covering the whole range of monitoring costs . The final measurement model shows excellent fit on all fit statistics :   2 = 53.00 ( p & gt ; .28 ; RMSEA = .026 ; AGFI = .91 ; CFI = .99 ( Bollen , 1989;Jreskog and Srbom , 1981;A Fit Index for Covariance Structure Models Under Arbitrary GLS Estimation and Huba , 1985)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	0
When asset specific investments are high , there is a need for exploiting the company 's product / service technology in the local market , ensuring the accomplishment of the MNC 's mission in the FDI , and integrating the company 's business practices ( Knowledge Market Failure and the Multinational Enterprise A Reply and Zander , 1995)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	1

This actuates some degree of bargaining ( Does Knowledge Sharing Pay An MNC Subsidiary Perspective on Knowledge Outflows et al . , 2009).Monitoring costs arise when control precautions are established to drive down shirking and when resources are used to assure that agreements are fulfilled ( Dahlstrom and Nygaard , 1999;Hennart , 1991)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	0
Common method variance Since most of the variables in the study come from a questionnaire , variables in the study may be affected by shared and spurious covariance ( Buckley et al . , 1990 ) , which can be problematic since measurement artifacts and the phenomenon under investigation can be difficult to separate ( Common Method Variance in IS Research A Comparison of Alternative Approaches and a Reanalysis of Past Research et al . , 2006)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	0
The conventional way of dealing with uncertainty and safeguarding problems within TCE logic , is to bring both sides of a transaction into common governance , typically a firm ; which hence explains the vertical and horizontal boundaries of firms ( The Organization of Production Evidence from the Aerospace Industry , 1984;Williamson , 1985)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	1

Such decisions are usually long - term , inter alia due to various costs of switching between foreign operation modes ( Foreign Operation Methods and Switching Costs Conceptual Issues and Possible Effects et al . , 1999)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	0
Consequently , by implementing more formalized procedures such as rules and routines , clearer role responsibilities , and a better identification of complementary tasks and responsibilities between the MNC and the subsidiary , opportunities for opportunism are reduced ( Dahlstrom and Nygaard , 1999;Managing the R D Marketing Interface et al . , 1987)Governance costs in foreign direct investments : A MNC headquarters challenge	0

While RCA is formally endorsed by policy makers in USA , UK , Australia , and Denmark ( vretveit , 2005 ) and is in the process of being adopted by other countries , we have only a partial understanding of the challenges of using this approach , despite research suggesting it is not without problems ( Wallace , 2006;Braithwaite et al . , 2006;A root cause analysis of clinical error confronting the disjunction between formal rules and situated clinical activity et alPolicy and practice in the use of root cause analysis to investigate clinical adverse events : Mind the gap	1

For example , Organizational learning affirming an oxymoron and Westley ( 1996 ) warn that closure and consensus are often enemies of the capacity of organisations to learn from incidents that require them " to confront the possibility that the story being told is simultaneously a tale of disorder in which the reality of danger masquerades as safety and a tale of order in which the reality masquerades as danger " ( pPolicy and practice in the use of root cause analysis to investigate clinical adverse events : Mind the gap	1
As noted by NHS Inquiries A Time Series Analysis Public Money Management and Beck ( 2008 ) , the increasing number of NHS investigations can be explained in the context of " a return to big government " ( p.380)Policy and practice in the use of root cause analysis to investigate clinical adverse events : Mind the gap	1
These include providing a cathartic outlet for the wider public after a tragedy or scandal ( Inquiries Learning from Failures in the NHS London The Nuffield Trust , 2003 ) ; and constituting " ceremonial occasions that play an important role in the cultural adjustment stage of critical events " ( Brown , 2004 : 95 ) , especially in mitigating anxiety and maintaining institutional legitimacyPolicy and practice in the use of root cause analysis to investigate clinical adverse events : Mind the gap	1

In particular , the way RCA has been translated into practice ignores the idea that learning often stems from the inquiry process itself , not the report ; that the inquiry process should not be divorced from the practice of clinical work ; that emotions are part and parcel of the organisational learning process ( Power and emotion in organizational learning , 2001 ) ; and that focusing on feasible solutions ( a closure orientation ) and emphasising consensus reduces the capacity to learn through creativity and divergent thinking ( cfPolicy and practice in the use of root cause analysis to investigate clinical adverse events : Mind the gap	1

First , the hippocampus contains so - called " place cells " that encode where an animal is located in space , and so constitute what O ' Keefe and Nadel ( 1978 ) called a " cognitive map . " This role appears to apply to humans as well as to other mammalian species ( Knowing where and getting there a human navigation network et al . , 1998)Wandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	1
The revolution that wasn t a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior ( 2000 ) write of the " revolution that was n't , " suggesting a more gradual rise in technological sophistication from the Middle Stone Age around 250,000 - 300,000 years ago , and Shea ( 2011 ) similarly argues that human technology over the past 200,000 years is characterized by a variability that persists today , rather than by the abrupt appearance of " modern behavior .

It might also be interpreted as representing the experiencing of trajectories , either previously experienced or planned ( Mental time travel a case for evolutionary continuity , 2013)-in other words , mental time travelWandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	0
Indeed , language itself may have evolved precisely to allow communication about the non - present ( The evolution of language , 2009;Grdenfors and Osvath , 2010 ) , so we can share our mental travels to other places and other timesWandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	0
The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors ( e.g. , From Hand to Mouth the Origins of Language , 2002;Arbib , 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia , 2008)Wandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	0
For instance , scrub jays can recover cached food on the basis not only of where it was cached , but also of when it was cached , which might be taken to imply episodic memory of the caching episode itself ( e.g. , Can animals recall the past and plan the future   et al . , 2003)Wandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	1
Some have argued against the gestural theory on the grounds that it must have required an unlikely transition from a visuo - manual format to an auditory - vocal one ( e.g. , The Talking Ape , 2005;MacNeilage , 2012)Wandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	1
Rather paradoxically , this network is revealed by reverse subtraction ; that is , the activation during involvement in some designated task is subtracted from that under passive conditions in which subjects were given no explicit instructions , and were free to let their minds wander ( Unrest at rest default activity and spontaneous network correlations and Vincent , 2007)Wandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	1

The transition was probably not a dramatic one , since movements of the hand and mouth are coordinated in activities such as eating , and hand movements and mouth movements mutually interact ( Speech and gesture share the same communication system and Gentilucci , 2006;Gentilucci and Corballis , 2006)Wandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	1
The gestural theory was also boosted by the realization that the signed languages of the deaf are true languages , with full syntactic and semantic properties , albeit based entirely on visible movements of the hands and face ( Gesture and the Nature of Language et al .

The idea that mirror neurons may underlie the evolution of language has been elaborated by a number of authors ( e.g. , Corballis , 2002;From monkeylike action recognition to human language an evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics , 2005;Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia , 2008)Wandering tales : evolutionary origins of mental time travel and language	1
Two major landowners , the monastery of Klosterneuburg and the Burghers ' Hospital contested the ownership of land that was fluid ( Floods fights and a fluid river the Viennese Danube in the sixteenth century et alTwo steps back , one step forward : reconstructing the dynamic Danube riverscape under human influence in Vienna	1
The major channel shifts at the Viennese Danube therefore have to be interpreted against the background of the Grindelwald Fluctuation , the first extreme phase of the Little Ice Age from the 1560s to the 1620s ( Pfister 1980 , Pfister , 2007 , Behringer 1999;Changes in water and land the reconstructed Viennese riverscape from 1500 to the present et alTwo steps back , one step forward : reconstructing the dynamic Danube riverscape under human influence in Vienna	1
The GIS - based river and floodplain reconstruction method developed by Spatio temporal habitat dynamics in a changing Danube River landscape 1812 2006 was first applied to identify historical alterations of the Danube riverscape in the Austrian Machland region 160 km upstream from Vienna ( Spatio temporal habitat dynamics in a changing Danube River landscape 1812 2006 2008;Spatio temporal habitat dynamics in a changing Danube River landscape 1812 2006 et alTwo steps back , one step forward : reconstructing the dynamic Danube riverscape under human influence in Vienna	1

In order to conclude whether identified fluvial dynamics reflect the river 's typical behaviour rather than an exceptional hydromorphological state , climatic changes and related flood regimes also have to be considered ( Modelling channel evolution and floodplain morphology 1996;McCarneyCastle et alTwo steps back , one step forward : reconstructing the dynamic Danube riverscape under human influence in Vienna	0
It can be considered as the first map of the Viennese riverscape , which is depicted in a geographically largely correct manner ( Atlas of the Danube River Vienna A history of river training on maps and plans of four centuries O sterr Kunst Kulturverl Vienna Nanson GC Croke JC 1992 A genetic classification of floodplains and Michlmayr 1996;Opll 2004)Two steps back , one step forward : reconstructing the dynamic Danube riverscape under human influence in Vienna	1
Borders of land properties , hunting grounds or administrative borders also proved to be very useful ; in particular , the so - called Burgfriedsgrenze , the jurisdiction border of the Viennese magistrate established in the Late Middle Ages that stretched far north into the floodplain ( Alte Grenzen i m Wiener Raum 1986)Two steps back , one step forward : reconstructing the dynamic Danube riverscape under human influence in Vienna	1
