Hence according to this account which emphasizes the role of the hippocampus as the sparring partner of the neocortex sleep has the potential to make memories more accessibleIn contrast theories grounded in the notion of retroactive interference Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible  see also Mednick Cai Shuman Anagnostaras amp Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible  insist that during slowwave sleep synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is null	1
However as Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible    amongst others pointed out this approach is inherently blind to fluctuations at the itemlevel	1
By testing recall after intervals ranging between one and eight hours these researchers found that the presence of sleep in the retention interval had a protective influence forgetting curves were less steep for intervals filled with sleep than for those filled with active wakeNine decades down the forgetting curves the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established see Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible amp Cai  for a review	1
Thus on the basis of these nonlinear changes we know that for the sleep group something akin to systems consolidation had been triggered eg Sleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible et al 	0

To summarise what can be witnessed is that in line with institutional theory  DiMaggio and Powell Ashworth et al Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies et al  all the municipalities reported perceiving persuasive pressure to adopt personalisation measures both from outside the set of potential adopters referring to norms to conform to citizens needs or to be receptive towards national initiatives as well as from within the set of potential adopters referring to the norm to excel in relation to ones peers	0

Second the resource based view on the firm Diffusion of personalised services among Dutch municipalities evolving channels of persuasion Paper submitted to Local Government Studies Zahra and George  suggests that the socalled appropriability regime the extent to which organisations are risk averse or willing to accept ambiguities inherent in framing moderates the relationship between framing and eventual adoption of innovations	1

Perhaps unsurprisingly the reality of carrying out benefitcost analysis of federal regulations falls short of best practice and it does not appear to be having a significant impact on many regulatory decisions except higherprofile cases The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  	0
I will define these two terms in the sense introduced by The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  whereby the distinction turns on whether states of nature can be assigned precise probabilities  risk or not uncertainty or as it is often known nowadays ambiguity	1
In the present context this means that the decisionmaker focuses more on models yielding higher estimates of the SCC see also The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Dietz and Heal 	1
Doing so permits greater confidence that the target will be met while the existence of a longrun quantity target in the first place can be supported by reasoning about the efficiency of price and quantity instruments under uncertainty The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	1
 Having said that even if we only had one model at our disposal it would be natural to question whether the probabilities we have specified resolve all uncertainty and the answer in the case of physical forecasts of future climate and by implication economic forecasts would have to be in the negative The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	0
This seems remarkable since for example such temperatures are likely to test the limits of human physiology The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	0
To take the DICE model as an example The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  it can easily be shown that the assumption of a quadratic relationship between damages and temperature together with the modellers specific coefficient values implies that global warming can reach more than C before the equivalent of  of global GDP is lost	1
A recent paper by Ackerman and Stanton  attempts to answer it using the DICE model applying a functional form proposed by The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	1
Furthermore they also question the damage estimates of the models at low temperatures drawing on work by Michael The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  that argues damages could also be significantly higher in this realm	0
Using recent reviews of the literature we concluded that the range of estimates of the present SCC was a factor of ten larger than the corresponding range of estimates of the present MAC  The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	1
However in the long run with the existence of possibly catastrophic climate change the opposite seems to hold marginal benefits are steeply increasing upon reaching some stock of CO while marginal costs are fairly flatThis targetdriven approach to carbon pricing is now being followed in the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC  after several years of mixed experience in using the SCC beginning with The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis  	0
With some trepidation I will do likewiseIn outlining the second assumption note that simple averaging runs counter to most economic research on ambiguity which shows that individuals are averse to ambiguity as summarised in The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 	0

Perceptual decoupling may accordingly be part of a more extensive process that protects ongoing behavior see also Klinger Klinger   in regard to a meaningcomplex theory of response organization also behavioral chunking eg Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams basic principles et al 	1
It thus appears that although the respondent components of mindwandering may depend on the defaultmode network they are far from the only activity supported by that networkWhen tasks make large demands on processing the necessary shift of mental resources from the defaultmode network to executive regions is harder to attain with advancing age  Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams basic principles et al 	1

Again the point here is that encountering cues related in some way to ones goals takes higher processing priority over competing cues in a way that helps to explain the gravitation of undirected thought content to one or another of the individuals goalsOn the assumption that males are more likely than women to be concerned with power and hence be drawn to its cues Goal Commitments and the content of thoughts and dreams basic principles et al	0
