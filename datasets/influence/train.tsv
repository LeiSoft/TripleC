By testing recall after intervals ranging between one and eight hours these researchers found that the presence of sleep in the retention interval had a protective influence forgetting curves were less steep for intervals filled with sleep than for those filled with active wakeNine decades down the forgetting curves the beneficial impact of sleep on memory is well established see Memory consolidation amp Cai  for a reviewSleep not just protects memories against forgetting it also makes them more accessible	1
