The ROC curve and its properties have been extensively studied and are well understood see ROC Curves for Continuous Data for exampleAlthough monotonically increasing ROC curves can have convex regionsEvaluating diagnostic tests the area under the ROC curve and the balance of errors
Partly in an attempt to overcome this problem and partly in recognition of the fact that it is likely that not all values of sensitivity or specificity will be regarded as relevant various researchers have proposed the use of the partial AUC PAUC in which the integration in  is not over the entire range of sensitivity or specificitybut over some interval    a b within     regarded as of particular relevance see for example Analyzing a portion of the ROC curveEvaluating diagnostic tests the area under the ROC curve and the balance of errors
Incidentally it has been pointed out in Overestimation of the receiver operating characteristic curve for logistic regression that estimates of the area under the ROC curve based on the data used to derive the score function will tend to be optimistically biasedEvaluating diagnostic tests the area under the ROC curve and the balance of errors
Although the AUC has been criticised on various methodological grounds see for example Use and misuse of the receiver operating characteristic curve in risk prediction this interpretation suggests that it also has a core theoretical weakness at least when viewed from some perspectivesTo overcome this problem with the AUC we proposed an alternative measure which fixes the distribution of the relative severity of the consequences of the two kinds of misdiagnosisEvaluating diagnostic tests the area under the ROC curve and the balance of errors
